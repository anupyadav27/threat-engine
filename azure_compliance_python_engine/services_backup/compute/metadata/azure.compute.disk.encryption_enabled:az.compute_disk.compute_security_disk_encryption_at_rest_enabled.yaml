description: Validates that AZURE compute disk has encryption enabled:az compute disk
  compute security disk encryption at rest enabled configured according to security
  best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized
  access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures AZURE compute disk has encryption enabled:az compute disk compute
  security disk encryption at rest enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
