description: Validates that AZURE compute virtual_machine_scale_set has instance group
  instance profile least privilege configured according to security best practices.
  Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures AZURE compute virtual_machine_scale_set has instance group instance
  profile least privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
