description: Validates that AZURE compute securitygroup has allow ingress from internet
  to all ports, azure api management restapi waf acl attached, azure load balancer
  waf acl attached configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures AZURE compute securitygroup has allow ingress from internet to
  all ports, azure api management restapi waf acl attached, azure load balancer waf
  acl attached properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
