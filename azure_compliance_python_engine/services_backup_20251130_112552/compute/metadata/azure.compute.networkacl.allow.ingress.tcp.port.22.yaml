  estimated_time: minutes
  complexity: low
  steps:
    - Restrict ingress traffic on TCP port 22 in the Network ACL configuration.
    - Verify the changes using Azure CLI or the Azure portal.
context:
  business_justification: Prevent unauthorized access to compute resources.
  attack_scenario: An attacker could exploit unrestricted ingress on port 22 to gain unauthorized access.
  not_applicable_when: No Network ACLs are configured for compute resources.
