service: compute
resource: disk
requirement: Encryption Enabled:az Compute Disk Compute Security Disk Encryption At
  Rest Enabled
scope: compute.disk.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: 'AZURE COMPUTE Disk: Encryption Enabled:az Compute Disk Compute Security Disk
  Encryption At Rest Enabled'
rationale: Ensures AZURE compute disk has encryption enabled:az compute disk compute
  security disk encryption at rest enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that AZURE compute disk has encryption enabled:az compute disk
  compute security disk encryption at rest enabled configured according to security
  best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized
  access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.
