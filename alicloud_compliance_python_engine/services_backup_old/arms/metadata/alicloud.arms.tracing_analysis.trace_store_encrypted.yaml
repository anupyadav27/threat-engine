rationale: Ensures ARMS tracing_analysis has trace store encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ARMS Tracing Analysis trace stores have encryption enabled
