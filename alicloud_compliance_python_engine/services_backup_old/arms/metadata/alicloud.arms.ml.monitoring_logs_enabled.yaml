service: arms
resource: ml
requirement: Monitoring Logs Enabled
scope: arms.ml.monitoring
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: medium
title: Application Real-Time Monitoring Service Machine Learning Monitoring Logs Should
  Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures ARMS ml has monitoring logs enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that monitoring logs are enabled for ARMS Machine Learning components
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails and security visibility. Without proper logging
  enabled, security incidents and anomalous ML model behavior cannot be effectively
  detected, investigated, or reported for compliance requirements. This creates blind
  spots in security monitoring and may violate regulatory frameworks requiring detailed
  audit logs.
