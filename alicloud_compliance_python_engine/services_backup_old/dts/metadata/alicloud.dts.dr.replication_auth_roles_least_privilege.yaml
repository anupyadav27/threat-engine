title: Data Transmission Service Disaster Recovery Replication Authentication Roles
  Should Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DTS dr has replication auth roles least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Transmission Service disaster recovery replication
  tasks use authentication roles with minimal required permissions. Overprivileged
  replication roles can lead to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches,
  and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege
  access controls reduces the attack surface and limits potential damage from compromised
  credentials.
