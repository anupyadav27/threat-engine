title: Data Transmission Service (DTS) backup continuous replication should be enabled
rationale: Ensures DTS backup has continuous enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Transmission Service backup instances have continuous
  replication enabled to maintain real-time data synchronization. Without continuous
  backup enabled, organizations face increased risk of data loss during system failures
  and may fail to meet regulatory compliance requirements for data protection and
  business continuity.
