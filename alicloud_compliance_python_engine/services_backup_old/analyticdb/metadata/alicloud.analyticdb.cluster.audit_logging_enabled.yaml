title: AnalyticDB for MySQL Cluster Audit Logging Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has audit logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that audit logging is enabled for AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters
  to capture database access patterns, query execution, and administrative operations.
  Without audit logging, organizations cannot detect unauthorized access attempts,
  track data modifications, or meet compliance requirements for data governance and
  regulatory frameworks. This creates significant security blind spots and hampers
  incident response capabilities.
