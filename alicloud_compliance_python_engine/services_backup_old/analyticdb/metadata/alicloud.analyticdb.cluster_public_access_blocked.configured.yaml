title: AnalyticDB for MySQL Cluster Public Access Should Be Blocked
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster_public_access_blocked has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters are configured to block public
  internet access to prevent unauthorized data exposure and potential security breaches.
  Public access to database clusters increases the attack surface and may lead to
  data leaks, compliance violations, and unauthorized access to sensitive analytical
  workloads. Proper network isolation is essential for maintaining data security and
  regulatory compliance.
