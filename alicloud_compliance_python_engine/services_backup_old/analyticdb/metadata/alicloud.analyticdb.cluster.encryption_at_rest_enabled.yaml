title: Ensure AliCloud AnalyticDB for MySQL cluster has encryption at rest enabled
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters have encryption
  at rest enabled to protect sensitive data stored in the database. Without encryption
  at rest, data stored on disk is vulnerable to unauthorized access if physical storage
  is compromised. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements for data
  protection standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOX.
