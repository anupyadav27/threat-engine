title: AnalyticDB for MySQL Cluster Should Block Public Access
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters are not accessible from the public
  internet to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access exposes
  sensitive analytical data to potential attackers and violates security compliance
  requirements that mandate network isolation for database services.
