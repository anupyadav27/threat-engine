  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher
  for secure data transmission. Using outdated TLS versions exposes clusters to protocol
  vulnerabilities and man-in-the-middle attacks. This configuration is essential for
  meeting compliance requirements and protecting sensitive analytical data in transit.
