title: AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters should have multi-AZ deployment enabled with
  encryption at rest
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has multi az enabled with encryption at rest
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters must be deployed across multiple availability
  zones with encryption at rest enabled to ensure high availability and data protection.
  This configuration prevents data loss during zone failures and protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access, meeting compliance requirements for data residency
  and encryption standards. Clusters without both multi-AZ and encryption capabilities
  are vulnerable to service disruptions and data breaches.
