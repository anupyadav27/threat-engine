rule_id: alicloud.bss.ecs.regular_backups_configured
service: bss
resource: ecs
requirement: Regular Backups Configured
scope: bss.ecs.backup_recovery
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: medium
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances have regular backup snapshots configured
rationale: Ensures BSS ecs has regular backups configured properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have automated backup policies
  configured to create regular snapshots of system and data disks. Without proper
  backup configurations, organizations face significant data loss risks during system
  failures, security incidents, or accidental deletions, potentially violating business
  continuity and disaster recovery compliance requirements.
