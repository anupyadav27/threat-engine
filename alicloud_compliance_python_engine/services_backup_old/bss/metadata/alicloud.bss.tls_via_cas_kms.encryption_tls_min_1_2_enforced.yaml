title: Business Support System TLS certificates via Certificate Authority Service
  and Key Management Service must enforce minimum TLS 1.2 encryption
rationale: Ensures BSS tls_via_cas_kms has encryption tls min 1 2 enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that TLS certificates managed through Certificate Authority Service
  and Key Management Service enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for Business Support
  System communications. Using outdated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1) exposes encrypted
  communications to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and protocol weaknesses. This
  requirement is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance
  standards for financial and billing system security.
