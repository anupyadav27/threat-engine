title: Alibaba Cloud Hybrid Backup Recovery Vault Encryption At Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures BSS vault has encryption at rest enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery vaults have encryption at rest enabled
  to protect backup data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive backup
  data stored in vaults remains vulnerable to data breaches and may not meet compliance
  requirements for data protection standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS. Enabling
  encryption at rest provides an additional layer of security for critical backup
  repositories.
