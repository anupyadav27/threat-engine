severity: low
title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch Service domains have fault tolerant master
  nodes configured
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH service has domains fault tolerant master nodes properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Elasticsearch Service domains are configured
  with multiple master nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Single
  master node configurations create a single point of failure that can lead to cluster
  unavailability and potential data loss during maintenance or unexpected failures.
  Proper master node redundancy is essential for maintaining service continuity and
  meeting availability compliance requirements.
