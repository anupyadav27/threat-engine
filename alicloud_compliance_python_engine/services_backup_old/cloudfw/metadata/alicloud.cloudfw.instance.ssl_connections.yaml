title: Ensure AliCloud Cloud Firewall instances have SSL connections enabled
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW instance has ssl connections properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: AliCloud Cloud Firewall instances should have SSL connections enabled
  to encrypt traffic and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. Unencrypted connections
  expose sensitive data in transit and may violate compliance requirements such as
  PCI DSS and GDPR. SSL encryption ensures data integrity and confidentiality for
  firewall management communications.
