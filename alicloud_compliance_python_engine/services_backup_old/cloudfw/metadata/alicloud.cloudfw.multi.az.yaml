title: Cloud Firewall should be deployed across multiple availability zones
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW multi has az properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Cloud Firewall instances should be distributed across multiple availability
  zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Single availability zone
  deployments create a single point of failure that could compromise network security
  controls during zone outages. Multi-AZ deployment is essential for maintaining continuous
  security posture and meeting compliance requirements for business continuity.
