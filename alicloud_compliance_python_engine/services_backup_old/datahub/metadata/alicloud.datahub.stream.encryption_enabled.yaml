  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.

  to protect data in transit and at rest. Unencrypted DataHub streams expose sensitive

  to data breaches and compliance violations with regulations like GDPR and PCI DSS.

  requirements.
