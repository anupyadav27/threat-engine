title: Ensure Container Registry repositories are private or have restricted access
  controls
rationale: Ensures CR repository has registry repo private or access restricted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Container Registry repositories are configured
  as private or have appropriate access restrictions to prevent unauthorized access
  to container images. Public repositories can expose sensitive application code,
  secrets, or proprietary software to unauthorized users, potentially leading to intellectual
  property theft or security vulnerabilities. Proper access controls ensure compliance
  with data protection requirements and maintain container image confidentiality.
