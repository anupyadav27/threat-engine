severity: low
title: Ensure Container Registry Repository Has Image Scanning Enabled
rationale: Ensures CR repository has registry image scanning enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Container Registry repositories have
  image vulnerability scanning enabled to detect security vulnerabilities, malware,
  and compliance issues in container images. Disabled image scanning increases the
  risk of deploying vulnerable containers to production environments, potentially
  exposing applications to known security exploits and failing compliance requirements
  for secure software supply chain practices.
