title: Ensure Container Registry External Public Publishing is Disabled
rationale: Ensures CR packages has external public publishing disabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that external public publishing is disabled for Container
  Registry repositories to prevent unauthorized access to container images. Enabling
  external public publishing exposes container images to the internet, potentially
  leading to intellectual property theft, security vulnerabilities disclosure, and
  compliance violations. Disabling this feature ensures that container images remain
  accessible only to authorized users within your organization.
