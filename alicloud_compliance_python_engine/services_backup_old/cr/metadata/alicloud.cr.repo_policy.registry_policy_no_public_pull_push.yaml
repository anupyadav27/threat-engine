title: Container Registry Repository Policy Should Not Allow Public Pull and Push
  Access
rationale: Ensures CR repo_policy has registry policy no public pull push properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Registry repository policies do not permit unrestricted
  public pull and push operations. Public access to container repositories can lead
  to unauthorized image downloads, malicious image uploads, and potential supply chain
  attacks. This control helps maintain image integrity and prevents unauthorized access
  to proprietary container images.
