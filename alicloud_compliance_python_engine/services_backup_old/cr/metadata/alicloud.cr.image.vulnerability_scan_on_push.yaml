service: cr
resource: image
requirement: Vulnerability Scan On Push
scope: cr.image.vulnerability_management
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: vulnerability_management
severity: medium
title: Ensure Container Registry images have vulnerability scanning enabled on push
rationale: Ensures CR image has vulnerability scan on push properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Container Registry repositories are
  configured to automatically scan container images for security vulnerabilities when
  pushed. Without vulnerability scanning on push, malicious code, outdated packages,
  and known CVEs in container images may go undetected, potentially compromising application
  security and failing compliance requirements for secure software supply chain practices.
