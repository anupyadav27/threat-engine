title: Ensure Container Registry repositories are not publicly accessible
rationale: Ensures CR not has publicly accessible properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Container Registry repositories are configured
  with proper access controls and are not exposed to public internet access. Publicly
  accessible container repositories pose significant security risks including unauthorized
  image downloads, potential exposure of proprietary code, and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. Restricting repository access helps maintain container
  image confidentiality and prevents unauthorized usage of your containerized applications.
