title: Ensure AliCloud Hologres instances have TLS encryption required for client
  connections
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES parameter has tls required properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Hologres instances enforce TLS encryption for
  all client connections through the tls_required parameter. Without mandatory TLS
  encryption, data transmitted between clients and Hologres instances remains vulnerable
  to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. Enabling TLS requirement helps meet
  compliance standards for data protection and ensures encrypted communication channels.
