title: Ensure Hologres Database Cluster Enforces Minimum TLS Version 1.2
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES database has cluster tls min 1 2 enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Hologres database clusters are configured to
  enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher for all connections. Using outdated TLS versions
  (1.0 or 1.1) exposes data in transit to cryptographic vulnerabilities and may violate
  compliance requirements. Enforcing TLS 1.2+ ensures strong encryption standards
  and protects sensitive data during transmission between clients and the Hologres
  cluster.
