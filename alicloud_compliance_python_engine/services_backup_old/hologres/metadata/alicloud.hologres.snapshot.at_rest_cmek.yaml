title: Alibaba Cloud Hologres snapshots should be encrypted at rest with customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK)
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES snapshot has at rest cmek properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Hologres snapshots are encrypted at rest using
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed keys. Using
  CMEK provides enhanced security control and compliance capabilities by allowing
  organizations to manage their own encryption keys, meeting regulatory requirements
  for data protection and reducing the risk of unauthorized data access.
