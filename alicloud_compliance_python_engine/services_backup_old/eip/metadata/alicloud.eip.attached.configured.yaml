title: Ensure Elastic IP addresses are attached to resources
rationale: Ensures EIP attached has configured properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Verifies that all allocated Elastic IP (EIP) addresses are properly attached
  to active resources such as ECS instances or load balancers. Unattached EIPs create
  unnecessary cost exposure and potential security risks through unused public IP
  addresses that could be targeted by attackers. This check helps maintain cost optimization
  and reduces the attack surface by ensuring all public IP resources are actively
  utilized.
