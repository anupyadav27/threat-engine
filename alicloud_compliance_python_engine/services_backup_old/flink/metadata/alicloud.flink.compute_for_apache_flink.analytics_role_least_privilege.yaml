title: Ensure Realtime Compute for Apache Flink Analytics Roles Follow Least Privilege
  Principle
rationale: Ensures FLINK compute_for_apache_flink has analytics role least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that analytics roles in Realtime Compute for Apache Flink are
  configured with minimal necessary permissions to prevent unauthorized access to
  sensitive data streams and computational resources. Overprivileged roles can lead
  to data breaches, unauthorized job modifications, and compliance violations with
  data protection regulations. Proper role configuration ensures secure access control
  and maintains audit trail integrity.
