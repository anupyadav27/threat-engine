subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Ensure AliCloud Config Recorder is Active in All Regions with Global Resources
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures CONFIG recorder has active all regions with global resources properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Config recorder is actively monitoring
  configuration changes across all regions with global resources tracking enabled.
  Without comprehensive multi-region monitoring, security teams may miss critical
  configuration drift, unauthorized changes, or compliance violations that could expose
  resources to security risks. Proper Config recorder deployment across all regions
  ensures complete visibility and audit trail for regulatory compliance requirements.
