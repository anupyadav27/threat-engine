title: AliCloud Config Service Compliance Monitoring Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures CONFIG compliance_monitoring_enabled has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that compliance monitoring is properly configured in AliCloud
  Config Service to continuously evaluate resource configurations against security
  and compliance rules. Without active compliance monitoring, organizations cannot
  detect configuration drift, security misconfigurations, or compliance violations
  in real-time, potentially exposing critical infrastructure to security risks and
  regulatory non-compliance.
