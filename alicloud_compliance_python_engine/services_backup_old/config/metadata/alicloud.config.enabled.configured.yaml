title: Ensure AliCloud Config Service is Enabled and Properly Configured
rationale: Ensures CONFIG enabled has configured properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: AliCloud Config service must be enabled and configured to continuously
  monitor and assess resource configurations for compliance violations. Without Config
  enabled, organizations lose visibility into configuration changes and drift, making
  it difficult to detect security misconfigurations and maintain compliance with regulatory
  requirements. This creates significant security risks as unauthorized changes may
  go undetected.
