severity: low
title: AliCloud Config Rule Remediation Targets Must Be Bound
rationale: Ensures CONFIG rule has config rule remediation targets bound properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Config rules have remediation targets properly
  bound to enable automated compliance correction. Without bound remediation targets,
  non-compliant resources cannot be automatically corrected, leading to prolonged
  security vulnerabilities and compliance violations. This creates operational overhead
  and increases the risk of security incidents due to unaddressed configuration drift.
