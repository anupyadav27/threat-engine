title: AliCloud Config Aggregator Aggregation Authorization Should Follow Least Privilege
  Principle
rationale: Ensures CONFIG aggregator has aggregation authorization trusts least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Config aggregation authorization trusts are configured with
  minimal necessary permissions to prevent unauthorized access to configuration data
  across accounts. Overly permissive aggregation authorizations can expose sensitive
  configuration information and compliance data to unintended parties. This control
  helps maintain data confidentiality and supports compliance with security frameworks
  requiring least privilege access controls.
