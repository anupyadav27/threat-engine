title: ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ Broker Should Use Cluster Deployment Mode
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ broker has cluster deployment mode properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ brokers are configured with cluster deployment
  mode rather than single-node deployment. Single-node deployments create single points
  of failure and lack high availability, potentially leading to message loss and service
  disruptions that violate business continuity requirements. Cluster deployment mode
  provides fault tolerance and meets enterprise reliability standards.
