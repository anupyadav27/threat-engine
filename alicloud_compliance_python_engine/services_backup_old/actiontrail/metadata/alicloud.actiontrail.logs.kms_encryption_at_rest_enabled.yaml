title: Ensure ActionTrail Logs Have KMS Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail logs has kms encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail logs are encrypted at rest using
  Key Management Service (KMS) encryption. Without proper encryption, audit logs containing
  sensitive API call information and user activities are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access if storage is compromised. Enabling KMS encryption helps meet compliance
  requirements for data protection standards and ensures audit trail integrity.
