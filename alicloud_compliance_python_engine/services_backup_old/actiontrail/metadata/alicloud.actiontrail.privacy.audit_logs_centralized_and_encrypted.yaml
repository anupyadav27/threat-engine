title: Ensure AliCloud ActionTrail audit logs are centralized and encrypted for security
  compliance
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail privacy has audit logs centralized and encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail audit logs are properly centralized
  in a secure location and encrypted both in transit and at rest. Non-centralized
  or unencrypted audit logs pose significant security risks including data tampering,
  unauthorized access, and compliance violations with regulations like SOX, PCI-DSS,
  and ISO 27001. Proper centralization and encryption of audit trails is essential
  for maintaining data integrity and meeting enterprise security requirements.
