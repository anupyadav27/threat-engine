title: AliCloud ActionTrail Threat Detection - Enumeration Activity Detected
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail threat_detection has enumeration detected properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Detects enumeration activities in AliCloud ActionTrail logs that may
  indicate reconnaissance attempts by attackers to discover resources, permissions,
  or system configurations. Such activities can be precursors to privilege escalation
  or data breaches and may violate compliance frameworks requiring monitoring of suspicious
  access patterns. Early detection of enumeration helps prevent potential security
  incidents and maintains audit trail integrity.
