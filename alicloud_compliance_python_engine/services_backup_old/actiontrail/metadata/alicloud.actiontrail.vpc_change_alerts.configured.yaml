title: Ensure ActionTrail VPC Change Alerts Are Configured
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail vpc_change_alerts has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail has configured alerts for Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) changes to detect unauthorized network modifications. Without
  proper VPC change monitoring, organizations cannot detect potential security breaches,
  unauthorized network reconfigurations, or compliance violations. Implementing VPC
  change alerts is essential for maintaining network security posture and meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements.
