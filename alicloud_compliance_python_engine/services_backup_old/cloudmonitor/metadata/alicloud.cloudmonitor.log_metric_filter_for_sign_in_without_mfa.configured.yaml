  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has a log metric filter configured
  to detect user sign-in events without multi-factor authentication (MFA). Without
  proper monitoring of non-MFA logins, organizations cannot detect potential unauthorized
  access attempts or enforce MFA compliance policies. This monitoring is essential
  for maintaining security audit trails and meeting compliance requirements for access
  control.
