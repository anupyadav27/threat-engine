title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor log metric filter is configured for Object Storage
  Service bucket policy changes
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR oss_bucket_policy_changes_log_metric_filter_enabled
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has a log metric filter configured
  to detect changes to OSS bucket policies. Without proper monitoring of bucket policy
  modifications, unauthorized access changes or privilege escalations may go undetected,
  potentially leading to data breaches or compliance violations. Implementing this
  metric filter enables real-time alerting on critical security configuration changes.
