service: cloudmonitor
resource: log_storage
requirement: Activity Logs Private Access Enforced
scope: cloudmonitor.log_storage.private_networking
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: private_connectivity
severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Activity Logs Enforce Private Access Only
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_storage has activity logs private access enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor activity logs are configured to
  restrict access to private networks only, preventing unauthorized external access
  to sensitive audit data. Unrestricted public access to activity logs can expose
  critical security events, user activities, and system operations to potential attackers.
  Enforcing private access helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations
  and reduces the attack surface for log tampering or information disclosure.
