title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Network Gateway Change Alarms Are Configured
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR network_gateways_change_alarm_configured has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Network gateway configuration changes can significantly impact network
  security and connectivity, potentially creating unauthorized access paths or disrupting
  critical network flows. Without proper monitoring and alerting, malicious modifications
  to VPC gateways, NAT gateways, or VPN gateways may go undetected, compromising network
  isolation and compliance with security frameworks. This rule ensures that CloudMonitor
  alarms are configured to detect and alert on network gateway changes.
