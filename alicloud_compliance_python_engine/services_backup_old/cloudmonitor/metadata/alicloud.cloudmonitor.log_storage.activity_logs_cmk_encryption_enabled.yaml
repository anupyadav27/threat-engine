title: Alibaba Cloud CloudMonitor Activity Logs Must Use Customer-Managed Key (CMK)
  Encryption
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_storage has activity logs cmk encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that CloudMonitor activity logs are encrypted using Customer-Managed
  Keys (CMK) rather than service-managed keys to provide enhanced security control.
  CMK encryption allows organizations to maintain full control over encryption keys,
  meet compliance requirements, and protect sensitive audit trail data from unauthorized
  access. Failure to implement CMK encryption may result in compliance violations
  and reduced security posture for critical monitoring data.
