title: Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network Domain Must Enforce HTTPS Protocol
rationale: Ensures CDN cloudfront has https enforced properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that CDN domains are configured to enforce HTTPS connections,
  preventing data transmission over unencrypted HTTP protocols. Without HTTPS enforcement,
  sensitive data transmitted through the CDN is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks,
  eavesdropping, and data tampering. This configuration is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for secure data transmission.
