title: AliCloud Dynamic Content Delivery Network (DCDN) Should Enforce HTTPS-Only
  Viewer Protocol
rationale: Ensures CDN dcdn has cdn https only viewer protocol properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that AliCloud DCDN distributions are configured to
  redirect or enforce HTTPS connections for all viewer requests. Using HTTP-only connections
  exposes data transmission to potential interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  Enforcing HTTPS-only protocols helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity
  while meeting compliance requirements for secure data transmission.
