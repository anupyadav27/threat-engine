rule_id: alicloud.cdn.distribution.origin_traffic_encrypted_tls1_2_or_higher
service: cdn
resource: distribution
requirement: Origin Traffic Encrypted Tls1 2 Or Higher
scope: cdn.distribution.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_in_transit
severity: medium
title: Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network distribution should encrypt origin traffic
  with TLS 1.2 or higher
rationale: Ensures CDN distribution has origin traffic encrypted tls1 2 or higher
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that CDN distributions use TLS 1.2 or higher protocols
  when communicating with origin servers to prevent data interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Using outdated TLS versions exposes sensitive data in transit and may violate
  compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and SOC 2. Proper TLS configuration maintains
  data integrity and confidentiality between CDN edge nodes and origin infrastructure.
