title: Ensure Dynamic Route for Content Delivery Network (DCDN) has Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) Web ACL Attached

  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DCDN distributions have WAF Web ACLs properly
  configured to protect against common web exploits and attacks. Without WAF protection,
  CDN endpoints are vulnerable to SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP
  Top 10 threats, potentially compromising application security and failing compliance
  requirements. Proper WAF integration ensures malicious traffic is filtered before
  reaching origin servers.
