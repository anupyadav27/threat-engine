title: AliCloud Content Delivery Network Distribution Must Have Logging Enabled with
  90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures CDN distribution has logging enabled 90 day retention properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud CDN distributions have access logging enabled with
  a minimum 90-day retention period to maintain adequate audit trails. Without proper
  logging retention, organizations cannot effectively investigate security incidents,
  track unauthorized access patterns, or meet compliance requirements for data retention
  and forensic analysis.
