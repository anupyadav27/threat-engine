title: AliCloud Dynamic Route for Content Delivery Network (DCDN) Access Logging Should
  Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures CDN dcdn has cdn access logging enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that access logging is enabled for AliCloud DCDN domains
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of content delivery activities. Without access
  logging enabled, organizations cannot monitor suspicious access patterns, investigate
  security incidents, or meet compliance requirements for data access tracking. Enabling
  access logging is essential for security monitoring, forensic analysis, and regulatory
  compliance in content delivery networks.
