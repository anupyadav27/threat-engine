title: Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network Origin Request Policy Should Not Forward
  Secret Headers
rationale: Ensures CDN origin has origin request policy no secret headers forwarded
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that CDN origin request policies do not forward sensitive headers
  like Authorization, Cookie, or custom authentication tokens to origin servers. Forwarding
  secret headers can expose sensitive authentication data and session information,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and compliance violations with data protection
  standards. This misconfiguration increases the risk of credential theft and session
  hijacking attacks.
