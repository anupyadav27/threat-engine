title: Content Delivery Network Domain Should Use Custom SSL Certificate
rationale: Ensures CDN domain has custom ssl certificate properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures CDN domains are configured with custom SSL certificates rather
  than default certificates. Using custom SSL certificates provides better security
  control, enables proper certificate management, and ensures compliance with organizational
  security policies. Default certificates may not meet specific security requirements
  and could impact trust relationships with end users.
