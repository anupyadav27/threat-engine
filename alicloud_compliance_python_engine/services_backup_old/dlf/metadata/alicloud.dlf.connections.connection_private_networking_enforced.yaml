title: Data Lake Formation Connection Private Networking Enforced
rationale: Ensures DLF connections has connection private networking enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation connections are configured to use private
  networking instead of public internet connectivity. This prevents data exposure
  during transit and reduces the attack surface by keeping data processing workflows
  within private network boundaries. Non-compliance increases risks of data interception
  and unauthorized access to sensitive data lake resources.
