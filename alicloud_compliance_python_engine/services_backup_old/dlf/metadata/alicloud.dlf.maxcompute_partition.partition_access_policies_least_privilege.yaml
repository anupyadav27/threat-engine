title: Ensure Data Lake Formation MaxCompute Partition Access Policies Follow Least
  Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DLF maxcompute_partition has partition access policies least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that MaxCompute partition access policies in Data
  Lake Formation adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum
  permissions necessary for users and roles. Overly permissive partition access policies
  can lead to unauthorized data exposure, compliance violations, and potential data
  breaches in big data analytics environments.
