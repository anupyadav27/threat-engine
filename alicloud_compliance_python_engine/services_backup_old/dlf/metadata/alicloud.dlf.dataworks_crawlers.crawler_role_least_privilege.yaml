title: Ensure Data Lake Formation DataWorks Crawlers Use Least Privilege IAM Roles
rationale: Ensures DLF dataworks_crawlers has crawler role least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks crawlers should be configured with IAM roles that follow the
  principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum permissions necessary for
  their specific data discovery and cataloging tasks. Excessive permissions can lead
  to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. This control helps maintain proper access boundaries
  and reduces the attack surface in your data lake environment.
