title: Data Lake Formation Schema Should Implement RBAC Least Privilege Access Controls
rationale: Ensures DLF schema has rbac least privilege properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation schema access follows Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC) least privilege principles by granting users only the minimum permissions
  necessary for their roles. Excessive permissions on data schemas can lead to unauthorized
  data access, data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
  Proper RBAC implementation reduces the attack surface and limits potential damage
  from compromised accounts.
