title: Data Lake Formation endpoints should be encrypted in transit
rationale: Ensures DLF endpoint has encrypted properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Data Lake Formation endpoints must use encryption in transit to protect
  sensitive data communications from interception and tampering. Unencrypted endpoints
  expose data to potential man-in-the-middle attacks and fail to meet compliance requirements
  for data protection standards. This security control ensures all API communications
  and data transfers are protected using TLS/SSL encryption.
