title: Data Lake Formation Crawler Roles Should Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DLF crawlers has crawler role least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation crawler roles are configured with minimal
  necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged crawler roles can
  lead to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. This check validates that crawler service roles
  only have the specific permissions required for their designated data processing
  tasks.
