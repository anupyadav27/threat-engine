title: Ensure Data Lake Formation DataWorks Crawlers Use Private Network Access Only
rationale: Ensures DLF dataworks_crawlers has crawler network private only properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks crawlers in Data Lake Formation are
  configured to use private network access exclusively, preventing exposure to public
  internet. Crawlers with public network access can expose sensitive data sources
  and metadata to potential security threats, violating data privacy regulations and
  organizational security policies. Private-only network configuration ensures that
  data discovery and cataloging operations remain within secure network boundaries.
