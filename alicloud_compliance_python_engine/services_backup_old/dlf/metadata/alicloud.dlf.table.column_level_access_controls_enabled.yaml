title: Ensure Data Lake Formation Tables Have Column Level Access Controls Enabled
rationale: Ensures DLF table has column level access controls enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Data Lake Formation tables implement column-level
  access controls to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data columns. Without
  proper column-level permissions, users may gain access to confidential information
  beyond their authorization scope, potentially violating data privacy regulations
  and compliance requirements. Enabling granular column access controls helps maintain
  data governance and supports compliance with frameworks like GDPR and industry-specific
  data protection standards.
