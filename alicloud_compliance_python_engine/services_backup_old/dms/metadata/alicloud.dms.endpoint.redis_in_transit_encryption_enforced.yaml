title: Database Management Service Redis Endpoint In-Transit Encryption Must Be Enforced
rationale: Ensures DMS endpoint has redis in transit encryption enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Redis endpoints in Database Management Service have in-transit
  encryption enabled to protect data transmission between clients and Redis instances.
  Without encryption in transit, sensitive data transmitted to and from Redis databases
  is vulnerable to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. This control is essential
  for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for data
  protection standards.
