title: Data Management Service (DMS) Classification Auto Discovery Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures DMS classification has auto discovery enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Management Service (DMS) has automatic data classification
  discovery enabled to identify and categorize sensitive data across databases. Without
  auto discovery, organizations may fail to identify sensitive data locations, leading
  to inadequate data protection measures and potential compliance violations with
  data privacy regulations. This feature is essential for maintaining comprehensive
  data governance and meeting regulatory requirements for data classification and
  protection.
