title: Data Management Service Classification Classifier RBAC Least Privilege Access
  Control
rationale: Ensures DMS classification has classifier rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Management Service classification classifiers implement
  role-based access control with least privilege principles. Excessive permissions
  on data classification components can lead to unauthorized data access, potential
  data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper
  RBAC implementation restricts classifier access to only necessary operations and
  data sources.
