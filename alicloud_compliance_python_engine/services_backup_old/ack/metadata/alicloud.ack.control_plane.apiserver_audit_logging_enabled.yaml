title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes API Server Audit Logging Should
  Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has apiserver audit
  logging enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that audit logging is enabled for the Kubernetes API server in
  ACK clusters to track all API requests and responses. Without audit logging, security
  incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and compliance violations cannot be properly
  monitored or investigated. This control is essential for meeting security compliance
  requirements and maintaining proper governance over cluster operations.
