title: Container Service for Kubernetes API Server etcd Connection Must Be Encrypted
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has apiserver etcd
  connection encrypted properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the API server in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters
  communicates with etcd using encrypted connections. Unencrypted communication between
  the API server and etcd exposes sensitive cluster data and secrets in transit, potentially
  allowing attackers to intercept authentication tokens, configuration data, and other
  critical information. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting security compliance requirements.
