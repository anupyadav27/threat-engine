title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters should implement
  default deny ingress network policies per namespace
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes network_policy has networkpolicy
  default deny ingress per namespace properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that each namespace in ACK clusters has a default deny
  ingress network policy to prevent unauthorized inbound traffic. Without proper network
  segmentation, pods can receive traffic from any source within the cluster, potentially
  exposing sensitive workloads to lateral movement attacks. Implementing default deny
  policies supports compliance with security frameworks requiring network micro-segmentation
  and least privilege access controls.
