title: Container Service for Kubernetes cluster control plane should have Pod Security
  Admission enforce mode enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has admission psa
  enforce mode properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Pod Security Admission (PSA) is configured in
  enforce mode on ACK cluster control planes to actively block non-compliant pods
  from being created. Without enforce mode, security policies are only logged or warned
  about but not actively enforced, leaving clusters vulnerable to privilege escalation
  attacks and container breakouts. Proper PSA enforcement is essential for maintaining
  Kubernetes security compliance and preventing unauthorized workload deployment.
