title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Addons Should Not Have Privileged Permissions
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes addon has addon no privileged
  permissions properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ACK cluster addons do not run with privileged permissions
  that could allow unrestricted access to the host system. Privileged addons can bypass
  security controls and access sensitive host resources, potentially leading to container
  escape attacks and compliance violations with security frameworks like CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
