title: Container Service for Kubernetes cluster should use private nodes only
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has private nodes only
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters are configured
  with private nodes only to prevent direct internet exposure. Public nodes create
  security risks by allowing direct access from the internet, potentially exposing
  workloads to unauthorized access and attacks. This configuration is essential for
  maintaining network isolation and meeting compliance requirements for sensitive
  workloads.
