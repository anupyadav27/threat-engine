title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Cluster Access Policy Network Restriction
  Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes instance has access policy network
  restriction enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ACK clusters have network access policies properly configured
  to restrict unauthorized network traffic and API server access. Without proper network
  restrictions, clusters may be exposed to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  potential compromise of containerized workloads. This control helps maintain compliance
  with security frameworks requiring network segmentation and access controls.
