title: Container Service for Kubernetes cluster should have Cloud Monitoring enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has cloud monitoring enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Container Service for Kubernetes clusters without Cloud Monitoring enabled
  lack essential visibility into cluster performance, resource utilization, and security
  events. This monitoring gap prevents early detection of security incidents, resource
  exhaustion attacks, and compliance violations. Enabling Cloud Monitoring is critical
  for maintaining security posture and meeting operational compliance requirements.
