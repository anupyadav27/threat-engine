title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes etcd Client TLS Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes etcd has client tls enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that etcd client communication in ACK clusters uses TLS encryption
  to protect sensitive cluster data and configuration information. Without client
  TLS enabled, etcd communications are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and
  data interception, potentially compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster security
  posture and violating compliance requirements for data protection.
