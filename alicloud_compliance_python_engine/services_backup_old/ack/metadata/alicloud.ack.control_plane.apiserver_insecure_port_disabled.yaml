title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes API Server Insecure Port Must
  Be Disabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has apiserver insecure
  port disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the Kubernetes API server insecure port (typically port
  8080) is disabled on ACK clusters to prevent unauthorized access to cluster resources.
  The insecure port bypasses authentication and authorization mechanisms, creating
  a critical security vulnerability that could allow attackers to gain full cluster
  administrative privileges. This configuration is essential for maintaining cluster
  security posture and meeting compliance requirements for container orchestration
  platforms.
