severity: low
title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) cluster dashboard access should be restricted
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has dashboard access restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ACK cluster dashboard access is properly restricted to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive cluster management interfaces. Unrestricted dashboard
  access can lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, and compromise of the entire
  Kubernetes cluster. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  by implementing proper access controls for critical cluster management components.
