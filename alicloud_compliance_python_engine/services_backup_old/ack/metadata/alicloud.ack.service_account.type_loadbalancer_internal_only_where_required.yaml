title: Container Service for Kubernetes Service Account LoadBalancer Should Be Internal
  Only When Required
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has type loadbalancer
  internal only where required properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Kubernetes service accounts with LoadBalancer type services
  are configured as internal-only when external access is not required. External LoadBalancers
  expose services to the internet, increasing attack surface and potential unauthorized
  access to cluster resources. This control helps maintain network segmentation and
  reduces exposure of sensitive workloads to external threats.
