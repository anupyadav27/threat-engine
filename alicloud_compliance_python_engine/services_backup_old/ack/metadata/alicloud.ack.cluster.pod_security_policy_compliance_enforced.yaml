title: Container Service for Kubernetes Cluster Must Have Pod Security Policy Compliance
  Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has pod security policy
  compliance enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters
  have Pod Security Policy compliance enforcement enabled to control pod security
  contexts and prevent privilege escalation attacks. Without proper pod security policies,
  containers may run with excessive privileges, access sensitive host resources, or
  violate security boundaries. Enforcing pod security policies is essential for maintaining
  container isolation and meeting compliance requirements in Kubernetes environments.
