  logging enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that audit logging is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes
  (ACK) clusters to maintain comprehensive security monitoring and compliance. Without

  may go undetected, compromising cluster security posture. This control is essential
  for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining detailed audit trails for forensic
  analysis.
