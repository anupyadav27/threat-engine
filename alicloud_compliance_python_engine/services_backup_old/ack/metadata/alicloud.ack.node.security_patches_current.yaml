title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Node Security Patches Must Be Current
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has security patches current
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that all security patches are applied to ACK cluster nodes to
  prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Outdated security patches expose
  nodes to potential attacks that could compromise the entire Kubernetes cluster and
  workloads. This requirement is essential for maintaining compliance with security
  frameworks and protecting against known CVEs.
