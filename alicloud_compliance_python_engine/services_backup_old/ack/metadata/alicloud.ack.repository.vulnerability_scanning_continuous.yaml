title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) repository should have continuous vulnerability
  scanning enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes repository has vulnerability scanning
  continuous properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) repositories
  have continuous vulnerability scanning enabled to automatically detect security
  vulnerabilities in container images. Without continuous scanning, newly discovered
  vulnerabilities may go undetected, exposing containerized applications to potential
  security threats and compliance violations. Regular vulnerability scanning is essential
  for maintaining secure container deployments and meeting security compliance requirements.
