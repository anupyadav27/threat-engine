title: Container Service for Kubernetes Cluster Should Enforce Approved Container
  Registries
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has approved container
  registries enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters are configured
  to only pull container images from pre-approved registries through admission controllers
  or policy enforcement. This prevents the deployment of potentially malicious or
  unvetted container images that could introduce security vulnerabilities, malware,
  or compliance violations into the cluster environment.
