title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Serverless Fargate Profile Logging
  Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes serverless has fargate profile
  logging enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that logging is enabled for Fargate profiles in ACK Serverless
  clusters to capture container and application logs. Without proper logging configuration,
  security incidents and operational issues cannot be effectively monitored, investigated,
  or audited. This creates compliance gaps and reduces visibility into containerized
  workload behavior and potential security threats.
