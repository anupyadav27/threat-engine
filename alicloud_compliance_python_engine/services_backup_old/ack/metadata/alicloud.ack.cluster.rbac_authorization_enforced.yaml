title: Container Service for Kubernetes Cluster Must Have RBAC Authorization Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has rbac authorization
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization is enabled
  on Container Service for Kubernetes clusters to prevent unauthorized access to cluster
  resources. Without RBAC enforcement, users may gain excessive privileges leading
  to potential security breaches and compliance violations. This control is essential
  for maintaining proper access governance and meeting security compliance requirements.
