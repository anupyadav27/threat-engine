title: Container Service for Kubernetes Service Account Token Auto Mount Should Be
  Disabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has token auto
  mount disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that service accounts in Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)
  clusters have automatic token mounting disabled to reduce attack surface. When automountServiceAccountToken
  is enabled, service account tokens are automatically mounted into pods, potentially
  exposing sensitive authentication credentials to compromised containers. Disabling
  auto-mount helps prevent unauthorized access to Kubernetes API and maintains compliance
  with container security best practices.
