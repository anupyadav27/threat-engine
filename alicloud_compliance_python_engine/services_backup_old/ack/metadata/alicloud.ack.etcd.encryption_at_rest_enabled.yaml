title: Container Service for Kubernetes etcd Encryption at Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes etcd has encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that etcd encryption at rest is enabled for Container Service
  for Kubernetes clusters to protect sensitive cluster data and secrets stored in
  etcd. Without encryption at rest, sensitive information including Kubernetes secrets,
  configuration data, and cluster state information could be exposed if the underlying
  storage is compromised. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for containerized workloads.
