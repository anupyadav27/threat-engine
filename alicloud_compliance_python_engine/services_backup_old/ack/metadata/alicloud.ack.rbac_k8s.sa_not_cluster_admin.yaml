title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Service Accounts Should Not
  Have Cluster Admin Privileges
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac_k8s has sa not cluster admin
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Service accounts with cluster-admin privileges pose significant security
  risks by granting unrestricted access to all cluster resources and operations. This
  excessive privilege escalation can lead to unauthorized data access, resource manipulation,
  and potential cluster compromise. Following the principle of least privilege is
  essential for maintaining Kubernetes security compliance and reducing attack surface.
