severity: high
title: Container Service for Kubernetes Cluster KMS Customer Master Key Encryption
  For Secrets Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has kms cmk encryption
  for secrets enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters have KMS
  Customer Master Key (CMK) encryption enabled for Kubernetes secrets. Without CMK
  encryption, sensitive data stored in etcd including passwords, tokens, and keys
  remain vulnerable to unauthorized access. This control is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for containerized workloads.
