title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes workloads should run as non-root
  user
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes workload has run as non root properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ACK workloads are configured to run as non-root users to
  minimize security risks and follow the principle of least privilege. Running containers
  as root increases the attack surface and potential for privilege escalation, which
  can lead to container breakouts and compromise of the underlying host system. This
  configuration is essential for meeting security compliance standards and reducing
  the blast radius of potential security incidents.
