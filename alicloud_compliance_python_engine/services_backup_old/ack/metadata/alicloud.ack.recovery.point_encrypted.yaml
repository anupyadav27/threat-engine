title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Recovery Points Must Be Encrypted
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes recovery has point encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that backup and recovery points for ACK clusters are encrypted
  at rest to protect sensitive application data and configurations. Unencrypted recovery
  points expose cluster secrets, application configurations, and persistent volume
  data to unauthorized access, potentially violating data protection regulations and
  compromising cluster security during disaster recovery scenarios.
