rule_id: alicloud.ack.managed_services.cluster_service_kube_system_services_not_public
service: ack
resource: managed_services
requirement: Cluster Service Kube System Services Not Public
scope: ack.managed_services.public_access
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: high
title: Container Service for Kubernetes kube-system services should not be publicly
  accessible
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes managed_services has cluster service
  kube system services not public properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule ensures that critical kube-system services in Container Service
  for Kubernetes clusters are not exposed to public internet access. Public exposure
  of system services like kube-dns, metrics-server, and other core components creates
  significant security risks including unauthorized cluster access and potential privilege
  escalation. Restricting public access to these services is essential for maintaining
  cluster security posture and compliance with container security standards.
