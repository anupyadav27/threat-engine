title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Namespace Default Service Account
  Automount Should Be Disabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes namespace has namespace default
  service account automount disabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that automatic mounting of service account tokens is disabled
  for default service accounts in ACK namespaces. When automountServiceAccountToken
  is enabled, pods automatically receive API credentials that could be exploited by
  malicious containers or compromised workloads. Disabling this feature reduces the
  attack surface and helps maintain compliance with container security best practices.
