title: Alibaba Cloud Container Registry Repository Encryption Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes registry has repository encryption
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Container registry repositories should have encryption enabled to protect
  container images and artifacts at rest from unauthorized access. Unencrypted repositories
  expose sensitive application code, dependencies, and configuration data to potential
  security breaches. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements and protects
  intellectual property stored in container images.
