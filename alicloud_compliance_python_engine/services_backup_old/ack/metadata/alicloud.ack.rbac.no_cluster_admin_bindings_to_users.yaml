rule_id: alicloud.ack.rbac.no_cluster_admin_bindings_to_users
service: ack
resource: rbac
requirement: No Cluster Admin Bindings To Users
scope: ack.rbac.security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Container Service for Kubernetes cluster should not have cluster-admin role
  bindings assigned to individual users
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac has no cluster admin bindings
  to users properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that cluster-admin role bindings are not directly assigned
  to individual users in ACK clusters. Direct cluster-admin bindings to users create
  excessive privileges and security risks, as they bypass proper access control mechanisms
  and make it difficult to audit and manage permissions. This violates security best
  practices and compliance requirements for least privilege access control.
