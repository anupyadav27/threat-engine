title: AliCloud Access Analyzer Should Be Enabled Without Active Security Findings
rationale: Ensures ACCESSANALYZER enabled has without findings properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures AliCloud Access Analyzer is actively monitoring resource access
  patterns without unresolved security findings. Unaddressed findings may indicate
  excessive permissions, unintended external access, or policy misconfigurations that
  could lead to data breaches or unauthorized resource access. Regular resolution
  of Access Analyzer findings is essential for maintaining least-privilege access
  and compliance with security frameworks.
