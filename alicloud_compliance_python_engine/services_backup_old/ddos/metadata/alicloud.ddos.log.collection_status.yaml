title: Anti-DDoS Pro Log Collection Status Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures DDOS log has collection status properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that log collection is properly enabled for Anti-DDoS Pro instances
  to maintain comprehensive security monitoring and incident response capabilities.
  Disabled log collection prevents security teams from analyzing attack patterns,
  investigating incidents, and meeting compliance requirements for audit trails. This
  creates significant gaps in threat detection and forensic analysis during DDoS attacks.
