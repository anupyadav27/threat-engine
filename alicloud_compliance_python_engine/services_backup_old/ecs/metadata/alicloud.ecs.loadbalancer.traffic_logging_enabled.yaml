resource: loadbalancer
requirement: Traffic Logging Enabled

domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service Load Balancer Traffic Logging Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service loadbalancer has traffic logging enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that traffic logging is enabled for ECS load balancers to capture
  detailed request and response information. Without proper logging, organizations
  cannot monitor suspicious activities, investigate security incidents, or meet compliance
  requirements for audit trails. This creates blind spots in network traffic analysis
  and hampers incident response capabilities.
