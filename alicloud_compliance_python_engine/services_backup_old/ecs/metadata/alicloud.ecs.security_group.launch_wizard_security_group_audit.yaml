title: Elastic Compute Service Launch Wizard Security Groups Should Be Reviewed and
  Replaced
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has launch wizard security
  group audit properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Launch Wizard security groups are automatically created with default
  rules that may be overly permissive and not aligned with organizational security
  policies. These default configurations can expose instances to unnecessary network
  risks and may violate compliance requirements for network access controls. Organizations
  should audit and replace Launch Wizard security groups with custom security groups
  that follow the principle of least privilege.
