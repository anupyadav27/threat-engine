title: Elastic Compute Service Instance Oracle Database Port Should Be Blocked from
  Internet Access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has oracle port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Oracle database ports (1521, 1522) are not exposed to the
  internet through security group rules on ECS instances. Direct internet access to
  Oracle database ports creates significant security risks including unauthorized
  data access, brute force attacks, and potential data breaches. This control helps
  maintain compliance with data protection regulations and database security best
  practices.
