subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service Custom Images Must Be Scanned for Vulnerabilities with
  No Critical Issues
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service custom_image has image vuln scanned no
  critical properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that custom ECS images have undergone vulnerability scanning
  and contain no critical security vulnerabilities before deployment. Critical vulnerabilities
  in base images can expose entire compute environments to security breaches and compromise
  compliance with security frameworks. This control helps maintain a secure foundation
  for all instances launched from custom images.
