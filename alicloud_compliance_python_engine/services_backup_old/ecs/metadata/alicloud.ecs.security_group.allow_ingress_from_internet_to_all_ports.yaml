title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To All Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to all ports properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to all ports. Such overly
  permissive configurations expose instances to potential security breaches, unauthorized
  access, and compliance violations. Organizations should implement the principle
  of least privilege by restricting access to only necessary ports and trusted IP
  ranges.
