rule_id: alicloud.ecs.instance.no_privileged_containers
service: ecs
resource: instance
requirement: No Privileged Containers
scope: ecs.instance.least_privilege
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should not run privileged containers
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has no privileged containers properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Privileged containers running on ECS instances have unrestricted access
  to host resources and can bypass security controls, creating significant security
  risks. This configuration violates security best practices and can lead to container
  escape attacks, compromising the entire host system and potentially affecting compliance
  with security frameworks.
