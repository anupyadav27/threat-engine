title: Ensure unused Elastic Compute Service security groups are removed
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has not used properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Unused security groups in Elastic Compute Service create unnecessary
  attack surface and complicate security management. These orphaned security groups
  may contain overly permissive rules that could be accidentally attached to instances,
  potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access. Removing unused security
  groups reduces security risks and helps maintain compliance with security governance
  frameworks.
