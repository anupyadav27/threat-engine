title: Elastic Compute Service Instance Profile RAM Role Policies Should Follow Least
  Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ram_role has instance profile role policies
  least privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that RAM roles attached to ECS instances have policies that grant
  only the minimum permissions necessary for their intended function. Overly permissive
  policies increase the risk of privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized access
  to sensitive AliCloud resources. This control helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks that require principle of least privilege implementation.
