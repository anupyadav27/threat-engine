title: Elastic Compute Service Network ACL SSH Port 22 Ingress Access Should Be Restricted
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has ssh port 22 ingress restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Network ACL rules do not allow unrestricted inbound access
  to SSH port 22 from any source (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted SSH access significantly
  increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access, brute force attacks,
  and potential system compromise. This control is essential for maintaining secure
  remote access practices and meeting compliance requirements for network security
  controls.
