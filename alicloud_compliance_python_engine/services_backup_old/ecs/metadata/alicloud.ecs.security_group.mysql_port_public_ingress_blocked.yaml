title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  to MySQL Port 3306
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has mysql port public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access to MySQL port 3306 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Exposing MySQL
  databases to public internet access significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and compliance violations. This control helps maintain database
  security by restricting MySQL access to authorized sources only.
