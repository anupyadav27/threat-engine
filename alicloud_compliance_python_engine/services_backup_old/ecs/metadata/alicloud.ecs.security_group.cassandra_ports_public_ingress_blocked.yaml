title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  to Cassandra Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has cassandra ports public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public ingress access to Cassandra database ports (7000, 7001, 7199, 9042, 9160).
  Exposing Cassandra ports to the internet increases the risk of unauthorized database
  access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations with data protection
  regulations.
