severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should not use deprecated paravirtual virtualization
  type
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has paravirtual type deprecated
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: ECS instances using paravirtual virtualization type are deprecated and
  pose security risks due to lack of hardware-level isolation and reduced security
  features compared to hardware virtual machine (HVM) instances. This configuration
  may impact compliance requirements and expose workloads to potential security vulnerabilities
  through shared kernel access.
