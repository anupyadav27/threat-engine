title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service disk snapshots are encrypted
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk has snapshots encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS disk snapshots are encrypted to protect data
  at rest. Unencrypted snapshots expose sensitive data to unauthorized access and
  may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Encrypted snapshots
  ensure data confidentiality and help maintain regulatory compliance for cloud storage.
