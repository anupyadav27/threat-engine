rule_id: alicloud.ecs.disk.volume_cmk_cmek_configured
service: ecs
resource: disk
requirement: Volume CMK Cmek Configured
scope: ecs.disk.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service disk volumes should be encrypted with Customer Master
  Key (CMK)
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk has volume cmk cmek configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS disk volumes are encrypted using Customer
  Master Keys (CMK) or Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed
  keys. Unencrypted or inadequately encrypted disk volumes expose sensitive data to
  unauthorized access and may violate data protection compliance requirements. Proper
  CMK/CMEK configuration provides enhanced security control and meets regulatory standards
  for data encryption at rest.
