title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To Cassandra TCP Ports 7199, 9160, 8888
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port cassandra 7199 9160 8888 properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted internet access to Apache Cassandra database ports (7199 for JMX, 9160
  for Thrift, 8888 for OpsCenter). Exposing these ports to the internet creates significant
  security risks including unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential
  compliance violations with data protection regulations.
