title: Elastic Compute Service Launch Template Security Groups Should Follow Restrictive
  Access Principles
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch_template has security groups restrictive
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ECS launch templates are configured with security groups
  that implement restrictive access controls, limiting unnecessary network exposure.
  Overly permissive security group rules in launch templates can lead to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and compliance violations across all instances created from
  the template. This control helps maintain consistent security posture and reduces
  attack surface for auto-scaled infrastructure.
