title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service custom images are encrypted with Customer Managed
  Encryption Keys
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service custom_image has image encrypted cmek properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Custom ECS images should be encrypted using Customer Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) to maintain full control over encryption keys and meet strict compliance
  requirements. Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted images expose sensitive data
  to potential unauthorized access and may violate regulatory standards. CMEK encryption
  ensures organizations retain complete ownership and management of their encryption
  keys.
