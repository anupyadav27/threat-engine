service: ecs
resource: vulnerability
requirement: Automated Scanning Scheduled Weekly
scope: ecs.vulnerability.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances have automated vulnerability scanning
  scheduled weekly
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service vulnerability has automated scanning scheduled
  weekly properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are configured with automated vulnerability
  scanning on a weekly schedule to maintain security posture. Regular vulnerability
  scanning helps identify security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and potential threats
  before they can be exploited. Failure to implement scheduled scanning may result
  in compliance violations and increased exposure to security risks.
