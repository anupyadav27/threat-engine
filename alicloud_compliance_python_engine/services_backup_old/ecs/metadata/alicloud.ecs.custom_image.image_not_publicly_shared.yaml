title: Elastic Compute Service Custom Images Should Not Be Publicly Shared
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service custom_image has image not publicly shared
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that custom ECS images are not shared publicly to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive data and intellectual property. Publicly shared images can expose
  proprietary software configurations, security credentials, and business-critical
  data to unauthorized users. This control helps maintain data confidentiality and
  supports compliance with data protection regulations.
