rule_id: alicloud.ecs.instance.os_version_supported
service: ecs
resource: instance
requirement: Os Version Supported
scope: ecs.instance.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should run supported operating system versions
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has os version supported properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances are running operating system versions
  that receive security updates and vendor support. Unsupported OS versions lack critical
  security patches, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers and
  may violate compliance requirements. Running outdated operating systems significantly
  increases the risk of security breaches and system compromises.
