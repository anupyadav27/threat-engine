rule_id: alicloud.ecs.compute_service.vm_root_volume_encrypted_cmek
service: ecs
resource: compute_service
requirement: Vm Root Volume Encrypted Cmek
scope: ecs.compute_service.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: high
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service VM root volumes are encrypted with Customer
  Managed Encryption Keys
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm root volume encrypted
  cmek properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS instance root volumes use Customer Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encryption rather than service-managed keys. Using CMEK
  provides enhanced security control and compliance capabilities by allowing organizations
  to manage their own encryption keys, meeting regulatory requirements for data protection
  and enabling proper key rotation policies.
