title: Elastic Compute Service instances must be properly configured with security
  settings
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances are configured with
  essential security settings including security groups, access controls, and monitoring
  capabilities. Improperly configured ECS instances can expose workloads to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and compliance violations. This check validates that instances
  meet baseline security configuration requirements for production environments.
