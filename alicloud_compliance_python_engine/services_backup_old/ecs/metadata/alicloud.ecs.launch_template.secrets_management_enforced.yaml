title: Elastic Compute Service Launch Template Should Enforce Secrets Management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch_template has secrets management
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ECS launch templates are configured to use proper secrets
  management services like Key Management Service (KMS) for sensitive data such as
  passwords, API keys, and certificates. Without enforced secrets management, sensitive
  information may be stored in plain text within launch configurations, leading to
  potential data breaches and compliance violations with security standards like ISO
  27001 and SOC 2.
