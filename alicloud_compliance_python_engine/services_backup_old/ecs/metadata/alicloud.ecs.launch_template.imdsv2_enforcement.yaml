title: Elastic Compute Service launch templates should enforce IMDSv2 for instance
  metadata access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch_template has imdsv2 enforcement
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Launch templates must enforce Instance Metadata Service version 2 (IMDSv2)
  to prevent unauthorized metadata access through SSRF attacks and improve security
  posture. IMDSv1 is vulnerable to credential theft and privilege escalation attacks,
  while IMDSv2 requires session tokens and provides enhanced security controls. This
  enforcement ensures all instances launched from the template maintain secure metadata
  access patterns required for compliance frameworks.
