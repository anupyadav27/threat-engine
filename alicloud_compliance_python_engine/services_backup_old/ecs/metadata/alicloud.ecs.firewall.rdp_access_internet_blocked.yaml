title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block RDP Access from Internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service firewall has rdp access internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) security groups do not allow
  inbound RDP (port 3389) access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted RDP access
  exposes Windows instances to brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.
  This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks that require restricted
  administrative access to cloud resources.
