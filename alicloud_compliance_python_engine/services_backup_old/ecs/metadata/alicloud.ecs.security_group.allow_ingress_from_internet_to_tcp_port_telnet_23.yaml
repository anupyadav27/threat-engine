title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To TCP Port 23 (Telnet)
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port telnet 23 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  inbound traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 23 (Telnet). Telnet transmits
  data in plain text without encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and
  man-in-the-middle attacks. Allowing unrestricted internet access to Telnet services
  violates security compliance frameworks and significantly increases the risk of
  unauthorized access and credential theft.
