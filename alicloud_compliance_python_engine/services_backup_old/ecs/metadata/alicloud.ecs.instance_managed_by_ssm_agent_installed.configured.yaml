title: Elastic Compute Service instances should have Systems Manager Agent installed
  and configured
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance_managed_by_ssm_agent_installed
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures ECS instances have the SSM Agent properly installed and configured
  to enable secure remote management capabilities. Without SSM Agent, instances cannot
  be managed through Systems Manager, limiting centralized patch management, configuration
  compliance, and secure remote access. This creates security gaps in system maintenance
  and violates infrastructure management best practices.
