title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block Redis port access from internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has redis port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow inbound traffic
  on Redis port 6379 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Exposing Redis ports to the internet
  creates significant security risks including unauthorized data access, data breaches,
  and potential compliance violations. This rule helps maintain secure network configurations
  by restricting Redis database access to trusted networks only.
