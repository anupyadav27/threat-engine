title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service disk default encryption at rest is configured
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk_default_encryption_at_rest_enabled
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that default encryption at rest is properly configured
  for ECS disks to protect data from unauthorized access. Without default encryption
  enabled, sensitive data stored on ECS disks remains vulnerable to data breaches
  and may not meet compliance requirements for data protection standards. Enabling
  default encryption ensures all new disks are automatically encrypted, reducing the
  risk of data exposure.
