title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Restrict Access to Common High-Risk
  Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has common ports access
  restricted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access (0.0.0.0/0) to commonly exploited ports such as SSH (22), RDP (3389),
  FTP (21), Telnet (23), and database ports. Unrestricted access to these ports significantly
  increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access, potentially leading
  to data breaches and compliance violations with security frameworks like ISO 27001
  and SOC 2.
