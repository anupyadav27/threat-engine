title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress to Elasticsearch
  Kibana Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has elasticsearch kibana
  ports public ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public access to Elasticsearch Kibana ports (typically 5601). Exposing Kibana interfaces
  to the internet creates significant security risks including unauthorized data access,
  potential data breaches, and compliance violations. This rule helps maintain proper
  network segmentation and protects sensitive log data from external threats.
