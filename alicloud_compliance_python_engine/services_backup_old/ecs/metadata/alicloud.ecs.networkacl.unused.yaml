rule_id: alicloud.ecs.networkacl.unused
service: ecs
resource: networkacl
requirement: Unused
scope: ecs.networkacl.security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure unused Elastic Compute Service Network ACLs are removed
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has unused properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Unused Network ACLs in ECS environments create unnecessary attack surface
  and complicate security management. These orphaned resources can lead to configuration
  drift, increased operational overhead, and potential security misconfigurations
  that may inadvertently expose resources or violate compliance requirements for resource
  governance.
