service: ecs
resource: instance
requirement: Ssh Key Authentication Mandatory

domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service instances must use SSH key authentication instead of
  password authentication
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has ssh key authentication mandatory
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances are configured to use SSH key pairs
  for authentication rather than password-based authentication. Password authentication
  is vulnerable to brute force attacks and credential theft, while SSH key authentication
  provides stronger cryptographic security. Enforcing SSH key authentication helps
  meet compliance requirements for secure remote access and reduces the risk of unauthorized
  instance access.
