subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Restrict Inbound Traffic Access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm security group inbound
  restricted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances have properly
  configured security groups that restrict inbound network traffic to only necessary
  ports and sources. Overly permissive inbound rules can expose instances to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and compliance violations. Implementing restrictive inbound
  security group rules is essential for maintaining network security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
