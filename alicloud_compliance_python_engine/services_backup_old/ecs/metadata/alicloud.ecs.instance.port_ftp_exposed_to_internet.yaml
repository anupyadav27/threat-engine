rule_id: alicloud.ecs.instance.port_ftp_exposed_to_internet
service: ecs
resource: instance
requirement: Port Ftp Exposed To Internet
scope: ecs.instance.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service instance should not expose FTP port to internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has port ftp exposed to internet
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies ECS instances with FTP port (21) exposed to the
  internet through security group rules. FTP transmits credentials and data in plain
  text, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Exposing FTP
  services publicly violates security compliance frameworks and increases the attack
  surface for potential data breaches.
