subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service Launch Template Root Volume Should Be Encrypted By
  Default
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch_template has root volume encrypted
  by default properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ECS launch templates are configured to encrypt root volumes
  by default to protect sensitive data at rest. Unencrypted root volumes expose system
  files, application data, and potentially sensitive information to unauthorized access
  in case of physical media compromise. This control helps meet compliance requirements
  for data protection standards such as ISO 27001 and local data privacy regulations.
