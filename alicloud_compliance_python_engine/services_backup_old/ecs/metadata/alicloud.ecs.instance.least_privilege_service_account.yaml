scope: ecs.instance.least_privilege
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should use least privilege service accounts
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has least privilege service account
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures ECS instances are configured with service accounts that have
  minimal required permissions rather than excessive privileges. Overprivileged service
  accounts increase the attack surface and potential for lateral movement in case
  of compromise. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks requiring
  principle of least privilege implementation.
