title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances are managed by Systems Manager
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has managed by ssm properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Elastic Compute Service instances should be managed through Systems Manager
  (SSM) to enable centralized configuration management, patch management, and operational
  oversight. Instances not managed by SSM lack automated security updates and compliance
  monitoring capabilities, increasing vulnerability exposure and making it difficult
  to maintain consistent security baselines across the infrastructure.
