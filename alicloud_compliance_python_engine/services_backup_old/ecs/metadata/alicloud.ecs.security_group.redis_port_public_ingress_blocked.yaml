title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  to Redis Port 6379
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has redis port public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public access to Redis port 6379 (TCP). Exposing Redis instances to the internet
  creates significant security risks including unauthorized data access, data breaches,
  and potential service disruption. This control helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks that require database services to be protected from public internet access.
