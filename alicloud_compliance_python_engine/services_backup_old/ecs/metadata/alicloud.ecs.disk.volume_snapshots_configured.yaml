title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service disk volume snapshots are properly configured
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk has volume snapshots configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS disk volumes have snapshot policies configured
  to enable regular backup creation. Without proper snapshot configuration, organizations

  policies.
