title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To TCP Port PostgreSQL 5432
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port postgres 5432 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies ECS security groups that allow unrestricted inbound
  access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 5432, commonly used by PostgreSQL
  databases. Exposing database ports directly to the internet creates significant
  security risks including unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compliance
  violations with data protection regulations.
