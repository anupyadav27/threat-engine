rule_id: alicloud.ecs.public.address_shodan
service: ecs
resource: public
requirement: Address Shodan
scope: ecs.public.security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service instances with public IP addresses should not be exposed
  on Shodan search engine
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service public has address shodan properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies ECS instances with public IP addresses that are
  discoverable through the Shodan search engine, indicating potential security exposure.
  Public-facing services indexed by Shodan can be targeted by attackers for reconnaissance
  and exploitation, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This exposure may violate compliance requirements for data protection and network
  security controls.
