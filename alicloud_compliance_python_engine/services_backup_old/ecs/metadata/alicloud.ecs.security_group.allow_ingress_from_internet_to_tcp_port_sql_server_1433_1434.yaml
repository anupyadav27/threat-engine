title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To SQL Server Ports 1433-1434
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port sql server 1433 1434 properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to SQL Server default
  ports 1433 and 1434. Exposing database ports directly to the internet creates significant
  security risks including unauthorized data access, SQL injection attacks, and potential
  data breaches. This configuration violates security best practices and may impact
  compliance with data protection regulations.
