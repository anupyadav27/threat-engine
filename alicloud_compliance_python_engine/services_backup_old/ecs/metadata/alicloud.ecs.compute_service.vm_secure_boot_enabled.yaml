rule_id: alicloud.ecs.compute_service.vm_secure_boot_enabled
service: ecs
resource: compute_service
requirement: Vm Secure Boot Enabled
scope: ecs.compute_service.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances have Secure Boot enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm secure boot enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are configured with Secure Boot
  functionality enabled to protect against boot-level malware and unauthorized firmware
  modifications. Secure Boot helps maintain system integrity by validating digital
  signatures of boot components, reducing risks of rootkits and boot sector attacks.
  Non-compliance may expose instances to advanced persistent threats and fail security
  compliance requirements.
