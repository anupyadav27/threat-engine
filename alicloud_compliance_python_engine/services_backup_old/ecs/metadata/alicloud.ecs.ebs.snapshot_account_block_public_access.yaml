subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service Elastic Block Storage snapshots should have account-level
  public access blocking enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ebs has snapshot account block public access
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS EBS snapshots have account-level public access
  blocking configured to prevent unauthorized access to snapshot data. Public snapshots
  can expose sensitive data and violate data privacy regulations, potentially leading
  to data breaches and compliance violations. Enabling account-level blocking provides
  an additional security layer against accidental public exposure of snapshot contents.
