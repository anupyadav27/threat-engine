resource: e_hpc
requirement: Training Job VPC Configured
scope: ecs.e_hpc.security

subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Elastic High Performance Computing Training Jobs are Configured with
  VPC
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service e_hpc has training job vpc configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Elastic High Performance Computing (E-HPC) training
  jobs are properly configured to run within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Training
  jobs without VPC configuration may expose sensitive computational data and models
  to unauthorized network access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. Proper VPC configuration ensures network isolation and controlled access
  to training resources.
