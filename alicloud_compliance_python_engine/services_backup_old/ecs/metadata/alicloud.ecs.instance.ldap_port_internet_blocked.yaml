title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block LDAP port access from internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has ldap port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances do not
  allow inbound traffic on LDAP ports (389, 636) from the internet through security
  group configurations. Exposing LDAP services to the internet increases the risk
  of unauthorized directory access, credential theft, and potential data breaches.
  Proper network segmentation helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and
  reduces attack surface.
