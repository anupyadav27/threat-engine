resource: instance
requirement: Security Hardening Applied
scope: ecs.instance.hardening
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: os_hardening
severity: low
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances have security hardening configurations
  applied
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has security hardening applied
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that ECS instances implement essential security hardening measures
  including secure boot configurations, system-level security controls, and baseline
  security settings. Instances without proper security hardening are vulnerable to
  privilege escalation attacks, malware persistence, and may fail compliance requirements
  for data protection standards.
