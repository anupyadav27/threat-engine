title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  to FTP Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has ftp ports public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access to FTP ports (20, 21) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Public access
  to FTP ports exposes systems to brute force attacks, data interception, and unauthorized
  file transfers, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations with
  security frameworks.
