rule_id: alicloud.cfw.network.firewall_logging_enabled
service: cfw
resource: network
requirement: Firewall Logging Enabled
scope: cfw.network.logging
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: firewall_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud Cloud Firewall Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures CFW network has firewall logging enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for AliCloud Cloud Firewall
  to capture network traffic and security events. Without proper firewall logging,
  organizations cannot monitor security incidents, investigate breaches, or maintain
  audit trails required for compliance frameworks. Disabled logging creates blind
  spots in network security monitoring and prevents effective incident response.
