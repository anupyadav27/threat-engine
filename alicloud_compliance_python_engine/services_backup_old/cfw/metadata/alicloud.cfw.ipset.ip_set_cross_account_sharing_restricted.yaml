subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: low
title: Ensure Cloud Firewall IP Set Cross-Account Sharing is Restricted
rationale: Ensures CFW ipset has ip set cross account sharing restricted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Cloud Firewall IP sets are not shared across
  multiple AliCloud accounts without proper restrictions. Unrestricted cross-account
  sharing of IP sets can lead to unauthorized access to network security configurations
  and potential security policy bypasses. Proper access controls help maintain network
  segmentation and comply with security governance requirements.
