title: Cloud Firewall WAF IP Set Storage Should Be Encrypted
rationale: Ensures CFW waf_ip_sets has ip set storage encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Cloud Firewall WAF IP set storage is encrypted to protect
  sensitive IP address lists and security rules from unauthorized access. Unencrypted
  IP set storage can expose critical network security configurations and potentially
  compromise firewall effectiveness. This control helps maintain data confidentiality
  and supports compliance with data protection regulations.
