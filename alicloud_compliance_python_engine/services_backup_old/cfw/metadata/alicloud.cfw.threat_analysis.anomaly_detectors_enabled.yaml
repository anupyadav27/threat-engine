subcategory: security_monitoring

title: Ensure AliCloud Cloud Firewall Threat Analysis Anomaly Detectors Are Enabled
rationale: Ensures CFW threat_analysis has anomaly detectors enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that anomaly detection capabilities are enabled within
  AliCloud Cloud Firewall's threat analysis module. Disabled anomaly detectors can
  leave organizations vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, zero-day threats, and abnormal
  network behaviors that signature-based detection might miss. Enabling these detectors
  is essential for maintaining comprehensive security monitoring and meeting advanced
  threat detection compliance requirements.
