  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule validates that IP sets configured in AliCloud Cloud Firewall's
  Web Application Firewall contain only trusted source IP addresses or networks. Untrusted
  IP sources in WAF IP sets can lead to unauthorized access, security policy bypass,
  and potential data breaches. Proper IP set management is essential for maintaining
  network security boundaries and compliance with access control requirements.
