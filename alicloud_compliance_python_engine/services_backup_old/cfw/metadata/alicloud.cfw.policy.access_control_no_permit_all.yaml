title: Cloud Firewall Access Control Policies Should Not Allow All Traffic
rationale: Ensures CFW policy has access control no permit all properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Cloud Firewall access control policies do not contain overly
  permissive rules that allow all traffic from any source to any destination. Permit-all
  rules create significant security vulnerabilities by bypassing firewall protections
  and can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations with
  security frameworks requiring network segmentation.
