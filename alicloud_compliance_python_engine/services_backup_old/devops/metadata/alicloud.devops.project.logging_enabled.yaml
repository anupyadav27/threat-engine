title: AliCloud DevOps Project Should Have Logging Enabled
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has logging enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud DevOps projects have logging functionality enabled
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of development and deployment activities.
  Without proper logging, organizations cannot effectively monitor code changes, track
  deployment events, or investigate security incidents, which may lead to compliance
  violations and reduced visibility into potential security threats. This control
  is essential for maintaining accountability and supporting forensic analysis in
  DevOps environments.
