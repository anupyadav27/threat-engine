title: AliCloud DevOps Project Source Repository URLs Must Not Contain Sensitive Credentials
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has source repo url no sensitive credentials properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud DevOps project source repository URLs do not contain

  and potential data breaches. This violates security best practices and compliance
  requirements for credential management.
