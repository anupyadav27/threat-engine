title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Service Network Flow Logs Are Enabled
rationale: Ensures CMS network has monitoring flow logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that network flow logs are enabled in AliCloud CloudMonitor
  Service to capture and monitor network traffic patterns. Without flow logs enabled,
  organizations lose critical visibility into network communications, making it difficult
  to detect suspicious activities, investigate security incidents, or meet compliance
  requirements for network monitoring and audit trails.
