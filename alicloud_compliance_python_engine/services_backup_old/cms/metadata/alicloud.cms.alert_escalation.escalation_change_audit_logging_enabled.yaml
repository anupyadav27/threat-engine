rule_id: alicloud.cms.alert_escalation.escalation_change_audit_logging_enabled
service: cms
resource: alert_escalation
requirement: Escalation Change Audit Logging Enabled
scope: cms.alert_escalation.logging
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure CloudMonitor Alert Escalation Change Audit Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures CMS alert_escalation has escalation change audit logging enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for changes made to
  CloudMonitor alert escalation configurations. Without proper audit logging, unauthorized
  modifications to critical alert escalation policies may go undetected, potentially
  compromising incident response capabilities and regulatory compliance requirements.
  Enabling escalation change audit logging provides essential visibility into who
  modified alert configurations and when these changes occurred.
