title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Service Anomaly Detectors Are Enabled
rationale: Ensures CMS anomaly_detection has anomaly detectors enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that anomaly detection capabilities are enabled within
  AliCloud CloudMonitor Service to automatically identify unusual patterns and potential
  security threats in system metrics and application behavior. Disabled anomaly detectors
  can result in delayed incident response, missed security breaches, and non-compliance
  with monitoring requirements that mandate proactive threat detection. Organizations
  without proper anomaly detection may fail to meet regulatory standards for continuous
  security monitoring and risk management.
