title: Ensure CloudMonitor Change Detection Alarms are Configured for Route Tables
rationale: Ensures CMS route_tables has change detection alarm configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Route table modifications can significantly impact network traffic flow
  and security posture by potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access or
  creating network segmentation bypasses. Configuring CloudMonitor change detection
  alarms for route tables ensures immediate notification of unauthorized or unexpected
  routing changes, enabling rapid incident response and maintaining network security
  compliance requirements.
