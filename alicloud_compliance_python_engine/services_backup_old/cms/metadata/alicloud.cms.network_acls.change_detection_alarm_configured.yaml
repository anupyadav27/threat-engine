title: Ensure CloudMonitor Change Detection Alarms are Configured for Network Access
  Control Lists
rationale: Ensures CMS network_acls has change detection alarm configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor alarms are properly configured to
  detect unauthorized changes to Network Access Control Lists (ACLs). Without proper
  monitoring, malicious modifications to network ACL rules could go undetected, potentially
  exposing resources to unauthorized access or creating security vulnerabilities.
  Implementing change detection alarms helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  and enables rapid incident response.
