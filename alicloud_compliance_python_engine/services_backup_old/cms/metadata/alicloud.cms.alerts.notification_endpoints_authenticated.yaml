rationale: Ensures CMS alerts has notification endpoints authenticated properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service alert notification endpoints
  are properly authenticated to prevent unauthorized access to monitoring alerts.

  and allow malicious actors to intercept or manipulate alert notifications. Proper

  monitoring infrastructure from unauthorized access.
