service: cms
resource: log
requirement: Metric Filter Sign In Without MFA
scope: cms.log.authentication
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: multi_factor_authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service has metric filter for sign-in events without multi-factor
  authentication
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter sign in without mfa properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service has proper metric filters
  configured to detect and alert on user sign-in events that occur without multi-factor
  authentication (MFA). Sign-in events without MFA pose significant security risks
  as they indicate potential unauthorized access attempts or weak authentication practices.
  Implementing this monitoring helps organizations maintain compliance with security
  frameworks and enables rapid detection of suspicious authentication activities.
