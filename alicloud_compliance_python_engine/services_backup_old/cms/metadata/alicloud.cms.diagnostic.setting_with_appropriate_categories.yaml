  log categories to ensure proper security monitoring and audit trail coverage. Inadequate
  diagnostic category configuration can result in blind spots for security incident
  detection, compliance violations, and insufficient forensic capabilities during
  security investigations. This misconfiguration may lead to non-compliance with regulatory
  frameworks that require comprehensive logging and monitoring.
