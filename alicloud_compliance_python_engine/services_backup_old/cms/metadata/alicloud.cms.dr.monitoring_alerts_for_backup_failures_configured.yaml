subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: medium
title: Ensure CloudMonitor Alerts Are Configured for Disaster Recovery Backup Failures
rationale: Ensures CMS dr has monitoring alerts for backup failures configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor alerts are properly configured to
  detect and notify on backup failures in disaster recovery scenarios. Without proper
  monitoring alerts, backup failures may go unnoticed, leading to data loss risks
  and potential compliance violations. Timely notification of backup failures is critical
  for maintaining business continuity and meeting regulatory requirements for data
  protection.
