title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Log Groups Have KMS Encryption Enabled
rationale: Ensures CMS log_group has kms encryption active properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: CloudMonitor Service log groups should have KMS encryption enabled to
  protect sensitive monitoring data at rest. Without KMS encryption, log data containing
  system metrics, alerts, and operational information remains vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and may not meet compliance requirements for data protection standards. This
  security control ensures that all log data is encrypted using customer-managed or
  service-managed KMS keys.
