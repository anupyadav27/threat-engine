title: Ensure CloudMonitor Alerts Are Configured for Disaster Recovery Replication
  Lag
rationale: Ensures CMS dr has monitoring alerts for replication lag configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor alerts are properly configured to
  detect replication lag in disaster recovery scenarios. Without proper monitoring
  of replication lag, organizations may experience data loss during failover events
  and fail to meet recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
  Inadequate replication monitoring can lead to compliance violations and business
  continuity failures.
