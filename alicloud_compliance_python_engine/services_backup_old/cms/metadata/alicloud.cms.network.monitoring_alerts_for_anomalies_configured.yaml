title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Network Anomaly Detection Alerts Are Properly Configured
rationale: Ensures CMS network has monitoring alerts for anomalies configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service has appropriate alerting
  mechanisms configured to detect and notify administrators of network anomalies and
  suspicious activities. Proper network monitoring alerts are essential for early
  detection of security incidents, DDoS attacks, and unauthorized network access attempts.
  Without configured anomaly detection alerts, organizations may fail to meet compliance
  requirements and miss critical security events that could lead to data breaches
  or service disruptions.
