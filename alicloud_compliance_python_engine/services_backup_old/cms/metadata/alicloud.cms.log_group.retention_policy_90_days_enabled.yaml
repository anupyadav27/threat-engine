title: CloudMonitor Service Log Group Should Have 90-Day Retention Policy Enabled
rationale: Ensures CMS log_group has retention policy 90 days enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures CloudMonitor Service log groups maintain logs for at least 90
  days to support security investigations and compliance requirements. Insufficient
  log retention periods can hinder incident response capabilities and violate regulatory
  compliance standards that require extended audit trails. Proper log retention is
  essential for forensic analysis and meeting data governance obligations.
