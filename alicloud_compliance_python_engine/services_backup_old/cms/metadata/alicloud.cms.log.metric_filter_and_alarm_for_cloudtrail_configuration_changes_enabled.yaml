title: Ensure Cloud Monitor Service Has Metric Filter and Alarm for ActionTrail Configuration
  Changes
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter and alarm for cloudtrail configuration
  changes enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Cloud Monitor Service has proper metric filters
  and alarms configured to detect ActionTrail configuration changes. Without these
  monitoring controls, unauthorized modifications to audit logging configurations
  could go undetected, potentially allowing attackers to disable logging before performing
  malicious activities. This monitoring is essential for maintaining audit trail integrity
  and meeting compliance requirements for security event detection.
