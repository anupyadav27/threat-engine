title: AliCloud CloudMonitor Alert Rules Must Have Notification Destinations Configured
rationale: Ensures CMS alerts has notification destinations configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that CloudMonitor alert rules have proper notification destinations
  configured to enable timely incident response. Alert rules without notification
  destinations create security blind spots where critical system events, security
  incidents, or performance anomalies may go unnoticed, potentially leading to prolonged
  security breaches or compliance violations. Proper notification configuration is
  essential for maintaining security monitoring effectiveness and meeting regulatory
  requirements for incident detection and response.
