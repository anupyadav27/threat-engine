title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Log Metric Filter Policy Changes Are Monitored
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter policy changes properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule monitors changes to metric filter policies in AliCloud CloudMonitor
  Service logs to detect unauthorized modifications to monitoring configurations.
  Unmonitored policy changes can lead to security blind spots, allowing malicious
  activities to go undetected and potentially compromising compliance with security
  monitoring requirements. Proper monitoring of these changes ensures continuous visibility
  into system security posture.
