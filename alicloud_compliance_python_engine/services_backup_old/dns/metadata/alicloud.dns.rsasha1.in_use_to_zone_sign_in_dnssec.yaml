title: Alibaba Cloud DNS should not use RSA-SHA1 algorithm for DNSSEC zone signing
rationale: Ensures DNS rsasha1 has in use to zone sign in dnssec properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies DNS zones using the deprecated RSA-SHA1 algorithm
  for DNSSEC signing, which poses significant security risks due to cryptographic
  weaknesses. RSA-SHA1 is vulnerable to collision attacks and does not meet current
  security standards, potentially compromising DNS integrity and authenticity. Organizations
  should migrate to stronger algorithms like RSA-SHA256 or ECDSA to maintain compliance
  with modern cryptographic standards.
