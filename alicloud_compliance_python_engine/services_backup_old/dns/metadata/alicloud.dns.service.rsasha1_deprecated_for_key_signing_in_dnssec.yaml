service: dns
resource: service
requirement: Rsasha1 Deprecated For Key Signing In Dnssec
scope: dns.service.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: key_management
severity: high
title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud DNS Service Does Not Use Deprecated RSA-SHA1 Algorithm
  for DNSSEC Key Signing
rationale: Ensures DNS service has rsasha1 deprecated for key signing in dnssec properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Alibaba Cloud DNS Service implementations do
  not use the deprecated RSA-SHA1 algorithm for DNSSEC key signing operations. Using
  RSA-SHA1 for DNSSEC key signing poses significant security risks due to known cryptographic
  vulnerabilities and may result in DNS resolution failures as major resolvers reject
  RSA-SHA1 signed responses. Organizations should migrate to stronger algorithms like
  RSA-SHA256 or ECDSA to maintain DNS security and ensure compliance with modern cryptographic
  standards.
