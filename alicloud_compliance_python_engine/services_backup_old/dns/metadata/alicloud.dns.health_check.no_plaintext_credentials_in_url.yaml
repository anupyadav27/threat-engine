title: Alibaba Cloud DNS Health Check URLs Should Not Contain Plaintext Credentials
rationale: Ensures DNS health_check has no plaintext credentials in url properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DNS health check URLs do not contain plaintext credentials
  such as usernames, passwords, or API keys in the URL parameters or path. Exposing
  credentials in URLs creates significant security risks as they may be logged in
  web server logs, browser history, or network monitoring tools, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access and compliance violations.
