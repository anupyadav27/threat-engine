title: Auto Scaling Group Should Have Capacity Rebalance Enabled
rationale: Ensures ESS group has capacity rebalance enforced properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Auto Scaling groups have capacity rebalance enabled
  to automatically redistribute instances across Availability Zones when Spot Instance
  interruption notices are received. Without capacity rebalance, applications may
  experience service disruptions and reduced availability during Spot Instance interruptions,
  potentially violating SLA requirements and business continuity policies.
