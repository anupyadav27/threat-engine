title: Alibaba Cloud API Gateway REST API Cache Encryption At Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures APIGATEWAY restapi has cache encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that API Gateway REST API cache data is encrypted at
  rest to protect sensitive cached responses from unauthorized access. Unencrypted
  cache data poses significant security risks including data breaches and potential
  compliance violations with data protection regulations. Enabling encryption at rest
  helps maintain data confidentiality and meets security compliance requirements.
