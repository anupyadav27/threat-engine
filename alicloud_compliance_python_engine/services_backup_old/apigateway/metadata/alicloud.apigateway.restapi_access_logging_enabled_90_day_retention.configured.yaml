title: API Gateway REST API access logging should be enabled with 90-day retention
  period
rationale: Ensures APIGATEWAY restapi_access_logging_enabled_90_day_retention has
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that API Gateway REST APIs have access logging enabled with a
  minimum 90-day log retention period for comprehensive audit trails. Without proper
  access logging and retention, organizations cannot effectively monitor API usage
  patterns, detect security incidents, or meet compliance requirements for data access
  tracking. This configuration is essential for forensic analysis and regulatory compliance
  frameworks that mandate extended log retention periods.
