severity: medium
title: ApsaraDB for RDS Instance IAM or Managed Identity Authentication Should Be
  Enabled Where Supported
rationale: Ensures APSARADB rds_instance has instance iam or managed identity auth
  enabled where supported properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for RDS instances utilize IAM authentication or
  managed identity authentication mechanisms where supported by the database engine.
  This reduces reliance on traditional password-based authentication, minimizing credential
  exposure risks and improving access control through centralized identity management.
  Enabling IAM authentication helps meet compliance requirements for secure database
  access and reduces the attack surface for credential-based threats.
