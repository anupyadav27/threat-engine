title: ApsaraDB RDS Instance Should Have Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures APSARADB instance has at rest enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ApsaraDB RDS instances have encryption at rest
  enabled to protect sensitive data stored in databases. Without encryption at rest,
  database files, backups, and snapshots remain vulnerable to unauthorized access
  and data breaches. Enabling encryption at rest is essential for compliance with
  data protection regulations and security best practices.
