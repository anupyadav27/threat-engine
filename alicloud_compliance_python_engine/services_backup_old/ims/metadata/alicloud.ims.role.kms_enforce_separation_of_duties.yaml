subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Identity and Access Management (IMS) roles should enforce separation of duties
  for Key Management Service (KMS) operations
rationale: Ensures IMS role has kms enforce separation of duties properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that IMS roles implement proper separation of duties
  for KMS operations by preventing a single role from having both administrative and
  operational KMS permissions. Roles with excessive KMS privileges can lead to unauthorized
  key access, data breaches, and compliance violations with security frameworks requiring
  segregation of cryptographic duties. Proper separation reduces the risk of insider
  threats and accidental key compromise.
