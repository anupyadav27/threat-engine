title: Ensure AliCloud Identity Management Service Asset Inventory is Enabled
rationale: Ensures IMS cloud has asset inventory enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Asset Inventory is enabled in AliCloud Identity
  Management Service to maintain comprehensive visibility of cloud resources and identities.
  Without proper asset inventory, organizations face increased security risks from
  untracked resources, compliance violations, and inability to detect unauthorized
  access or resource modifications. Enabling asset inventory is essential for security
  monitoring, compliance auditing, and incident response capabilities.
