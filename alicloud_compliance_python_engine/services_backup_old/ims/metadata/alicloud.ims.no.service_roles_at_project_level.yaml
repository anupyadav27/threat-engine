service: ims

requirement: Service Roles At Project Level
scope: ims.no.security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Identity Management Service (IMS) Service Roles Are Not Assigned at
  Project Level
rationale: Ensures IMS no has service roles at project level properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that service roles within AliCloud Identity Management
  Service are not granted excessive permissions at the project level. Overly broad
  service role assignments can lead to privilege escalation risks and violate the
  principle of least privilege. Proper role scoping is essential for maintaining security
  boundaries and meeting compliance requirements for access control.
