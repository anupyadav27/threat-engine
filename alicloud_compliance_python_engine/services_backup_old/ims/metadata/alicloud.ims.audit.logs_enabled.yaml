title: Identity Management Service (IMS) Audit Logging Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures IMS audit has logs enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that audit logging is enabled for Identity Management Service
  (IMS) to track identity-related operations and access events. Without proper audit
  logging, organizations cannot detect unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalations,
  or compliance violations. This control is essential for meeting security compliance
  requirements and maintaining visibility into identity management activities.
