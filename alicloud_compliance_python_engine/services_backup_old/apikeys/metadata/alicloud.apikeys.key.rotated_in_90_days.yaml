title: AliCloud API Keys should be rotated within 90 days
rationale: Ensures APIKEYS key has rotated in 90 days properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: API keys that remain unchanged for extended periods increase security
  risks through potential exposure and compromise. Regular rotation of API keys within
  90 days reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access and helps maintain
  compliance with security best practices. Stale API keys pose significant risks to
  cloud resource security and data protection.
