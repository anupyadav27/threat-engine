service: function
resource: compute_function
requirement: Function Logging And Tracing Enabled
scope: function.compute_function.logging
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud Function Compute Functions Have Logging and Tracing Enabled
rationale: Ensures FUNCTION compute_function has function logging and tracing enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Function Compute functions have proper logging
  and tracing configurations enabled to maintain audit trails and observability. Without
  adequate logging and tracing, security incidents may go undetected, and compliance
  requirements for audit trails cannot be met. Proper monitoring is essential for
  detecting anomalous function behavior and maintaining security posture.
