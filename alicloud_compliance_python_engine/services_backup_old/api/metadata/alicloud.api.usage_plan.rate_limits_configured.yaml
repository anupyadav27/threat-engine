  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that API Gateway usage plans have proper rate limiting configured
  to prevent API abuse and denial of service attacks. Without rate limits, APIs are
  vulnerable to excessive requests that can lead to service degradation, increased
  costs, and potential security breaches. This control is essential for maintaining
  API availability and meeting compliance requirements for access control.
