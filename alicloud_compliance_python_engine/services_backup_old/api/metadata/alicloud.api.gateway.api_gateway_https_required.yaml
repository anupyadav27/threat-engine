title: AliCloud API Gateway HTTPS Protocol Enforcement Required
rationale: Ensures API gateway has api gateway https required properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud API Gateway instances are configured to require
  HTTPS connections for all API endpoints. Without HTTPS enforcement, API communications
  are transmitted in plain text, exposing sensitive data to interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This requirement is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and
  meeting compliance standards for secure API communications.
