title: AliCloud API Gateway Endpoint Authentication Required
rationale: Ensures API api has endpoint authn required properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that API Gateway endpoints have authentication mechanisms enabled
  to prevent unauthorized access to backend services. Unauthenticated endpoints expose
  APIs to potential abuse, data breaches, and compliance violations. This control
  helps maintain proper access controls and meets security framework requirements
  for authenticated API access.
