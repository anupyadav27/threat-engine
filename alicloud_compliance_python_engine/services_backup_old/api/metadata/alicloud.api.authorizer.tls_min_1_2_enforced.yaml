resource: authorizer
requirement: TLS Min 1 2 Enforced
scope: api.authorizer.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_in_transit
severity: medium
title: API Gateway Authorizer Must Enforce TLS Version 1.2 or Higher
rationale: Ensures API authorizer has tls min 1 2 enforced properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that API Gateway authorizers are configured to enforce TLS version
  1.2 or higher for secure communication. Using outdated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1)
  exposes API endpoints to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This requirement is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and
  meeting compliance standards for secure API communications.
