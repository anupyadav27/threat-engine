title: Ensure DataWorks Job Scripts Are Stored in Private and Encrypted Locations
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS job has script location private and encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks job scripts are stored in private,
  encrypted storage locations to protect sensitive data processing logic and prevent
  unauthorized access. Unencrypted or publicly accessible scripts can expose business
  logic, data transformation rules, and potentially sensitive credentials, leading
  to data breaches and compliance violations. Proper script storage encryption and
  access controls are essential for maintaining data security and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
