rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS database has policy least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks database access policies are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to prevent unauthorized data access and privilege
  escalation. Overly permissive database policies can lead to data breaches, compliance
  violations, and unauthorized modifications to sensitive datasets. Implementing least
  privilege access controls is essential for maintaining data security and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
