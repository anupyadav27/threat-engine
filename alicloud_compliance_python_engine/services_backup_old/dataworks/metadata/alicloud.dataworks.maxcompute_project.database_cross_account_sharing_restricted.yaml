resource: maxcompute_project
requirement: Database Cross Account Sharing Restricted
scope: dataworks.maxcompute_project.security
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: low
title: Ensure DataWorks MaxCompute Project Database Cross Account Sharing is Restricted
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS maxcompute_project has database cross account sharing
  restricted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that MaxCompute project databases within DataWorks
  do not allow unrestricted cross-account sharing, which could lead to unauthorized
  data access and potential data breaches. Unrestricted cross-account sharing violates
  data governance principles and may result in compliance violations with data protection
  regulations. Proper access controls should be implemented to ensure data is only
  shared with authorized accounts and users.
