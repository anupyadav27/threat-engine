title: DataWorks Job Should Follow Role Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS job has role least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures DataWorks jobs are configured with minimal required permissions
  to reduce security risks and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Excessive
  permissions can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation attacks, and compliance
  violations with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege access
  controls helps maintain data governance and reduces the attack surface.
