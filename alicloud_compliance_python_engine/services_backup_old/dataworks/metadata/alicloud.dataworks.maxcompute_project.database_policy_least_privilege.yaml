title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks MaxCompute Project Database Policies Follow Least
  Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS maxcompute_project has database policy least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that MaxCompute project database policies are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to prevent unauthorized data access and privilege
  escalation. Overprivileged database policies can lead to data breaches, compliance
  violations, and unauthorized operations on sensitive datasets. Implementing least
  privilege access controls is essential for maintaining data security and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
