title: AliCloud DataWorks Schedule Trigger Logs Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS schedule_trigger has trigger logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that logging is enabled for DataWorks schedule triggers to maintain
  proper audit trails and monitoring capabilities. Without trigger logs enabled, organizations
  cannot track trigger execution history, troubleshoot failures, or maintain compliance
  with security monitoring requirements. This creates blind spots in data pipeline
  operations and hampers incident response capabilities.
