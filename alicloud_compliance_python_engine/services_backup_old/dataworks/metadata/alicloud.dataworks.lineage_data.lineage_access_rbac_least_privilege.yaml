subcategory: least_privilege

title: DataWorks Lineage Data Access Should Follow RBAC Least Privilege Principles
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS lineage_data has lineage access rbac least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks lineage data access permissions are configured
  with role-based access control (RBAC) following least privilege principles. Excessive
  permissions to data lineage information can expose sensitive data relationships
  and processing flows, potentially leading to unauthorized data discovery and compliance
  violations. Proper RBAC implementation helps maintain data governance and reduces
  the risk of insider threats.
