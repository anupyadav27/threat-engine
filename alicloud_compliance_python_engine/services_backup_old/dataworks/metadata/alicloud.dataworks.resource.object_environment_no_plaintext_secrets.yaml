title: AliCloud DataWorks Resource Object Environment Should Not Contain Plaintext
  Secrets
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS resource has object environment no plaintext secrets
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks resource object environments do not store sensitive
  information such as passwords, API keys, or tokens in plaintext format. Plaintext
  secrets in environment configurations pose significant security risks including
  unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection
  regulations. This control helps maintain secure credential management practices
  within DataWorks workflows.
