title: DataWorks Schema Should Implement RBAC Least Privilege Access Controls
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS schema has rbac least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures DataWorks schema access follows role-based access control (RBAC)
  least privilege principles to minimize security risks. Excessive permissions on
  data schemas can lead to unauthorized data access, data breaches, and compliance
  violations. Proper RBAC implementation restricts users to only the minimum permissions
  necessary for their job functions.
