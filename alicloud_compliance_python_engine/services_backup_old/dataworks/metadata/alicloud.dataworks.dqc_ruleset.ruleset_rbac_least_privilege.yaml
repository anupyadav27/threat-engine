title: DataWorks Data Quality Center Ruleset RBAC Least Privilege Access Control
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_ruleset has ruleset rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures DataWorks Data Quality Center rulesets implement role-based access
  control with least privilege principles to prevent unauthorized access to data quality
  rules and configurations. Excessive permissions on DQC rulesets can lead to unauthorized
  data quality rule modifications, compliance violations, and potential data governance
  breaches.
