service: dataworks
resource: metadata_registry
requirement: Registry RBAC Least Privilege
scope: dataworks.metadata_registry.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Ensure DataWorks Metadata Registry implements RBAC least privilege access controls
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata_registry has registry rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Metadata Registry follows the principle
  of least privilege in its Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration. Excessive
  permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, data lineage
  information, and potential data breaches. Proper RBAC implementation is essential
  for compliance with data governance frameworks and regulatory requirements.
