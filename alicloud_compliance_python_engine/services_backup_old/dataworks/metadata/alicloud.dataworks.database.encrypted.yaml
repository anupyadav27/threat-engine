title: Ensure DataWorks database connections are encrypted
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS database has encrypted properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks database connections must use encryption to protect sensitive
  data in transit between DataWorks and connected databases. Unencrypted database
  connections expose data to potential interception and man-in-the-middle attacks,
  violating data protection compliance requirements. This control ensures all database
  communications are secured through SSL/TLS encryption.
