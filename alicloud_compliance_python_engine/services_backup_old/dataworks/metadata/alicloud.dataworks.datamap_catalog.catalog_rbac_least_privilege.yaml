title: DataWorks DataMap Catalog RBAC Least Privilege Access Control
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_catalog has catalog rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures DataWorks DataMap catalog implements role-based access control
  with least privilege principles to prevent unauthorized data discovery and metadata
  exposure. Excessive permissions on data catalogs can lead to sensitive data leakage
  and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper RBAC configuration
  minimizes the attack surface and ensures users only access necessary catalog resources.
