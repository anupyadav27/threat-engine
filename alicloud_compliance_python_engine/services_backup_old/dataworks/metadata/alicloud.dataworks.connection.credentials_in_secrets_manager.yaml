title: Ensure DataWorks connections store credentials in Secrets Manager
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS connection has credentials in secrets manager properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks connections should use AliCloud Secrets Manager to securely
  store database credentials and API keys rather than embedding them in plain text.
  This prevents credential exposure in logs, configuration files, and reduces the
  risk of unauthorized access to connected data sources. Proper credential management
  is essential for compliance with data protection regulations and enterprise security
  policies.
