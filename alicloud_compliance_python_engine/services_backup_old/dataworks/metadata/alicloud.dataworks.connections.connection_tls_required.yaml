title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Data Source Connections Require TLS Encryption
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS connections has connection tls required properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all DataWorks data source connections are configured
  to use TLS encryption for data transmission. Unencrypted connections expose sensitive
  data to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks during data integration processes.
  Enforcing TLS encryption helps maintain data confidentiality and supports compliance
  with data protection regulations.
