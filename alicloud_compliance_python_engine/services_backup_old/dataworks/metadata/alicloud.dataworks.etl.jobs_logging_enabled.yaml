subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks ETL Jobs Have Logging Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS etl has jobs logging enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for DataWorks ETL jobs to
  ensure proper audit trails and operational visibility. Without logging enabled,
  organizations cannot track job execution details, troubleshoot failures, or maintain
  compliance with security monitoring requirements. Disabled logging creates blind
  spots that can hinder incident response and forensic analysis capabilities.
