title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Resource Object Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS resource has object logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that object logging is enabled for DataWorks resources
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of data operations and access patterns. Without
  proper logging enabled, organizations cannot track data lineage, detect unauthorized
  access, or meet compliance requirements for data governance and security monitoring.
  Enabling object logging is essential for forensic analysis and regulatory compliance
  in data processing environments.
