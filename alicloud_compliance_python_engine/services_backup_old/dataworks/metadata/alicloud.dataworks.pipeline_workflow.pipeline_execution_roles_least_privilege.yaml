title: Ensure DataWorks Pipeline Workflow Execution Roles Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS pipeline_workflow has pipeline execution roles least
  privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that DataWorks pipeline workflow execution roles are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to prevent privilege escalation and unauthorized
  access to sensitive data resources. Overprivileged execution roles can lead to data
  breaches, compliance violations, and potential lateral movement within the cloud
  environment. This control ensures adherence to security frameworks and regulatory
  requirements by enforcing role-based access controls.
