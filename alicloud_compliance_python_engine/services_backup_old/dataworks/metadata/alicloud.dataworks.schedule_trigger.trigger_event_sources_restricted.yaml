title: AliCloud DataWorks Schedule Trigger Event Sources Should Be Restricted
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS schedule_trigger has trigger event sources restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.

  event sources to prevent unauthorized workflow executions. Unrestricted trigger
  event sources can lead to data pipeline manipulation, unauthorized data processing,
  and potential compliance violations in data governance frameworks.
