service: dataworks
resource: workflow
requirement: KMS Encryption Enabled
scope: dataworks.workflow.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure DataWorks workflows have KMS encryption enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow has kms encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks workflows should be encrypted using Key Management Service
  (KMS) to protect sensitive data processing logic and workflow configurations. Without
  KMS encryption, workflow data remains vulnerable to unauthorized access and may
  violate data protection compliance requirements. This control ensures data-at-rest
  protection for workflow definitions and associated metadata.
