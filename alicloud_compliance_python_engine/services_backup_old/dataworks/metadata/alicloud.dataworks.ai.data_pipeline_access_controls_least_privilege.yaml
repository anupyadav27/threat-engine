service: dataworks
resource: ai
requirement: Data Pipeline Access Controls Least Privilege
scope: dataworks.ai.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Ensure DataWorks AI Data Pipeline Access Controls Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS ai has data pipeline access controls least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks AI data pipeline access controls are
  configured with least privilege permissions, ensuring users and roles have only
  the minimum access required for their functions. Excessive permissions in data pipelines
  can lead to unauthorized data access, data breaches, and compliance violations with
  data protection regulations. Proper access control implementation reduces the attack
  surface and limits potential damage from compromised accounts.
