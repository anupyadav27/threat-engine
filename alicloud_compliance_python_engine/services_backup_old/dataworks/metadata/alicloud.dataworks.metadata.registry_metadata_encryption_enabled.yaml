rule_id: alicloud.dataworks.metadata.registry_metadata_encryption_enabled
service: dataworks
resource: metadata
requirement: Registry Metadata Encryption Enabled
scope: dataworks.metadata.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Registry Metadata Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata has registry metadata encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for DataWorks registry
  metadata to protect sensitive data schema information and metadata at rest. Unencrypted
  metadata can expose data lineage, table structures, and business logic to unauthorized
  access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Enabling
  encryption helps meet regulatory requirements and protects intellectual property
  stored in DataWorks metadata repositories.
