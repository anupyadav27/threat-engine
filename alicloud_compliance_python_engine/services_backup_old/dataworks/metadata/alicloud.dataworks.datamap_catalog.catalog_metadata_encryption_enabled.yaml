title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks DataMap Catalog Metadata Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_catalog has catalog metadata encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that catalog metadata encryption is enabled for DataWorks
  DataMap catalogs to protect sensitive data lineage and metadata information at rest.

  and compliance violations with regulations like GDPR and SOX.
