severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Job Roles Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS tasks_jobs has job role least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks job execution roles are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to perform their designated tasks. Excessive
  permissions in job roles can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation
  attacks, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Implementing
  least privilege access controls reduces the attack surface and limits potential
  damage from compromised job executions.
