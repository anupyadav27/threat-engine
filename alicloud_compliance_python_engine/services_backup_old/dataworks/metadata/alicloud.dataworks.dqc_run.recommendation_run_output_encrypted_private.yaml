rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_run has recommendation run output encrypted private
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Data Quality Center recommendation
  run outputs are encrypted and configured with private access controls. Unencrypted
  or publicly accessible recommendation outputs can expose sensitive data quality
  insights, business logic, and potentially regulated data to unauthorized parties.
  Proper encryption and private storage help maintain data confidentiality and support
  compliance with data protection regulations.
