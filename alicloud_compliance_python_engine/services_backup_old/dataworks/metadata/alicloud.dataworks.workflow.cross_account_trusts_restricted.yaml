title: AliCloud DataWorks Workflow Cross Account Trusts Should Be Restricted
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow has cross account trusts restricted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks workflows do not have overly permissive cross-account
  trust relationships that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data processing
  pipelines. Unrestricted cross-account trusts can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
  workflow execution, and compliance violations with data governance requirements.
  This control helps maintain proper access boundaries and reduces the attack surface
  for data processing environments.
