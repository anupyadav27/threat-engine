severity: medium
title: Ensure DataWorks Real-time Compute streams have encryption at rest enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS stream has encrypted at rest properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks Real-time Compute streams should be encrypted at rest to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without encryption
  at rest, streaming data stored in the underlying storage systems remains vulnerable
  to security threats and may not meet regulatory compliance requirements such as
  GDPR or industry-specific data protection standards.
