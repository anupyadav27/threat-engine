title: Ensure DataWorks jobs are configured to use private network access only
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS job has network private only properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks jobs should be restricted to private network access to prevent
  unauthorized external access and data exposure. Public network access increases
  the attack surface and may lead to data breaches or compliance violations with data
  protection regulations. Private network configuration ensures that job execution
  and data processing remain within the secure internal network perimeter.
