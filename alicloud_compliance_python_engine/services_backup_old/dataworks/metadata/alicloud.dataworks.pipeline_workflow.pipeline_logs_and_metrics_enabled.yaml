requirement: Pipeline Logs And Metrics Enabled
scope: dataworks.pipeline_workflow.security
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Pipeline Workflow Has Logs and Metrics Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS pipeline_workflow has pipeline logs and metrics enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging and monitoring are properly configured
  for DataWorks pipeline workflows to ensure comprehensive audit trails and performance
  visibility. Without proper logging and metrics collection, organizations cannot
  effectively monitor data processing activities, detect security incidents, or maintain
  compliance with data governance requirements. This creates blind spots that can
  hide unauthorized data access, processing failures, or performance degradation.
