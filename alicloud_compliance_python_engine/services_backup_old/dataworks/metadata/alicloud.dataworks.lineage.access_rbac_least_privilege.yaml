subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: DataWorks Data Lineage Access Should Follow RBAC Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS lineage has access rbac least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks data lineage access permissions are configured
  according to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) least privilege principles. Excessive
  lineage access permissions can lead to unauthorized data discovery, sensitive data
  exposure, and compliance violations with data governance regulations. Proper RBAC
  implementation limits users to only the minimum lineage visibility required for
  their job functions.
