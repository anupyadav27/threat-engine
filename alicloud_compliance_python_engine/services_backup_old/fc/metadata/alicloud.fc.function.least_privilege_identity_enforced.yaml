service: fc
resource: function
requirement: Least Privilege Identity Enforced
scope: fc.function.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Function Compute Functions Should Enforce Least Privilege Identity Access
rationale: Ensures FC function has least privilege identity enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures Function Compute functions are configured with minimal necessary
  permissions and role-based access controls. Functions with excessive privileges
  can lead to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  Proper identity management reduces the attack surface and helps maintain compliance
  with security frameworks.
