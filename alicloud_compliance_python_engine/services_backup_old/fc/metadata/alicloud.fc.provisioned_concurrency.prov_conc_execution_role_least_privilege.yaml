domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Function Compute Provisioned Concurrency Execution Role Should Follow Least
  Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures FC provisioned_concurrency has prov conc execution role least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Function Compute provisioned concurrency execution roles
  are configured with minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overly
  permissive execution roles can lead to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized
  access to AliCloud resources. This control helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks by enforcing the principle of least privilege for serverless function
  execution.
