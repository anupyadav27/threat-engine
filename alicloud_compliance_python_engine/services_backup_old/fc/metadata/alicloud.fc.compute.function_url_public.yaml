rule_id: alicloud.fc.compute.function_url_public
service: fc
resource: compute
requirement: Function Url Public
scope: fc.compute.public_access
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: AliCloud Function Compute Function URL Should Not Be Publicly Accessible
rationale: Ensures FC compute has function url public properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute functions with publicly accessible URLs expose serverless
  applications to unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Public function
  URLs can lead to data exposure, unauthorized code execution, and increased attack
  surface, violating security compliance requirements and best practices for serverless
  architectures.
