title: Ensure Function Compute Function URL Authentication is Enabled
rationale: Ensures FC compute has function url authentication properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute function URLs should have authentication enabled to
  prevent unauthorized access to serverless functions. Without proper authentication,
  functions may be exposed to anonymous invocation, potentially leading to data breaches,
  resource abuse, and compliance violations. This control ensures that only authenticated
  users can invoke functions through their HTTP endpoints.
