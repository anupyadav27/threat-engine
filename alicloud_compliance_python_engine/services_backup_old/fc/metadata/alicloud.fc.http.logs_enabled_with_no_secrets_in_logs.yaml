title: Function Compute HTTP triggers must have logging enabled without secrets exposed
  in log entries
rationale: Ensures FC http has logs enabled with no secrets in logs properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Function Compute HTTP triggers have proper logging configured
  while preventing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or tokens from
  being written to log files. This reduces security risks from credential exposure
  and helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations by implementing secure
  logging practices.
