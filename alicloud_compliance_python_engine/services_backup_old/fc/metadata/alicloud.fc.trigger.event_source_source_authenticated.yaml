title: Function Compute trigger event source should be authenticated
rationale: Ensures FC trigger has event source source authenticated properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute triggers with unauthenticated event sources can allow
  unauthorized access to serverless functions, potentially leading to data breaches
  or malicious code execution. This configuration violates security best practices
  and may impact compliance with data protection regulations by exposing sensitive
  function logic to public access.
