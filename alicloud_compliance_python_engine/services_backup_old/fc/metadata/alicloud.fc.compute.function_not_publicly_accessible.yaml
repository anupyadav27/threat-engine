rule_id: alicloud.fc.compute.function_not_publicly_accessible
service: fc
resource: compute
requirement: Function Not Publicly Accessible
scope: fc.compute.public_access
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Function Compute functions are not publicly accessible
rationale: Ensures FC compute has function not publicly accessible properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute functions should not be configured with public access
  permissions to prevent unauthorized invocation and potential data exposure. Public
  accessibility can lead to security vulnerabilities, unexpected charges, and compliance
  violations by allowing anonymous users to execute functions without proper authentication
  controls.
