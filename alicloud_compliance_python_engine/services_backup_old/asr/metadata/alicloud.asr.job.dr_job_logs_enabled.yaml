title: Ensure Automatic Speech Recognition disaster recovery job logs are enabled
rationale: Ensures ASR job has dr job logs enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Automatic Speech Recognition
  (ASR) disaster recovery jobs to maintain audit trails and operational visibility.
  Without proper logging, organizations cannot track job execution status, troubleshoot
  failures, or meet compliance requirements for data processing activities. Disabled
  logging creates security blind spots and hampers incident response capabilities
  for speech processing workloads.
