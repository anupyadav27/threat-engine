title: Application Service Recovery disaster recovery plan storage must be encrypted
  and configured as private

  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Service Recovery (ASR) disaster recovery plan
  storage is encrypted and configured with private access controls. Unencrypted or
  publicly accessible DR storage exposes sensitive backup data to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for disaster recovery infrastructure.
