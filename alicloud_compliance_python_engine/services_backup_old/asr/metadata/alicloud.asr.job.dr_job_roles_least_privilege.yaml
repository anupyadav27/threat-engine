title: Ensure AliCloud Application Service Recovery (ASR) disaster recovery job roles
  follow least privilege principle
rationale: Ensures ASR job has dr job roles least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that disaster recovery job roles in ASR are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to perform their designated functions. Excessive
  permissions in DR job roles can lead to unauthorized access to critical recovery
  operations and sensitive data during disaster scenarios. Proper role configuration
  ensures compliance with security frameworks and reduces the attack surface during
  business continuity operations.
