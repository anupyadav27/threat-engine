title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Auto Scaling Resource (ASR) DR Jobs Use Private Network
  Access Only
rationale: Ensures ASR job has dr job network private only properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that disaster recovery jobs in Auto Scaling Resource
  service are configured to use private network connectivity exclusively. Public network
  access to DR jobs increases attack surface and potential data exposure during backup
  and recovery operations. Restricting network access to private networks helps maintain
  compliance with data protection regulations and reduces security risks.
