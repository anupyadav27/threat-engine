subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Application Service Resilience disaster recovery plans must require approvals
  for changes
rationale: Ensures ASR dr_plan has approvals required for changes properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that disaster recovery plans in Application Service Resilience
  require proper approval workflows before modifications can be implemented. Without
  approval controls, unauthorized changes to DR plans could compromise business continuity
  capabilities and violate change management compliance requirements. This control
  helps maintain the integrity and reliability of disaster recovery procedures.
