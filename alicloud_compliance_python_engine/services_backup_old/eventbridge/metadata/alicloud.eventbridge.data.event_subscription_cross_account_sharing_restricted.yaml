title: Alibaba Cloud EventBridge Event Subscription Cross-Account Sharing Should Be
  Restricted
rationale: Ensures EVENTBRIDGE data has event subscription cross account sharing restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that EventBridge event subscriptions are not configured to allow
  unrestricted cross-account sharing, which could expose sensitive event data to unauthorized
  external accounts. Unrestricted cross-account access increases the risk of data
  leakage and may violate compliance requirements for data isolation and access control.
