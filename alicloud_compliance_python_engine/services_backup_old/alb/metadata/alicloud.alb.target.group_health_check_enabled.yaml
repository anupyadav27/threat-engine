title: Application Load Balancer Target Group Health Check Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures ALB target has group health check enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Load Balancer target groups have health checks
  enabled to automatically detect and route traffic away from unhealthy backend instances.
  Without proper health checks, traffic may be routed to failed or unresponsive targets,
  leading to service degradation and potential security vulnerabilities from compromised
  instances remaining in the load balancer pool. This configuration is essential for
  maintaining high availability and meeting compliance requirements for resilient
  infrastructure.
