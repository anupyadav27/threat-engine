title: Ensure Application Load Balancer Hologres Snapshots Are Encrypted at Rest with
  Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
rationale: Ensures ALB hologres_snapshots has snapshot encrypted at rest cmek properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Hologres database snapshots associated with Application
  Load Balancer configurations are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption
  keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed keys. Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted
  snapshots pose significant data security risks and may violate compliance requirements
  for data protection. Implementing CMEK encryption provides enhanced control over
  encryption keys and helps meet regulatory standards for sensitive data protection.
