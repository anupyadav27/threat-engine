title: Application Load Balancer Target Group Targets Should Be Deployed in Private
  Subnets
rationale: Ensures ALB target_group has tg targets in private subnets properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Load Balancer target group targets are placed
  in private subnets to reduce attack surface and prevent direct internet access to
  backend servers. Targets in public subnets expose applications to unnecessary security
  risks and may violate compliance requirements for network segmentation. This configuration
  helps maintain proper network isolation and defense-in-depth security architecture.
