title: Ensure Application Load Balancer Hologres Snapshots Enable Cross-Region Copy
  Encryption
rationale: Ensures ALB hologres_snapshots has snapshot cross region copy encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Hologres database snapshots configured with Application
  Load Balancer have encryption enabled when copied across regions. Unencrypted cross-region
  snapshot copies expose sensitive data during transit and at rest in the destination
  region, potentially violating data protection regulations and creating security
  vulnerabilities. Enabling encryption ensures data confidentiality and helps maintain
  compliance with security standards.
