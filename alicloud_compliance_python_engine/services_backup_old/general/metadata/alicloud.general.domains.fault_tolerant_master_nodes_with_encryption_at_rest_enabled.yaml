resource: domains
requirement: Fault Tolerant Master Nodes With Encryption At Rest Enabled
scope: general.domains.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud Container Service for Kubernetes Master Nodes Have Fault Tolerance
  and Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL domains has fault tolerant master nodes with encryption
  at rest enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes master nodes are configured with fault
  tolerance capabilities and have encryption at rest enabled for persistent storage.
  Without proper encryption and fault tolerance, master nodes are vulnerable to data
  breaches and single points of failure that could compromise entire cluster operations.
  This configuration is essential for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining
  cluster availability in production environments.
