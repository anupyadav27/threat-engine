severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud Machine Learning Platform for AI Training Jobs Have Intercontainer
  Encryption In Transit Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL training_job has intercontainer encryption in transit enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that training jobs in AliCloud Machine Learning Platform
  for AI have intercontainer encryption in transit enabled to protect data communication
  between containers during distributed training. Without this encryption, sensitive
  training data and model parameters transmitted between containers are vulnerable
  to interception and unauthorized access. Enabling intercontainer encryption is essential
  for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for machine
  learning workloads.
