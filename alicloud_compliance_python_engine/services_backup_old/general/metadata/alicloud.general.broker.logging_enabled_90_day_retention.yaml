  Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL broker has logging enabled 90 day retention properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Message Queue for Apache Kafka instances have logging
  enabled with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without adequate log retention,
  organizations cannot perform effective security incident analysis, forensic investigations,
  or meet compliance requirements for audit trails. Insufficient log retention periods
  may result in loss of critical security evidence and violation of regulatory mandates.
