title: AliCloud Message Queue for Apache RocketMQ Broker Should Use Cluster Deployment
  Mode With Redundancy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL broker has cluster deployment mode with redundancy properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Message Queue for Apache RocketMQ brokers are deployed in
  cluster mode with redundancy to prevent single points of failure. Single broker
  deployments can lead to message loss, service unavailability, and compliance violations
  during system failures. Implementing redundant cluster deployment enhances data
  durability and meets high availability requirements for production workloads.
