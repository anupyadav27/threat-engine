title: Ensure AliCloud Function Compute Functions Have URL Public Access Blocked
rationale: Ensures GENERAL function has url public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Function Compute functions do not allow unrestricted
  public URL access, which could expose sensitive application logic and data to unauthorized
  users. Public function URLs without proper access controls can lead to data breaches,
  unauthorized code execution, and compliance violations with security frameworks
  requiring principle of least privilege access.
