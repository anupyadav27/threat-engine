  monitored through log metric filters with alerting mechanisms and maintain logs
  for at least 90 days. Unmonitored route changes can lead to network security breaches,
  unauthorized access paths, and compliance violations. Proper logging and alerting
  of route modifications ensures rapid detection of potential security incidents and
  supports forensic analysis requirements.
