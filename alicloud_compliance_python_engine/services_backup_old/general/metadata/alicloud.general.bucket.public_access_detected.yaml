title: Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service Bucket Public Access Detected
rationale: Ensures GENERAL bucket has public access detected properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Detects Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets configured with public read
  or write access permissions that could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
  Public bucket access poses significant data breach risks and may violate compliance
  requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS. Immediate remediation is required
  to prevent unauthorized data access and potential regulatory penalties.
