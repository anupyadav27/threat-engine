title: Ensure ApsaraDB RDS Instance Configuration Changes Have Log Metric Filters
  and Alerts with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has sql instance configuration
  changes enabled 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that log metric filters and alerts are configured
  to monitor ApsaraDB RDS instance configuration changes with a minimum 90-day log
  retention period. Without proper monitoring and alerting, unauthorized database
  configuration modifications could go undetected, potentially compromising data security
  and regulatory compliance. Extended log retention ensures sufficient audit trail
  for forensic analysis and compliance requirements.
