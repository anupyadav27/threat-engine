title: Ensure AliCloud Container Registry repositories block public access
rationale: Ensures GENERAL repositories has public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Container Registry repositories are configured
  to prevent unauthorized public access. Public repositories expose container images
  and potentially sensitive application code to unauthorized users, creating significant
  security risks and potential compliance violations. Restricting repository access
  helps maintain confidentiality of proprietary software and reduces attack surface.
