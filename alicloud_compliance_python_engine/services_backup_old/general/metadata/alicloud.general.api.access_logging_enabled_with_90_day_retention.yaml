title: AliCloud API Gateway Access Logging Must Be Enabled With 90 Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL api has access logging enabled with 90 day retention properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that API Gateway instances have access logging enabled with a
  minimum retention period of 90 days to maintain comprehensive audit trails. Without
  proper access logging and retention, organizations cannot effectively monitor API
  usage, detect security incidents, or meet compliance requirements for data retention
  and forensic analysis. This control is essential for maintaining security visibility
  and regulatory compliance across API infrastructure.
