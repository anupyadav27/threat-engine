title: ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL Statement Logging Flag Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance_postgres has statement logging flag enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that statement logging is enabled for ApsaraDB RDS PostgreSQL
  instances to capture all SQL statements executed against the database. Without statement
  logging, security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and compliance violations
  cannot be properly audited or investigated. This configuration is essential for
  meeting regulatory compliance requirements and maintaining comprehensive database
  security monitoring.
