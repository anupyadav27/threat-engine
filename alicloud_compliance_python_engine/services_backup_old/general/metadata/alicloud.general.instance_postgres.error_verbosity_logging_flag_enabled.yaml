title: AliCloud ApsaraDB for RDS PostgreSQL Error Verbosity Logging Flag Should Be
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance_postgres has error verbosity logging flag enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that PostgreSQL instances have error verbosity logging enabled
  to capture detailed error information for security monitoring and troubleshooting.
  Without proper error verbosity configuration, security incidents and database anomalies
  may go undetected, hindering compliance with audit requirements and incident response
  capabilities. This setting is essential for maintaining comprehensive audit trails
  and meeting regulatory compliance standards.
