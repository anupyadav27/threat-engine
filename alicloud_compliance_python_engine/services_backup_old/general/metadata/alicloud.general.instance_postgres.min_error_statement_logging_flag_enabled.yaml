title: ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL Min Error Statement Logging Flag Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance_postgres has min error statement logging flag
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the min_error_statement_logging flag is enabled for ApsaraDB
  RDS PostgreSQL instances to log SQL statements that cause errors at or above the
  specified severity level. This configuration is critical for security monitoring,
  forensic analysis, and compliance requirements as it helps identify potential SQL
  injection attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and database errors that could
  indicate security incidents.
