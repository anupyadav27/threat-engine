title: AliCloud Service Catalog Portfolio Sharing Should Be Restricted Within Organization
  Boundaries
rationale: Ensures GENERAL portfolio has restricted sharing within organization properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Service Catalog portfolios are only shared within organizational
  boundaries to prevent unauthorized external access to cloud resources and templates.
  Unrestricted portfolio sharing can lead to data exposure, unauthorized resource
  provisioning, and compliance violations. This control helps maintain proper access
  governance and reduces the risk of sensitive infrastructure templates being accessed
  by unintended parties.
