title: Ensure AliCloud ActionTrail Log Metric Filters and Alerts for Audit Configuration
  Changes Have 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has audit configuration changes
  enabled 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that log metric filters and alerts are configured
  to monitor audit configuration changes with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without
  proper monitoring and retention of configuration change events, organizations cannot
  effectively detect unauthorized modifications to critical security settings or maintain
  compliance with regulatory requirements. Insufficient retention periods may result
  in loss of critical audit evidence needed for forensic analysis and compliance reporting.
