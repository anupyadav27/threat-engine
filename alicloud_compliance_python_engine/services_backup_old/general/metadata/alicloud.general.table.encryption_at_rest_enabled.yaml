title: AliCloud Table Store Encryption at Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL table has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Table Store instances have encryption at rest enabled
  to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without encryption at rest,
  data stored in Table Store is vulnerable to physical security breaches and may not
  meet compliance requirements for data protection standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA,
  or GDPR. Enabling encryption at rest provides an additional layer of security by
  encrypting data using AliCloud's managed encryption keys.
