title: Alibaba Cloud CDN Distribution Origin Failover Configured With Redundancy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL distributions has origin failover configured with redundancy
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud CDN distributions have origin failover configured
  with redundant origin servers to maintain high availability and prevent service
  disruptions. Without proper origin failover redundancy, CDN distributions become
  single points of failure that can lead to complete service outages and potential
  compliance violations for availability requirements. This configuration is critical
  for maintaining business continuity and meeting SLA commitments.
