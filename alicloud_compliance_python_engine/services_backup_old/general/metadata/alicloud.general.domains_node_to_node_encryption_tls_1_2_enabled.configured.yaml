title: Ensure AliCloud domains have node-to-node encryption with TLS 1.2 enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL domains_node_to_node_encryption_tls_1_2_enabled has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that node-to-node communication encryption is configured
  with TLS 1.2 or higher for AliCloud domain services. Unencrypted or weakly encrypted
  inter-node communication can expose sensitive data to interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Proper TLS 1.2+ encryption is essential for compliance with data protection
  regulations and maintaining data confidentiality in distributed systems.
