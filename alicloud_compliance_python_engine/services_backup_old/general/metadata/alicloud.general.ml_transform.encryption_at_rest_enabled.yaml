subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: AliCloud Machine Learning Transform Encryption At Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL ml_transform has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Machine Learning Transform jobs have encryption
  at rest enabled to protect sensitive training data and model artifacts. Without
  encryption at rest, ML datasets and transformed data stored in underlying storage
  systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. This control is
  essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements
  for sensitive machine learning workloads.
