resource: eks
requirement: Audit Logging Enabled For Security Compliance
scope: general.eks.logging
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) has audit logging
  enabled for security compliance
rationale: Ensures GENERAL eks has audit logging enabled for security compliance properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for ACK clusters to
  maintain comprehensive security monitoring and compliance requirements. Without
  audit logging, security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and compliance
  violations may go undetected, creating significant security gaps. Proper audit logging
  is essential for forensic analysis, regulatory compliance, and maintaining security
  posture visibility.
