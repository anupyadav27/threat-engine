rationale: Ensures GENERAL development_endpoint has job bookmark encryption at rest
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that job bookmark encryption at rest is enabled for Alibaba Cloud
  DataWorks development endpoints to protect sensitive job state information and metadata.
  Unencrypted job bookmarks can expose processing states, data lineage information,
  and workflow metadata to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches
  and compliance violations. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting regulatory requirements for data protection.
