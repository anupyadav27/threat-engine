title: Alibaba Cloud Function Compute Functions Should Block Public Access
rationale: Ensures GENERAL function has public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Function Compute functions are not publicly accessible without
  proper authentication and authorization controls. Public access to functions can
  expose sensitive business logic, lead to unauthorized code execution, and result
  in potential data breaches or compliance violations. Restricting public access helps
  maintain the principle of least privilege and reduces the attack surface.
