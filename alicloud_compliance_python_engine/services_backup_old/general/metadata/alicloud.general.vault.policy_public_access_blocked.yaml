title: AliCloud Key Management Service Vault Policy Should Block Public Access
rationale: Ensures GENERAL vault has policy public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Key Management Service (KMS) vault policies do
  not allow public access to cryptographic keys and secrets. Public access to vault
  policies can expose sensitive encryption keys to unauthorized users, potentially
  leading to data breaches and compliance violations with regulations such as PCI
  DSS and GDPR. Proper access controls should restrict vault access to specific authenticated
  principals only.
