title: AliCloud DataWorks Data Catalog Public Access Should Be Blocked Via Access
  Control List
rationale: Ensures GENERAL data_catalog has public access blocked via acl properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks Data Catalog instances are not publicly accessible
  through proper ACL configuration. Public access to data catalogs can expose sensitive
  metadata, database schemas, and data lineage information to unauthorized users,
  potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Implementing restrictive
  ACLs helps maintain data governance and meets regulatory requirements for data protection.
