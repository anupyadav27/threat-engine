title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Container Service Task Definitions Have Logging Enabled
  with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL task_definition has logging enabled 90 day retention properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Container Service task definitions have logging
  properly configured with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without adequate log
  retention, organizations lose critical audit trails and forensic evidence needed
  for security incident investigation and compliance requirements. Insufficient logging
  retention can result in compliance violations and inability to detect or investigate
  security breaches effectively.
