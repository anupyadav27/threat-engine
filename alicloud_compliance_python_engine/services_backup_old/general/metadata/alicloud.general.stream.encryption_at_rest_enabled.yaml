title: AliCloud Log Service Stream Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL stream has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Log Service streams have encryption at rest enabled
  to protect sensitive log data from unauthorized access. Without encryption at rest,
  log data stored in streams remains vulnerable to data breaches and may not meet
  compliance requirements for data protection standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI
  DSS. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and regulatory
  compliance.
