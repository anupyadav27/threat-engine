title: Ensure AliCloud Account is Part of Resource Directory Organization Structure
rationale: Ensures GENERAL account has part of organization structure properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that the AliCloud account is properly integrated within
  a Resource Directory organization structure for centralized governance and security
  management. Accounts operating outside of an organizational structure lack centralized
  security policies, compliance monitoring, and unified access controls, potentially
  leading to security gaps and regulatory violations. Proper organization membership
  enables consolidated billing, cross-account resource sharing controls, and enterprise-wide
  security policy enforcement.
