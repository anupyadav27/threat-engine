title: Alibaba Cloud CDN Distribution Origin Traffic Encryption In Transit Must Be
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL distributions has origin traffic encryption in transit
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud CDN distributions have encryption in transit
  enabled for origin traffic to protect data transmission between CDN edge nodes and
  origin servers. Unencrypted origin traffic exposes sensitive data to interception
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially violating data protection regulations
  and compromising application security. This control is essential for maintaining
  end-to-end encryption and meeting compliance requirements for data in transit.
