title: Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service Instance with Public IP Address Detected
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance has public ip detected properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies ECS instances that have been assigned public IP
  addresses, which may expose resources to internet-based threats and unauthorized
  access attempts. Public IP assignments increase the attack surface and can lead
  to compliance violations in environments requiring strict network isolation. Organizations
  should evaluate whether public internet access is necessary and implement proper
  security controls.
