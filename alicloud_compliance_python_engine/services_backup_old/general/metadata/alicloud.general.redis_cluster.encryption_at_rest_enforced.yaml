title: ApsaraDB for Redis Cluster Encryption at Rest Should Be Enforced
rationale: Ensures GENERAL redis_cluster has encryption at rest enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis clusters have encryption at rest enabled
  to protect sensitive data stored in memory and during persistence operations. Without
  encryption at rest, cached data and Redis snapshots remain vulnerable to unauthorized
  access, potentially exposing sensitive application data and violating data protection
  compliance requirements.
