title: Alibaba Cloud Container Registry Public Access Should Be Blocked
rationale: Ensures GENERAL registry has public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Container Registry instances are not publicly
  accessible to prevent unauthorized access to container images and potential data
  breaches. Public registry access can expose sensitive application code, proprietary
  software, and security vulnerabilities to malicious actors, violating compliance
  requirements and organizational security policies.
