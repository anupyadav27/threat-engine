subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud Model Invocation Logs Have Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL model_invocation_logs has encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that model invocation logs in AliCloud are encrypted
  at rest to protect sensitive AI/ML model usage data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted
  logs can expose confidential model interactions, training data patterns, and business
  intelligence to potential attackers. Enabling encryption at rest helps meet compliance
  requirements for data protection regulations and maintains the confidentiality of
  machine learning operations.
