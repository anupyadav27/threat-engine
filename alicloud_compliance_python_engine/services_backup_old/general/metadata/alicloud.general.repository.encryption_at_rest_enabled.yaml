  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Container Registry repositories have encryption
  at rest enabled to protect container images and metadata from unauthorized access.

  stored in repositories are vulnerable to data breaches and may not meet compliance
  requirements for data protection standards. This control is essential for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of containerized applications and their associated
  secrets.
