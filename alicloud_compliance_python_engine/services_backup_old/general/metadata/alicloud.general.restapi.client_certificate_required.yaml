title: AliCloud API Gateway REST API Client Certificate Authentication Required
rationale: Ensures GENERAL restapi has client certificate required properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud API Gateway REST API endpoints require client certificate
  authentication for enhanced security. Without mandatory client certificates, APIs
  are vulnerable to unauthorized access, man-in-the-middle attacks, and potential
  data breaches. This control is essential for meeting compliance requirements and
  implementing zero-trust security principles.
