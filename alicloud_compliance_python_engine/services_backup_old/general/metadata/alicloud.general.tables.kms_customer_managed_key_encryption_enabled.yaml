title: Ensure AliCloud Table Store Tables Use KMS Customer Managed Key Encryption
rationale: Ensures GENERAL tables has kms customer managed key encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Table Store tables are encrypted using KMS customer
  managed keys rather than service managed keys. Using customer managed keys provides
  enhanced security control, enables key rotation policies, and helps meet compliance
  requirements for data protection. Without customer managed encryption, organizations
  may face regulatory compliance issues and reduced control over their encryption
  keys.
