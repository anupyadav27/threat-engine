title: Ensure AliCloud cluster tags are automatically copied to snapshots for proper
  resource governance
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster_tags_copied_to_snapshots has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that cluster tags are configured to be automatically
  copied to their associated snapshots. Without proper tag inheritance, snapshots
  may lack critical metadata for cost allocation, compliance tracking, and security
  governance. This can lead to orphaned resources, audit failures, and difficulty
  in maintaining proper data lineage and access controls.
