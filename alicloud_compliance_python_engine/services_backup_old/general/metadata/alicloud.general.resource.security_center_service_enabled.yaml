title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Security Center Service is Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL resource has security center service enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that Security Center service is enabled to provide comprehensive
  security monitoring and threat detection across cloud resources. Without Security
  Center enabled, organizations lack centralized visibility into security vulnerabilities,
  compliance violations, and potential threats, significantly increasing the risk
  of undetected security incidents and regulatory non-compliance.
