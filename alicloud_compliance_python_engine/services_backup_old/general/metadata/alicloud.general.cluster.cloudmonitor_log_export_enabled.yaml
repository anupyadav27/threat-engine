title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Log Export is Enabled for Clusters
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster has cloudmonitor log export enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor log export functionality is properly
  enabled for cluster resources to ensure comprehensive audit trails and monitoring
  capabilities. Without log export enabled, security incidents may go undetected and
  compliance requirements for log retention and analysis cannot be met. Enabling log
  export is essential for maintaining visibility into cluster operations and supporting
  forensic investigations.
