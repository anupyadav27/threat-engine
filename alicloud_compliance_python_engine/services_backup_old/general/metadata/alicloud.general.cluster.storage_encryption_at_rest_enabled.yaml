  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that storage encryption at rest is enabled for Alibaba Cloud
  Container Service for Kubernetes clusters to protect sensitive data from unauthorized

  data to potential security breaches and compliance violations. This control helps
  meet regulatory requirements such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and other data protection standards.
