subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: high
title: Hybrid Backup Recovery Vault Should Have Encryption and Backup Storage Immutability
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures HBR vault has encryption backup storage immutability enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery (HBR) vaults have both
  encryption and backup storage immutability features enabled to protect backup data
  from unauthorized access and ransomware attacks. Without these protections, backup
  data remains vulnerable to data breaches and malicious deletion, potentially compromising
  disaster recovery capabilities and regulatory compliance requirements. Enabling
  immutability prevents backup data from being modified or deleted during the retention
  period, providing critical protection against cyber threats.
