title: Hybrid Backup Recovery vault should have encryption at rest enabled
rationale: Ensures HBR vault has encryption encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery (HBR) vaults have encryption
  at rest enabled to protect backup data from unauthorized access. Without encryption
  at rest, sensitive backup data stored in HBR vaults remains vulnerable to data breaches
  and may not meet compliance requirements for data protection standards. Enabling
  encryption at rest helps organizations maintain data confidentiality and meet regulatory
  compliance obligations.
