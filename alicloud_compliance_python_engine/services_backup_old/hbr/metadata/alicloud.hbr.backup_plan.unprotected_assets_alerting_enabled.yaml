title: Hybrid Backup Recovery Backup Plan Should Have Unprotected Assets Alerting
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_plan has unprotected assets alerting enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery backup plans have unprotected assets
  alerting enabled to notify administrators when resources are not covered by backup
  policies. Without this alerting mechanism, critical assets may remain unprotected
  without visibility, leading to potential data loss during incidents and non-compliance
  with data protection requirements. This monitoring capability is essential for maintaining
  comprehensive backup coverage across your infrastructure.
