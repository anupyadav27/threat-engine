service: hbr
resource: replication
requirement: Encryption In Transit TLS Required
scope: hbr.replication.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Hybrid Backup Recovery replication must enforce TLS encryption for data in
  transit
rationale: Ensures HBR replication has encryption in transit tls required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery replication jobs use TLS
  encryption to protect data during transmission between source and destination. Without
  TLS encryption, backup data transmitted over networks is vulnerable to interception
  and unauthorized access, potentially exposing sensitive information and violating
  data protection compliance requirements.
