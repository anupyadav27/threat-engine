subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: medium
title: Hybrid Backup Recovery disaster recovery backup immutable or WORM protection
  should be enabled where supported
rationale: Ensures HBR dr has backup immutable or worm enabled where supported properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery disaster recovery backups have immutable
  storage or Write Once Read Many (WORM) protection enabled to prevent unauthorized
  deletion or modification. Without immutable backup protection, critical data recovery
  points are vulnerable to ransomware attacks, accidental deletion, or malicious tampering,
  potentially compromising business continuity and regulatory compliance requirements.
