title: Hybrid Backup Recovery Job Failure Monitoring Alert Rules Must Be Configured
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_recovery_job has monitoring alert rules for job failures
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that monitoring alert rules are properly configured for Hybrid
  Backup Recovery job failures to enable immediate detection of backup and recovery
  operation failures. Without proper alerting mechanisms, failed backup jobs may go
  unnoticed, leading to data loss risks and potential compliance violations. This
  control is essential for maintaining business continuity and meeting regulatory
  requirements for data protection and disaster recovery preparedness.
