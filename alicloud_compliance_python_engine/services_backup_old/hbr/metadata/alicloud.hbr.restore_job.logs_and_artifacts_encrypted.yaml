title: Hybrid Backup Recovery restore job logs and artifacts should be encrypted
rationale: Ensures HBR restore_job has logs and artifacts encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery restore job logs and artifacts are
  encrypted to protect sensitive backup metadata and operational data. Unencrypted
  logs and artifacts can expose backup configurations, file paths, and system information
  to unauthorized access, potentially violating data protection regulations and compromising
  security posture. This control is essential for maintaining confidentiality of backup
  operations and meeting compliance requirements.
