description: This rule verifies that Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch Service domains have
  CloudMonitor logging enabled to capture operational metrics and security events.
  Without proper logging enabled, organizations lose visibility into search operations,
  performance anomalies, and potential security incidents, which can impact compliance
  requirements and incident response capabilities. Enabling CloudMonitor logging is
  essential for maintaining audit trails and meeting regulatory compliance standards.
