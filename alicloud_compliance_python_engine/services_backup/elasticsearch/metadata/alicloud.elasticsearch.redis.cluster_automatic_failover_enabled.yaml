description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis clusters have automatic failover enabled
  to maintain high availability and prevent service disruptions. Without automatic
  failover, Redis cluster outages can lead to application downtime, data access interruptions,
  and potential compliance violations for systems requiring continuous availability.
  This configuration is essential for meeting business continuity requirements and
  maintaining service reliability.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH redis has cluster automatic failover enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
