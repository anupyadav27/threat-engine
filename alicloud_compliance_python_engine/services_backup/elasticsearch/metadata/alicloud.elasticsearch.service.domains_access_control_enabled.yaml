description: This rule verifies that Elasticsearch Service domains have proper access
  control mechanisms configured to restrict unauthorized access. Without access control,
  Elasticsearch clusters are exposed to potential data breaches, unauthorized data
  manipulation, and compliance violations. Enabling access control helps meet security
  compliance requirements and protects sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch indices.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH service has domains access control enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
