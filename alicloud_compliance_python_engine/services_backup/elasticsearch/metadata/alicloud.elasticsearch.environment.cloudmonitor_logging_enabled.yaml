  Elasticsearch Service instances to capture operational metrics and security events.
  Without proper logging enabled, security incidents may go undetected and compliance
  requirements for audit trails cannot be met. Enabling CloudMonitor logging is essential
  for maintaining visibility into cluster operations and meeting regulatory compliance
  standards.
