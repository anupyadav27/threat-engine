description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch Service instances are not exposed
  to the public internet through unrestricted access configurations. Public accessibility
  increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized data access, data breaches,
  and compliance violations. Restricting access to trusted networks and implementing
  proper network controls helps maintain data confidentiality and meets security compliance
  requirements.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH service has not publicly accessible properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
