description: Ensures that Redis clusters within AliCloud Elasticsearch service have
  in-transit encryption enabled to protect data during transmission. Without encryption
  in transit, sensitive data flowing between Redis cluster nodes and clients is vulnerable
  to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. This security control is essential
  for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for data
  protection standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH redis has cluster in transit encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
