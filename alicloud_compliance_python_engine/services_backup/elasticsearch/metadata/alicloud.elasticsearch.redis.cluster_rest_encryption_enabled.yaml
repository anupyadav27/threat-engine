description: Ensures that AliCloud Elasticsearch Redis clusters have rest encryption
  enabled to protect sensitive data stored in memory and on disk. Without encryption
  at rest, data stored in Redis clusters remains vulnerable to unauthorized access,
  potentially exposing sensitive application data and violating compliance requirements
  such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH redis has cluster rest encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
