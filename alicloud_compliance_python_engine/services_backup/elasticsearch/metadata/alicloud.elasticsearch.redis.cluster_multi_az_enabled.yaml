description: Ensures that AliCloud Elasticsearch Redis clusters are deployed across
  multiple Availability Zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Single-AZ
  deployments create a single point of failure that can lead to service disruptions
  and potential data loss during zone-level outages. Multi-AZ configuration is essential
  for meeting business continuity requirements and compliance standards that mandate
  resilient infrastructure design.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH redis has cluster multi az enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
