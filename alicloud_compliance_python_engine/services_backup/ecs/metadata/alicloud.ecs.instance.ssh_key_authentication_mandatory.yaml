compliance:
- rbi_bank_multi_cloud_9.1_0026
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances are configured to use SSH key pairs
  for authentication rather than password-based authentication. Password authentication
  is vulnerable to brute force attacks and credential theft, while SSH key authentication
  provides stronger cryptographic security. Enforcing SSH key authentication helps
  meet compliance requirements for secure remote access and reduces the risk of unauthorized
  instance access.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has ssh key authentication mandatory
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
