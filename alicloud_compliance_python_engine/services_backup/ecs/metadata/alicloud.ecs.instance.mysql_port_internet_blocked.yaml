description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow inbound MySQL
  traffic (port 3306) from the internet through security group rules. Exposing MySQL
  ports to the internet increases the risk of unauthorized database access, data breaches,
  and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has mysql port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
