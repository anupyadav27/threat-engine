description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow inbound traffic
  on Memcached port 11211 from the internet through security group rules. Exposing
  Memcached services directly to the internet creates significant security risks including
  data exposure, DDoS amplification attacks, and unauthorized access to cached sensitive
  information. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks requiring
  proper network segmentation and access controls.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has memcached port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
