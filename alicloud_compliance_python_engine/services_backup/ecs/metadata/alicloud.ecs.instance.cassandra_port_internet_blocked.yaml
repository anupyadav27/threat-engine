description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow inbound traffic
  on Cassandra database ports (9042, 9160) from the internet through security group
  rules. Exposing Cassandra ports to the internet increases the risk of unauthorized
  database access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations with data protection
  regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has cassandra port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
