description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances do not
  allow inbound internet traffic on port 445 (CIFS/SMB). Exposing CIFS ports to the
  internet creates significant security risks including unauthorized file system access,
  data exfiltration, and vulnerability to ransomware attacks. Blocking internet access
  to CIFS ports helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and prevents common
  attack vectors targeting Windows file sharing protocols.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has cifs port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
