description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public access to Memcached port 11211 (TCP/UDP). Public exposure of Memcached services
  can lead to data breaches, cache poisoning attacks, and unauthorized access to sensitive
  cached information. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  that require proper network access controls and principle of least privilege.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has memcached port public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
