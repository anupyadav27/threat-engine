description: Internet-facing ECS instances should have RAM roles configured with minimal
  necessary permissions to reduce attack surface and potential data exposure. Overprivileged
  instance profiles on public-facing instances can lead to privilege escalation attacks
  and unauthorized access to sensitive AliCloud resources. This control helps maintain
  compliance with security frameworks requiring least privilege access principles.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has internet facing instance profile
  least privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
