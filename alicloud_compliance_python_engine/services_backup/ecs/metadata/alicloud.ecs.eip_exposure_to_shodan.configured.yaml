description: Ensures that Elastic IP Addresses (EIPs) attached to ECS instances are
  properly configured to minimize exposure to Shodan and other internet scanning services.
  Unprotected EIPs can reveal sensitive service information, increase attack surface,
  and lead to compliance violations by exposing internal infrastructure details to
  public reconnaissance tools.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service eip_exposure_to_shodan has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
