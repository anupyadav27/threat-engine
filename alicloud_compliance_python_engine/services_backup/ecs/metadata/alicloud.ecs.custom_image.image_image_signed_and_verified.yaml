  and are properly verified before deployment. Unsigned or unverified images pose
  significant security risks including malware injection, unauthorized modifications,
  and compliance violations. Proper image signing ensures integrity and authenticity
  of custom images used in ECS instances.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service custom_image has image image signed and
  verified properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
