description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) snapshots are not configured
  with public access permissions. Public snapshots can expose sensitive data, system
  configurations, and proprietary information to unauthorized users, potentially leading
  to data breaches and compliance violations. Restricting snapshot access to authorized
  accounts only maintains data confidentiality and meets security compliance requirements.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service snapshot has snapshot not public properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
