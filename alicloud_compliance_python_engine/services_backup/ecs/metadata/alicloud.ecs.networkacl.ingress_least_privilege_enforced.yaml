description: Ensures that Network ACL ingress rules are configured with minimal necessary
  permissions to reduce attack surface. Overly permissive ingress rules can expose
  instances to unauthorized access and potential security breaches. This control helps
  maintain compliance with security frameworks by enforcing restrictive network access
  policies.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has ingress least privilege
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
