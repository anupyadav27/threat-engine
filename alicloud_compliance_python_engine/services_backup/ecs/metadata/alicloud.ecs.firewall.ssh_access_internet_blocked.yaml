description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) security groups do not allow
  SSH access (port 22) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted SSH access exposes
  instances to brute force attacks and unauthorized access, violating security compliance
  frameworks and increasing the risk of data breaches and system compromise.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service firewall has ssh access internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
