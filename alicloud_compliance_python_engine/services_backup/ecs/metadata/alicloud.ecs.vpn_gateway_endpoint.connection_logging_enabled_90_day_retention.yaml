description: Ensures that VPN Gateway endpoint connections have logging enabled with
  a minimum 90-day retention period to maintain comprehensive audit trails. Without
  proper connection logging and retention, organizations cannot effectively monitor
  VPN access patterns, investigate security incidents, or meet compliance requirements
  for network access auditing. This control is essential for detecting unauthorized
  access attempts and maintaining forensic capabilities for security investigations.
