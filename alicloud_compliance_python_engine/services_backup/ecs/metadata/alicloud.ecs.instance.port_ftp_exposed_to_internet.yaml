description: This rule identifies ECS instances with FTP port (21) exposed to the
  internet through security group rules. FTP transmits credentials and data in plain
  text, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Exposing FTP
  services publicly violates security compliance frameworks and increases the attack
  surface for potential data breaches.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has port ftp exposed to internet
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
