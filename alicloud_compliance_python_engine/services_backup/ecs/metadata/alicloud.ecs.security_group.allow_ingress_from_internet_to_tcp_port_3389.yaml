description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 3389 (RDP).
  Exposing RDP services directly to the internet significantly increases the risk
  of brute force attacks, unauthorized access, and potential system compromise. This
  configuration violates security best practices and may impact compliance with data
  protection regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port 3389 properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
