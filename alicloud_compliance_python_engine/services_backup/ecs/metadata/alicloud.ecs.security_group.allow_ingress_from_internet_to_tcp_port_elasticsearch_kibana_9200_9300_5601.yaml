description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted internet access to Elasticsearch (ports 9200, 9300) and Kibana (port
  5601) services. Exposing these ports to the internet creates significant security
  risks including unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and potential data
  breaches. This configuration violates security best practices and may impact compliance
  with data protection regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port elasticsearch kibana 9200 9300 5601 properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
