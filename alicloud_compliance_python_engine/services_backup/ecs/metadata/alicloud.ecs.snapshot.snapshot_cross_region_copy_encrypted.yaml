description: This rule verifies that ECS snapshots are encrypted when copied across
  regions to protect sensitive data during transit and storage. Unencrypted cross-region
  snapshot copies expose data to potential interception and unauthorized access, violating
  data protection regulations and security compliance requirements. Enabling encryption
  ensures data confidentiality and helps meet regulatory standards for data protection.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service snapshot has snapshot cross region copy
  encrypted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
