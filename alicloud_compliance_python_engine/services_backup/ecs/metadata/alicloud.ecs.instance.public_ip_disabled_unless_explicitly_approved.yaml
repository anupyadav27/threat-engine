description: This rule ensures that ECS instances do not have public IP addresses
  assigned unless there is explicit business justification and approval. Public IP
  addresses increase the attack surface by making instances directly accessible from
  the internet, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  compliance violations. Implementing proper approval processes for public IP assignment
  helps maintain network security boundaries and supports compliance with security
  frameworks that require network segmentation.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has public ip disabled unless
  explicitly approved properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
