description: Detects ECS instances configured with default service accounts that have
  unrestricted API access permissions. This configuration poses significant security
  risks as it grants excessive privileges that could be exploited by attackers to
  access sensitive resources or perform unauthorized operations. Using overprivileged
  service accounts violates the principle of least privilege and may lead to compliance
  violations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has default service account in
  use with full api access properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
