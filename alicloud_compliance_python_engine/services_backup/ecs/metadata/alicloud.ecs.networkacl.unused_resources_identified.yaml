description: This rule identifies unused Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Elastic
  Compute Service that are not associated with any subnets or instances. Unused network
  ACLs create unnecessary attack surface, increase management complexity, and may
  lead to compliance violations by maintaining dormant security configurations that
  are not actively monitored or maintained.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has unused resources identified
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
