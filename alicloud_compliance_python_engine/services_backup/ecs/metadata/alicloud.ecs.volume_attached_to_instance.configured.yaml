description: Verifies that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) disk volumes are correctly
  attached to running instances to prevent data accessibility issues and potential
  security vulnerabilities. Unattached volumes may contain sensitive data that remains
  accessible outside of proper instance security controls, creating compliance risks
  and potential data exposure scenarios.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service volume_attached_to_instance has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
