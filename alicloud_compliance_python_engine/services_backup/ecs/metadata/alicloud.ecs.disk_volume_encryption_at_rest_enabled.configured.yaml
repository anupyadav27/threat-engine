description: This rule verifies that ECS disk volumes have encryption at rest properly
  configured to protect sensitive data stored on disk. Unencrypted disk volumes expose
  data to unauthorized access in case of physical theft or improper disposal, potentially
  violating data protection regulations like GDPR. Enabling encryption at rest ensures
  data confidentiality and helps meet compliance requirements for data security.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk_volume_encryption_at_rest_enabled
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
