description: IP forwarding should be disabled on ECS instances to prevent them from
  acting as routers and forwarding network traffic between different network segments.
  Enabling IP forwarding can create security vulnerabilities by allowing unauthorized
  network routing, potentially bypassing network security controls and enabling lateral
  movement attacks. This configuration helps maintain network segmentation and reduces
  the attack surface in compliance with security best practices.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has ip forwarding disabled for
  security properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
