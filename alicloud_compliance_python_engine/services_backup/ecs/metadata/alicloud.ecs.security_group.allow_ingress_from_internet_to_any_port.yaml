description: This rule identifies ECS security groups that allow unrestricted inbound
  access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to any port. Such overly permissive configurations
  expose instances to potential security threats including unauthorized access, data
  breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting ingress rules to specific IP ranges
  and required ports follows security best practices and helps maintain regulatory
  compliance.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to any port properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
