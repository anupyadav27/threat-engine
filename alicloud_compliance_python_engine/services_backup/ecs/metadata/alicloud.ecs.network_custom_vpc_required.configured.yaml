description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances are deployed within
  custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks rather than the legacy classic network.
  Classic networks lack advanced security features like security groups, network ACLs,
  and proper network isolation, exposing instances to potential unauthorized access
  and compliance violations. Custom VPCs provide enhanced network security controls
  and are required for meeting enterprise security standards.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service network_custom_vpc_required has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
