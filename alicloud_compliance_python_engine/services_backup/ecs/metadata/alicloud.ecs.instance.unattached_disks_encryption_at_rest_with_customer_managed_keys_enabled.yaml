description: This rule verifies that unattached ECS disks are encrypted using customer-managed
  KMS keys rather than service-managed keys. Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted
  disks pose data confidentiality risks and may not meet regulatory compliance requirements
  for data protection. Customer-managed keys provide enhanced control over encryption
  key lifecycle and access policies.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has unattached disks encryption
  at rest with customer managed keys enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
