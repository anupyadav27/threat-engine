description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted internet access to MongoDB default ports 27017 and 27018. Exposing
  MongoDB services directly to the internet creates significant security risks including
  unauthorized data access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations with
  data protection regulations. Security groups should restrict MongoDB access to specific
  trusted IP ranges or use VPN connections for remote database administration.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port mongodb 27017 27018 properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
