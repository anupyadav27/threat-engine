description: Security groups should be configured with a default deny all policy to
  ensure that only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted. Without this configuration,
  unintended network access may occur, potentially exposing instances to unauthorized
  connections and increasing the attack surface. This practice is essential for maintaining
  network segmentation and meeting security compliance requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has default deny all properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
