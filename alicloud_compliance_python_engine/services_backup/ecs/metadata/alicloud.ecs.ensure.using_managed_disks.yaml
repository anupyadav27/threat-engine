description: This rule verifies that ECS instances utilize managed disks rather than
  unmanaged storage options. Managed disks provide enhanced security features including
  built-in encryption, automated backup capabilities, and centralized access control,
  reducing the risk of data exposure and ensuring compliance with data protection
  requirements. Unmanaged disks lack these security controls and may expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized access.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ensure has using managed disks properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
