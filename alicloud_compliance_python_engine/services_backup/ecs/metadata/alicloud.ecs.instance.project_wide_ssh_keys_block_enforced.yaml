description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are configured to block project-wide
  SSH keys, preventing unauthorized access through shared SSH keys across the entire
  project. Blocking project-wide SSH keys reduces the attack surface by ensuring only
  instance-specific SSH keys can be used for authentication, improving access control
  and reducing the risk of lateral movement in case of key compromise.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has project wide ssh keys block
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
