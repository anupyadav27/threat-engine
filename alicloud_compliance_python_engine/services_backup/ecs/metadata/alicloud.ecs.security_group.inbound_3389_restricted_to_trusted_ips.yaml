description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access on port 3389 (RDP) from any source IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted
  RDP access significantly increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized remote
  access, brute force attacks, and potential data breaches. This control is essential
  for maintaining compliance with security frameworks and protecting Windows-based
  ECS instances from external threats.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has inbound 3389 restricted
  to trusted ips properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
