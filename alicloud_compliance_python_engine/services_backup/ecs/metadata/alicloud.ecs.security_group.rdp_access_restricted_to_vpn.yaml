description: This rule verifies that security groups do not allow unrestricted RDP
  (port 3389) access from the internet and limit RDP connectivity to VPN networks
  only. Unrestricted RDP access exposes Windows instances to brute force attacks,
  unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. Restricting RDP to VPN networks
  ensures secure remote access and helps maintain compliance with security frameworks.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has rdp access restricted
  to vpn properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
