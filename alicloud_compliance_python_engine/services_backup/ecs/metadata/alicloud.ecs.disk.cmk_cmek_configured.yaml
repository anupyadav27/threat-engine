description: This rule ensures that ECS disk volumes are encrypted using Customer
  Master Keys (CMK) or Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed
  keys. Without CMK/CMEK encryption, sensitive data stored on disk volumes may be
  vulnerable to unauthorized access and may not meet compliance requirements for data
  protection standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or SOC 2.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk has cmk cmek configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
