description: Ensures that Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Elastic Compute
  Service instances do not allow unrestricted inbound access on RDP port 3389 from
  any source (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted RDP access significantly increases the attack
  surface and risk of brute force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized system
  access and compliance violations with security frameworks like CIS and PCI DSS.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has rdp port 3389 ingress restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
