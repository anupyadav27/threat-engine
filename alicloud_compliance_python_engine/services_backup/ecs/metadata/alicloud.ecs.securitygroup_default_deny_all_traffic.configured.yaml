description: Security groups should be configured with default deny rules to block
  all inbound and outbound traffic by default, following the principle of least privilege.
  Without proper default deny configurations, security groups may inadvertently allow
  unauthorized network access, creating potential attack vectors and compliance violations.
  This control ensures that only explicitly permitted traffic flows are allowed through
  security group rules.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service securitygroup_default_deny_all_traffic
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
