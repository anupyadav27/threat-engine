description: VPC Flow Logs should be enabled for subnets to capture network traffic
  metadata for security monitoring and analysis. Without flow logging, organizations
  cannot effectively detect suspicious network activities, investigate security incidents,
  or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements that mandate network traffic
  monitoring. This creates blind spots in network visibility that can be exploited
  by attackers.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service subnet has flow logging enabled for traffic
  analysis properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
