description: Ensures that all ECS disk volumes have automated backup plans configured
  to protect against data loss and meet disaster recovery requirements. Without enforced
  backup plans, organizations face significant risks of permanent data loss due to
  hardware failures, accidental deletions, or security incidents. This control is
  essential for maintaining business continuity and meeting compliance requirements
  for data protection and retention policies.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk_volume has backup plan enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
