description: This rule identifies ECS instances with public IP addresses that are
  discoverable through the Shodan search engine, indicating potential security exposure.
  Public-facing services indexed by Shodan can be targeted by attackers for reconnaissance
  and exploitation, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This exposure may violate compliance requirements for data protection and network
  security controls.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service public has address shodan properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
