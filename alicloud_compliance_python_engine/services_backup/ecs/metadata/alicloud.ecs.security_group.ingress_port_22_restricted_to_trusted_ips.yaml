description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  SSH access (port 22) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted SSH access significantly
  increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access, brute force attacks,
  and potential data breaches. This control is essential for maintaining compliance
  with security frameworks and preventing lateral movement within cloud infrastructure.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has ingress port 22 restricted
  to trusted ips properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
