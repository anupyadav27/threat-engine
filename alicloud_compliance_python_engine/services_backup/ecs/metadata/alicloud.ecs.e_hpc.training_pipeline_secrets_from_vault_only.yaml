description: This rule verifies that Elastic High Performance Computing (E-HPC) training
  pipelines retrieve secrets exclusively from secure vault services rather than hardcoded
  values or insecure storage. Improper secret management in HPC training workflows
  can lead to credential exposure, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and compliance
  violations with data protection regulations. Organizations must implement centralized
  secret management to maintain security posture in high-performance computing environments.
domain: secrets_and_key_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service e_hpc has training pipeline secrets from
  vault only properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
