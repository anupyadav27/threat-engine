description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  inbound FTP traffic (ports 20-21) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). FTP transmits data
  in plaintext including credentials, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized
  access. Allowing unrestricted FTP access from the internet significantly increases
  the attack surface and may violate security compliance requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port ftp 20 21 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
