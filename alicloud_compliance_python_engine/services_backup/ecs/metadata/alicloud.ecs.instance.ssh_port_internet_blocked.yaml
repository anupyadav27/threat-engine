description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances do not
  allow SSH access (port 22) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Exposing SSH ports to
  the internet increases the risk of brute force attacks, unauthorized access, and
  potential data breaches. Restricting SSH access to specific IP ranges or using bastion
  hosts helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and reduces the attack
  surface.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has ssh port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
