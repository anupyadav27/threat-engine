description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  SSH access on TCP port 22 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted SSH access
  significantly increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access, brute
  force attacks, and potential system compromise. This configuration is essential
  for maintaining security compliance and protecting ECS instances from external threats.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service securitygroup_ingress_tcp_port_22_internet_access_blocked
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
