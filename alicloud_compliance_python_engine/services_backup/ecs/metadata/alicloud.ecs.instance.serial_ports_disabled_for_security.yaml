description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have serial console access disabled
  to prevent unauthorized access through out-of-band management interfaces. Serial
  console access can bypass network-based security controls and provide direct system
  access, potentially allowing attackers to gain privileged access or extract sensitive
  information. Disabling serial ports helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  that require restricting administrative access channels.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has serial ports disabled for
  security properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
