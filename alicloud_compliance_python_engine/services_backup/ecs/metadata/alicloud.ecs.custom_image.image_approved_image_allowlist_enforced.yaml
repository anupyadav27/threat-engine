description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) custom images are created
  only from pre-approved base images defined in an organizational allowlist. Using
  unapproved or untrusted base images can introduce security vulnerabilities, malware,
  or compliance violations into the cloud infrastructure. This control helps maintain
  consistent security baselines and reduces the attack surface by preventing the use
  of potentially compromised or non-compliant images.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service custom_image has image approved image allowlist
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
