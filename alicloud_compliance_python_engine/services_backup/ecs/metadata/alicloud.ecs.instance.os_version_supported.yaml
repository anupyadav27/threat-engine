description: This rule ensures that ECS instances are running operating system versions
  that receive security updates and vendor support. Unsupported OS versions lack critical
  security patches, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers and
  may violate compliance requirements. Running outdated operating systems significantly
  increases the risk of security breaches and system compromises.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has os version supported properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
