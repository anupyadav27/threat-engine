description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have serial console access properly
  restricted to prevent unauthorized administrative access. Unrestricted serial console
  access can allow attackers to bypass network-based security controls and gain direct
  access to virtual machines, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. Proper restriction of serial console access is essential for maintaining
  secure cloud infrastructure and meeting security compliance requirements.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm serial console access
  restricted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
