description: This rule ensures that inactive ECS key pairs are automatically disabled
  after 90 days to reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access through
  dormant credentials. Inactive key pairs pose significant security risks as they
  may be forgotten, unmonitored, or compromised without detection, potentially leading
  to compliance violations and unauthorized system access.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service key_pair has inactive keys disabled after
  90 days properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
