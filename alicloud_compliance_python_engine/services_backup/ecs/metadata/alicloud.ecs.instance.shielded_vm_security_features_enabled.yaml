description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are configured with Shielded VM
  security features to protect against rootkits, bootkits, and kernel-level malware.
  Enabling these features provides hardware-based security validation during boot
  processes and runtime, which is essential for maintaining system integrity and meeting
  security compliance requirements.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has shielded vm security features
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
