description: This rule verifies that all data volumes attached to ECS instances are
  encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed
  keys. Using CMEK provides enhanced security control and key management capabilities,
  ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and reducing risks of unauthorized
  data access. Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted volumes may expose sensitive
  data and fail to meet enterprise security requirements.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm data volumes encrypted
  cmek properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
