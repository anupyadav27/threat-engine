description: Security groups created through Launch Wizard often contain overly permissive
  default rules that may allow unrestricted access from the internet. These default
  configurations can expose instances to unauthorized access and potential security
  breaches, violating security compliance requirements. Organizations should review
  and customize security group rules to follow the principle of least privilege.

rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has from launch wizard properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
