description: This rule identifies ECS instances with RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
  port 3389 accessible from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Exposing RDP directly to the
  internet significantly increases the attack surface and risk of brute force attacks,
  unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. This configuration violates security
  best practices and may impact compliance with data protection regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has port rdp exposed to internet
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
