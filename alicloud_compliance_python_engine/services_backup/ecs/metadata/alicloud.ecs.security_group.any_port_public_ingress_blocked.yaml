description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) on all ports. Allowing public ingress
  on any port creates significant security vulnerabilities by exposing instances to
  potential attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access. This configuration violates
  security best practices and compliance frameworks that require restricted network
  access controls.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has any port public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
