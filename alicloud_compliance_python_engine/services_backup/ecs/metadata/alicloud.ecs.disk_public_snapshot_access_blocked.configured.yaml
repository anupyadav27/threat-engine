description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) disk snapshots are not publicly
  accessible to prevent unauthorized data exposure and potential security breaches.
  Public snapshot access can lead to sensitive data leakage and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. This control helps maintain data confidentiality
  by restricting snapshot visibility to authorized users only.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk_public_snapshot_access_blocked has
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
