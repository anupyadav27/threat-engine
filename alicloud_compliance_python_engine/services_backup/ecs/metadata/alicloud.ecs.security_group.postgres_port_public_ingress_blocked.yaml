description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access to PostgreSQL database port 5432 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Exposing
  PostgreSQL ports publicly increases the risk of unauthorized database access, data
  breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has postgres port public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
