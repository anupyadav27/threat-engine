description: This rule verifies that ECS EBS snapshots are encrypted to protect data
  at rest from unauthorized access. Unencrypted snapshots expose sensitive data to
  potential security breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI
  DSS and GDPR. Enabling snapshot encryption ensures data confidentiality and helps
  maintain regulatory compliance standards.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ebs has snapshots encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
