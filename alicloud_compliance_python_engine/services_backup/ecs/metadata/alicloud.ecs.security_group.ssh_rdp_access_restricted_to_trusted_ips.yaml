description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389) access from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted
  remote access significantly increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized
  access, brute force attacks, and potential data breaches. This control is essential
  for maintaining compliance with security frameworks and protecting critical infrastructure.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has ssh rdp access restricted
  to trusted ips properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
