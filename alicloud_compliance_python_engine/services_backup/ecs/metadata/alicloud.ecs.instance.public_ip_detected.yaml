description: This rule detects ECS instances that have been assigned public IP addresses,
  which directly expose compute resources to the internet. Public IP assignments increase
  the attack surface and create potential security vulnerabilities, as instances become
  directly accessible from external networks. This configuration may violate security
  compliance frameworks that require network isolation and controlled access through
  load balancers or NAT gateways.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has public ip detected properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
