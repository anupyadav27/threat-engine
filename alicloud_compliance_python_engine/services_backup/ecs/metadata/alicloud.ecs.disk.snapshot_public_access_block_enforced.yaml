  configured to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Public snapshots can
  expose confidential information, virtual machine configurations, and application
  data to unauthorized users, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. This control is essential for maintaining data privacy and meeting regulatory
  requirements for data protection.
