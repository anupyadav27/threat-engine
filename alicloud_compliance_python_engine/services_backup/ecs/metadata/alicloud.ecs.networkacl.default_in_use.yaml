description: Default Network ACLs in Elastic Compute Service typically have permissive
  rules that may allow unrestricted traffic flow, creating potential security vulnerabilities.
  Using default Network ACL configurations can expose instances to unauthorized access
  and fail to meet security compliance requirements that mandate principle of least
  privilege for network access controls.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has default in use properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
