description: This rule verifies that ECS snapshots are encrypted to protect data at
  rest from unauthorized access. Unencrypted snapshots expose sensitive data to potential
  breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Encryption
  ensures that snapshot data remains protected even if storage media is compromised.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service snapshot has snapshot encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
