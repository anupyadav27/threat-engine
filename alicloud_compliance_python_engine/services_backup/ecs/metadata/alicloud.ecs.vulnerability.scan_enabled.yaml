description: This rule verifies that vulnerability scanning is enabled for Elastic
  Compute Service instances to detect security weaknesses and potential threats. Without
  active vulnerability scanning, instances may remain exposed to known security vulnerabilities,
  increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Regular vulnerability
  scanning is essential for maintaining security compliance and protecting cloud infrastructure
  from emerging threats.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service vulnerability has scan enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
