description: This rule ensures that ECS snapshots are encrypted at rest to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted snapshots expose data to potential
  security breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
  Enabling encryption at rest provides an additional layer of security for backup
  data stored in AliCloud.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service snapshot has encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
