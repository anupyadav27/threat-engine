description: This rule ensures that ECS disk volumes are encrypted at rest to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted disk volumes expose data to
  potential security breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI
  DSS, GDPR, and other data protection regulations. Enabling encryption at rest provides
  an additional layer of security for stored data.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk_volume has encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
