description: Network ACLs with unrestricted ingress rules (0.0.0.0/0) expose ECS instances
  to potential unauthorized access and security breaches. This configuration violates
  security best practices and may impact compliance with data protection regulations.
  Restricting ingress traffic to specific IP ranges and required ports reduces the
  attack surface and enhances network security posture.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has unrestricted ingress properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
