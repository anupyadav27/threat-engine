description: This rule ensures that ECS task definitions have logging block mode enabled
  to prevent potential log tampering and unauthorized access to sensitive log data.
  Without proper logging block mode configuration, applications may be vulnerable
  to log injection attacks and compliance violations related to audit trail integrity.
  Enabling this feature helps maintain secure logging practices and supports regulatory
  compliance requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service task_definitions has logging block mode
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
