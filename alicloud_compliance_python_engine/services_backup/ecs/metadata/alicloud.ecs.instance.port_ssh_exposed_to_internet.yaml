description: This rule identifies ECS instances with SSH port 22 accessible from the
  internet (0.0.0.0/0), which creates significant security risks including brute force
  attacks and unauthorized access. Exposing SSH to the internet violates security
  best practices and may impact compliance with security frameworks that require restricted
  administrative access.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has port ssh exposed to internet
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
