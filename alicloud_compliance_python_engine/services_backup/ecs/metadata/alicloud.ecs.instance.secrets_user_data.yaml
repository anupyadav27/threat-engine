description: This rule ensures that ECS instance user data does not contain hardcoded
  secrets such as passwords, API keys, or access tokens. Secrets in user data pose
  significant security risks as they are stored in plaintext and can be accessed by
  anyone with instance metadata access permissions. This violates security best practices
  and compliance requirements for data protection.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has secrets user data properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
