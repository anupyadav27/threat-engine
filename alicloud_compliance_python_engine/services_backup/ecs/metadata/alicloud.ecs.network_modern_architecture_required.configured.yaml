description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances are deployed
  within Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks rather than the legacy classic network
  architecture. Using classic networks exposes instances to security risks including
  insufficient network isolation, limited access control capabilities, and potential
  unauthorized access from other tenants. VPC architecture provides enhanced security
  through network segmentation, custom routing, and granular security group controls
  required for compliance frameworks.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service network_modern_architecture_required has
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
