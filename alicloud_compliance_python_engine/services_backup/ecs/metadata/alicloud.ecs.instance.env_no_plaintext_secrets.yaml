description: This rule ensures that ECS instances do not store sensitive information
  such as passwords, API keys, or tokens in plaintext environment variables. Plaintext
  secrets in environment variables can be easily exposed through process listings,
  system logs, or container inspection commands, creating significant security vulnerabilities.
  This practice violates security compliance standards and increases the risk of credential
  theft and unauthorized access to cloud resources.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has env no plaintext secrets properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
