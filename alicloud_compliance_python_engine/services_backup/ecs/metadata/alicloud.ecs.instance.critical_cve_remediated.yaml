description: This rule verifies that all critical Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) have been addressed on ECS instances through patching or mitigation measures.
  Unpatched critical vulnerabilities expose instances to potential exploitation, data
  breaches, and system compromise. Maintaining current security patches is essential
  for regulatory compliance and protecting against known attack vectors.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has critical cve remediated properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
