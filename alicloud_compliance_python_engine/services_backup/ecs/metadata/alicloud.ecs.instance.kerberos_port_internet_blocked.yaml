description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow inbound traffic
  on Kerberos ports (88, 464, 749, 750) from the internet through security group rules.
  Exposing Kerberos authentication services to the internet increases the risk of
  credential attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and potential compromise of domain
  authentication systems. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  that require restricting administrative and authentication services to trusted networks
  only.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has kerberos port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
