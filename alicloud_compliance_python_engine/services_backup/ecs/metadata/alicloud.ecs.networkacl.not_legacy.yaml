description: Legacy Network ACL configurations in ECS may lack modern security features
  and proper access controls, potentially exposing instances to unauthorized network
  access. Using outdated Network ACL implementations can lead to security vulnerabilities
  and non-compliance with current security standards. Organizations should migrate
  to current Network ACL configurations to ensure proper network segmentation and
  access control.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has not legacy properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
