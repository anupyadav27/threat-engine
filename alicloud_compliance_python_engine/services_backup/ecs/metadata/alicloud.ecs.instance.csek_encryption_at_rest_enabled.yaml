description: This rule ensures that ECS instances use Customer-Supplied Encryption
  Keys (CSEK) for data encryption at rest, providing enhanced security control over
  encryption keys. Without CSEK encryption, sensitive data stored on ECS instances
  may be vulnerable to unauthorized access and may not meet compliance requirements
  for data protection standards. Enabling CSEK encryption allows organizations to
  maintain full control over their encryption keys while ensuring data confidentiality.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has csek encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
