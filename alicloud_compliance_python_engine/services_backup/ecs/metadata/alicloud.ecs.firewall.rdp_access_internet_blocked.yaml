description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) security groups do not allow
  inbound RDP (port 3389) access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted RDP access
  exposes Windows instances to brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.
  This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks that require restricted
  administrative access to cloud resources.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service firewall has rdp access internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
