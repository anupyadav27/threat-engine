description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  inbound traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 11211, which is commonly
  used by Memcached. Exposing Memcached directly to the internet creates significant
  security risks including data exposure, cache poisoning, and potential DDoS amplification
  attacks. This configuration violates security best practices and may impact compliance
  with data protection regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port memcached 11211 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
