description: This rule detects ECS security groups that allow unrestricted inbound
  access (0.0.0.0/0) from the internet on any port. Such overly permissive rules create
  significant security vulnerabilities by exposing instances to potential attacks,
  data breaches, and unauthorized access. This configuration violates security best
  practices and may impact compliance with data protection regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has wide open public ipv4
  detected properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
