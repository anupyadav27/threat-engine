description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access on TCP port 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
  Exposing RDP services directly to the internet significantly increases the risk
  of brute force attacks, unauthorized access, and potential system compromise. This
  configuration helps maintain compliance with security frameworks that require restricted
  administrative access.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service securitygroup_ingress_tcp_3389_from_internet_blocked
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
