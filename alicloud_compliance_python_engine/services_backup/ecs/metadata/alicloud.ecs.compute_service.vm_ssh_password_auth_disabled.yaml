description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are configured to disable SSH password
  authentication, requiring key-based authentication instead. Password-based SSH authentication
  is vulnerable to brute force attacks and credential stuffing, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access and data breaches. Disabling password authentication and
  enforcing SSH key pairs significantly reduces attack surface and helps meet security
  compliance requirements.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm ssh password auth
  disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
