description: Security groups with an excessive number of ingress and egress rules
  increase attack surface and complexity, making it difficult to maintain proper access
  controls. Large rule sets can lead to misconfigurations, overlapping permissions,
  and compliance violations. Regular review and consolidation of security group rules
  helps maintain the principle of least privilege and reduces security risks.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has excessive ingress egress
  rules reviewed properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
