description: This rule verifies that all attached disks on ECS instances are encrypted
  using Customer Master Keys (CMK) rather than service-managed keys. Unencrypted or
  inadequately encrypted disks expose sensitive data to unauthorized access and may
  violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Using CMK encryption provides
  enhanced security control and key management capabilities for data protection.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ensure has attached disks encrypted with
  cmk properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
