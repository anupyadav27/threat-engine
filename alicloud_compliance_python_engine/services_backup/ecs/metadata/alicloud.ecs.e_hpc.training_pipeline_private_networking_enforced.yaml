description: This rule verifies that E-HPC training pipelines are configured to use
  private networking instead of public internet connectivity. Public network exposure
  increases the risk of unauthorized access, data interception, and potential compliance
  violations with data protection regulations. Private networking ensures secure communication
  between compute nodes and reduces the attack surface for machine learning workloads.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service e_hpc has training pipeline private networking
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
