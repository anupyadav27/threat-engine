description: This rule identifies Network ACLs that allow unrestricted ingress access
  on TCP port 22 (SSH). Overly permissive SSH access increases the attack surface
  and risk of unauthorized remote access to ECS instances. Restricting SSH access
  to specific IP ranges helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and reduces
  exposure to brute force attacks.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has allow ingress tcp port 22
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
