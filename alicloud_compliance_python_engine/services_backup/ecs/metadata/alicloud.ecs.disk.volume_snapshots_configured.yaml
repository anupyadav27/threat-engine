description: This rule verifies that ECS disk volumes have snapshot policies configured
  to enable regular backup creation. Without proper snapshot configuration, organizations
  face significant data loss risks during system failures, security incidents, or
  accidental deletions. Proper snapshot management is essential for meeting disaster
  recovery requirements and compliance standards that mandate data backup and retention
  policies.
