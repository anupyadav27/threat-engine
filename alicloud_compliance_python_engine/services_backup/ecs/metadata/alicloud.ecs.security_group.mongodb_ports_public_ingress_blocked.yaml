description: This rule verifies that ECS security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public access (0.0.0.0/0) to MongoDB default ports (27017-27019). Exposing MongoDB
  ports to the internet creates significant security risks including unauthorized
  database access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations with data protection
  regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has mongodb ports public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
