description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have detailed monitoring activated
  to provide comprehensive visibility into system performance and security metrics.
  Without detailed monitoring, security incidents may go undetected, and compliance
  requirements for audit trails and performance monitoring cannot be met. Enabling
  detailed monitoring is essential for proactive threat detection and maintaining
  operational security standards.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has detailed monitoring active
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
