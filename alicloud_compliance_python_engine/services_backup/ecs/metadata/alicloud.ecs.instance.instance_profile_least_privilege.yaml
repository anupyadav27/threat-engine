description: Ensures ECS instances are assigned RAM roles through instance profiles
  that follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for their intended function. Overprivileged instance profiles can lead
  to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive AliCloud resources.
  This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks that require proper
  access management and reduces the attack surface of compromised instances.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has instance profile least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
