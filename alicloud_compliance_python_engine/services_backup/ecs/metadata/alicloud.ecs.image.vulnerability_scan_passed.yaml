description: This rule verifies that ECS images have successfully completed vulnerability
  scanning to identify and address security weaknesses before deployment. Images without
  proper vulnerability scanning may contain known security flaws, malware, or outdated
  components that could expose instances to attacks and compromise compliance with
  security frameworks. Regular vulnerability scanning of images is essential for maintaining
  a secure cloud infrastructure and meeting regulatory requirements.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service image has vulnerability scan passed properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
