description: ECS instances using paravirtual virtualization type are deprecated and
  pose security risks due to lack of hardware-level isolation and reduced security
  features compared to hardware virtual machine (HVM) instances. This configuration
  may impact compliance requirements and expose workloads to potential security vulnerabilities
  through shared kernel access.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has paravirtual type deprecated
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
