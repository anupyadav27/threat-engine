description: Ensures that ECS launch templates are configured with instance profiles
  that follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for the instance to function. Overprivileged instance profiles can lead
  to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and reduces the
  attack surface of your cloud infrastructure.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch_template has instance profile least
  privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
