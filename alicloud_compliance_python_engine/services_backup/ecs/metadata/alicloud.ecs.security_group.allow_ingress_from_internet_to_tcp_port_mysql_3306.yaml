description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 3306, commonly
  used by MySQL databases. Exposing MySQL directly to the internet creates significant
  security risks including unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential
  compliance violations with data protection regulations.

  to tcp port mysql 3306 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
