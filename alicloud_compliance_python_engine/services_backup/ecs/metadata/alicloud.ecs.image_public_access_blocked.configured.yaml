description: This rule verifies that custom ECS images have public access blocked
  to prevent unauthorized access to potentially sensitive system configurations and
  data. Public images can expose proprietary software configurations, security credentials,
  or compliance-sensitive data to unauthorized users. Proper image access controls
  are essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting regulatory compliance
  requirements.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service image_public_access_blocked has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
