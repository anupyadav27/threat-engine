description: Unattached ECS disks without encryption at rest expose sensitive data
  to unauthorized access if storage media is compromised or improperly disposed of.
  This creates significant security risks and may violate data protection compliance
  requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific regulations that mandate
  encryption of data at rest.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service unattached_disks has encryption at rest
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
