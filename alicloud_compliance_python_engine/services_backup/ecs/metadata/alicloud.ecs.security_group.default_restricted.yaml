description: Default security groups in Alibaba Cloud ECS should not allow unrestricted
  inbound or outbound traffic to prevent unauthorized access and potential security
  breaches. Overly permissive default security group rules can expose instances to
  attacks and may violate compliance frameworks that require network segmentation
  and least privilege access controls.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has default restricted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
