description: This rule verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
  for OS Login on Elastic Compute Service instances. Without MFA, user authentication
  relies solely on passwords or SSH keys, creating significant security vulnerabilities
  including unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling MFA adds an
  essential security layer that helps meet compliance requirements for access control
  and identity management.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service project has os login mfa enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
