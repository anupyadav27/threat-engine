description: Training jobs in Elastic Compute Service should have encryption enabled
  for inter-container communication to protect sensitive data in transit between containers.
  Unencrypted inter-container communication can expose training data, model parameters,
  and other sensitive information to potential interception or tampering. This security
  control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance
  requirements for machine learning workloads.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service training_job_inter_container has encryption
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
