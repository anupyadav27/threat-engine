description: Ensures that traffic logging is enabled for ECS load balancers to capture
  detailed request and response information. Without proper logging, organizations
  cannot monitor suspicious activities, investigate security incidents, or meet compliance
  requirements for audit trails. This creates blind spots in network traffic analysis
  and hampers incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service loadbalancer has traffic logging enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
