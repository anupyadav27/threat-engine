description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are configured with confidential
  computing capabilities to protect data and code during processing. Without confidential
  computing, sensitive workloads may be vulnerable to unauthorized access from privileged
  users or malicious software at the infrastructure level. Enabling this feature is
  essential for compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining trust
  boundaries in multi-tenant cloud environments.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has confidential computing enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
