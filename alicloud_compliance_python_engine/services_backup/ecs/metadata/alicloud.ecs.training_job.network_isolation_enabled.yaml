description: Ensures that ECS training jobs have network isolation enabled to prevent
  unauthorized network access and data exfiltration. Without proper network isolation,
  training jobs may be exposed to lateral movement attacks and sensitive data could
  be compromised. This control is essential for maintaining compliance with data protection
  regulations and securing machine learning workloads.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service training_job has network isolation enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
