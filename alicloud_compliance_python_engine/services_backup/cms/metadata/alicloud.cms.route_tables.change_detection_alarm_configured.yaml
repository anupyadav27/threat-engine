  and security posture by potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access or
  creating network segmentation bypasses. Configuring CloudMonitor change detection
  alarms for route tables ensures immediate notification of unauthorized or unexpected
  routing changes, enabling rapid incident response and maintaining network security
  compliance requirements.
