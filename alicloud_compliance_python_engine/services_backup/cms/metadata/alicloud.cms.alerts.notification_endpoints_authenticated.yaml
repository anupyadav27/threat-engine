description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service alert notification endpoints
  are properly authenticated to prevent unauthorized access to monitoring alerts.
  Unauthenticated notification endpoints can expose sensitive system status information
  and allow malicious actors to intercept or manipulate alert notifications. Proper
  authentication ensures compliance with security frameworks and protects critical
  monitoring infrastructure from unauthorized access.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CMS alerts has notification endpoints authenticated properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
