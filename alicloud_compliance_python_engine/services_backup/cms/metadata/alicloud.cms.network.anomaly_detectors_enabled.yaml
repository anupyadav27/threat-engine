description: This rule verifies that network anomaly detection is enabled in AliCloud
  CloudMonitor Service to automatically identify unusual network traffic patterns
  and potential security threats. Without anomaly detection, organizations may miss
  critical security incidents such as DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, or unauthorized
  network access that could lead to compliance violations and data breaches. Enabling
  network anomaly detectors provides real-time threat detection capabilities essential
  for maintaining security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CMS network has anomaly detectors enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
