  and alarms configured to detect configuration changes in AliCloud Config. Without
  these monitoring controls, unauthorized or accidental configuration modifications
  may go undetected, potentially compromising security posture and compliance requirements.
  Proper alerting ensures timely response to configuration drift and maintains audit
  trail integrity.
