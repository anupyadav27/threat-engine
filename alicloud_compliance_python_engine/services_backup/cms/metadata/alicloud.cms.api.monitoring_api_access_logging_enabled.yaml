description: This rule verifies that API access logging is enabled for CloudMonitor
  Service to track all API calls and administrative actions. Without proper API logging,
  security incidents cannot be effectively investigated, and unauthorized access to
  monitoring configurations may go undetected. Enabling API access logging is essential
  for compliance with security frameworks and maintaining audit trails for monitoring
  infrastructure changes.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS api has monitoring api access logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
