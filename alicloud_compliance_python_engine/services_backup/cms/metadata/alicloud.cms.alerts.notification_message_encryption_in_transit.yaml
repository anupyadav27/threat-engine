description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service alert notifications are
  transmitted using encrypted channels to protect sensitive monitoring data and alert
  information from interception during transmission. Unencrypted notification channels
  can expose critical system alerts, performance metrics, and infrastructure details
  to potential eavesdropping attacks. Proper encryption in transit is essential for
  maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for secure
  monitoring communications.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CMS alerts has notification message encryption in transit properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
