description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service network anomaly detection
  alert destinations are configured with encrypted transmission channels. Unencrypted
  alert destinations can expose sensitive security information about network anomalies
  and infrastructure vulnerabilities during transmission. Proper encryption of anomaly
  detection notifications is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting
  security compliance requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CMS network has anomaly destinations encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
