description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor change detection alarms are properly
  configured to monitor Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) modifications and configuration
  changes. Without proper change detection monitoring, unauthorized VPC modifications
  such as route table changes, security group alterations, or network ACL updates
  may go unnoticed, potentially compromising network security and compliance requirements.
  Implementing VPC change detection alarms is essential for maintaining audit trails
  and meeting regulatory compliance standards.
