description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service has proper metric filters
  and alarms configured to detect AWS Config configuration changes. Without these
  monitoring controls, unauthorized configuration modifications may go undetected,
  potentially compromising security posture and compliance requirements. Proper alerting
  ensures rapid response to configuration drift and maintains audit trail integrity.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter and alarm for aws config configuration
  changes enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
