description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for E-MapReduce clusters to
  capture system events, job execution details, and security-related activities. Without
  proper logging enabled, organizations cannot effectively monitor cluster operations,
  detect security incidents, or maintain audit trails required for compliance frameworks.
  Disabled logging significantly impairs incident response capabilities and forensic
  analysis in case of security breaches.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS emr has logging enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
