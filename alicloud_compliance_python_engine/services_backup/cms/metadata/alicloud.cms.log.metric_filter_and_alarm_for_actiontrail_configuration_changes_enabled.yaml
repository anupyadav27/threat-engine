description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service has proper metric filters
  and alarms configured to detect ActionTrail configuration changes. Without these
  monitoring controls, unauthorized modifications to audit logging configurations
  may go undetected, potentially compromising security incident response capabilities
  and regulatory compliance requirements. Proper alerting on ActionTrail changes ensures
  immediate visibility into critical audit trail modifications.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter and alarm for actiontrail configuration
  changes enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
