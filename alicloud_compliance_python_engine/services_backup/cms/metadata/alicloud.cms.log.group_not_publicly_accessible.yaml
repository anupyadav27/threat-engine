description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service (CMS) log groups are not
  configured with public access permissions. Publicly accessible log groups can expose
  sensitive monitoring data, application logs, and system metrics to unauthorized
  users, potentially leading to information disclosure and compliance violations.
  Restricting access to log groups helps maintain data confidentiality and meets security
  compliance requirements.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CMS log has group not publicly accessible properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
