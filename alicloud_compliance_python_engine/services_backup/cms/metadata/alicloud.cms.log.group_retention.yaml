description: Ensures CloudMonitor Service log groups have appropriate retention periods
  configured to maintain audit trails and comply with regulatory requirements. Inadequate
  log retention can result in loss of critical security events and forensic evidence,
  potentially violating compliance frameworks that mandate specific log retention
  periods. Proper retention configuration helps organizations meet audit requirements
  and maintain security visibility over time.
