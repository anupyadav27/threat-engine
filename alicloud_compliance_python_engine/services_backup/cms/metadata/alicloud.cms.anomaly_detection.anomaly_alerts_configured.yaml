description: This rule verifies that anomaly detection alerts are configured in AliCloud
  CloudMonitor Service to automatically identify unusual patterns in system metrics
  and resource behavior. Proper anomaly detection configuration is essential for early
  threat detection, preventing security incidents from escalating, and maintaining
  compliance with monitoring requirements. Without configured anomaly alerts, organizations
  may miss critical security events, performance degradations, or unauthorized access
  attempts that deviate from normal operational patterns.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS anomaly_detection has anomaly alerts configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
