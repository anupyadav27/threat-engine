description: This rule verifies that activity logs stored in CloudMonitor Service
  are encrypted using Customer Managed Keys (CMK) rather than service-managed keys.
  Unencrypted or inadequately encrypted activity logs expose sensitive operational
  data and access patterns to potential unauthorized access. Implementing CMK encryption
  ensures compliance with data protection regulations and provides enhanced control
  over encryption key management and rotation policies.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CMS storage has account with activity logs cmk encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
