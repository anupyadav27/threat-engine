description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service has proper alerting mechanisms
  configured to detect breaches of Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time
  Objective (RTO) thresholds in disaster recovery scenarios. Without these critical
  alerts, organizations may fail to meet business continuity requirements and compliance
  mandates, potentially resulting in extended downtime and data loss that exceeds
  acceptable business limits.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS dr has monitoring alerts for rpo rto breach configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
