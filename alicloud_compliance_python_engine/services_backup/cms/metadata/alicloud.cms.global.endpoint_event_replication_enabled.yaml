description: This rule verifies that endpoint event replication is enabled for AliCloud
  CloudMonitor Service to ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
  Without proper event replication, monitoring data and alerts may be lost during
  service disruptions, potentially leading to undetected security incidents and compliance
  violations. Enabling event replication helps maintain continuous monitoring coverage
  and supports regulatory requirements for data availability and incident detection.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CMS global has endpoint event replication enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
