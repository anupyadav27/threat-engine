description: This rule verifies that a CloudMonitor metric filter is configured to
  detect Key Management Service (KMS) key deletion or disable operations. Without
  proper monitoring of KMS key lifecycle events, organizations cannot detect unauthorized
  key management activities that could compromise data encryption and violate compliance
  requirements. Implementing this metric filter enables real-time alerting on critical
  cryptographic key operations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CMS metric has metric filter kms key deletion or disable detected
  filter present properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
