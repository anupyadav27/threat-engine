description: Authentication failure events should be monitored through CloudMonitor
  Service metric filters to detect potential brute force attacks, credential stuffing,
  or unauthorized access attempts. Without proper monitoring of authentication failures,
  security incidents may go undetected, leading to compliance violations and potential
  data breaches.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter authentication failures properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
