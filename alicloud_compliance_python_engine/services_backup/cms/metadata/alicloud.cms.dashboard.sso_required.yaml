description: This rule ensures that CloudMonitor Service dashboards enforce Single
  Sign-On (SSO) authentication for access control. Without SSO requirements, dashboards
  containing sensitive monitoring data and system metrics may be accessed through
  weaker authentication methods, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data exposure. Implementing SSO helps maintain centralized identity management and
  supports compliance with enterprise security policies.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CMS dashboard has sso required properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
