description: This rule verifies that Hologres databases do not have public sharing
  enabled, preventing unauthorized external access to sensitive analytical data. Public
  sharing exposes databases to potential data breaches and compliance violations by
  allowing unrestricted internet access. Disabling public sharing ensures that database
  access is properly controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES database has public sharing disabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
