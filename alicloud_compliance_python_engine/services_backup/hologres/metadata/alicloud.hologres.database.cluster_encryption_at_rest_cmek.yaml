description: This rule verifies that Hologres database clusters implement encryption
  at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed
  keys. Using CMEK provides enhanced security control and key management capabilities,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized data access and ensuring compliance with data
  protection regulations that require customer control over encryption keys.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES database has cluster encryption at rest cmek properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
