  sharing permissions, which could expose sensitive data warehouse information to
  unauthorized users. Publicly shared snapshots pose significant data security risks
  and may violate data protection compliance requirements by allowing unrestricted
  access to potentially sensitive analytical data.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES snapshot has publicly shared properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
