description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for Hologres database
  clusters to capture and monitor database access patterns, query execution, and administrative
  operations. Without proper audit logging, organizations cannot detect unauthorized
  access attempts, track data modifications, or meet compliance requirements for data
  governance and security monitoring. Enabling audit logs is essential for forensic
  analysis and maintaining regulatory compliance in data warehouse environments.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES database has cluster audit logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
