description: Ensures that KMS keys used for Hologres snapshot encryption are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overly permissive KMS
  key policies can lead to unauthorized access to encrypted snapshots and potential
  data breaches. This control helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations
  by enforcing proper access controls on encryption keys.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES snapshot_kms has least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
