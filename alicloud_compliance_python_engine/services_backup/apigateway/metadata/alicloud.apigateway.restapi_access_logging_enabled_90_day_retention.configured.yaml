description: Ensures that API Gateway REST APIs have access logging enabled with a
  minimum 90-day log retention period for comprehensive audit trails. Without proper
  access logging and retention, organizations cannot effectively monitor API usage
  patterns, detect security incidents, or meet compliance requirements for data access
  tracking. This configuration is essential for forensic analysis and regulatory compliance
  frameworks that mandate extended log retention periods.
