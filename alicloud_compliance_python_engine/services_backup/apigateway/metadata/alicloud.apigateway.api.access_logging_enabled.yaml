description: This rule verifies that access logging is enabled for API Gateway APIs
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of API requests and responses. Without proper
  access logging, organizations cannot effectively monitor API usage patterns, detect
  security threats, or meet compliance requirements for data access tracking. Enabling
  access logging is essential for security incident investigation and regulatory compliance
  frameworks.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures APIGATEWAY api has access logging enabled properly configured for
