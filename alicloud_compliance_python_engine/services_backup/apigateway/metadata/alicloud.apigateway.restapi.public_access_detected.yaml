description: This rule detects when AliCloud API Gateway REST APIs are configured
  to allow public internet access without proper access controls. Publicly accessible
  APIs can expose sensitive data and functionality to unauthorized users, potentially
  leading to data breaches, unauthorized operations, and compliance violations with
  data protection regulations. Organizations should implement proper authentication,
  authorization, and IP whitelisting to restrict API access to authorized users and
  systems only.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APIGATEWAY restapi has public access detected properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
