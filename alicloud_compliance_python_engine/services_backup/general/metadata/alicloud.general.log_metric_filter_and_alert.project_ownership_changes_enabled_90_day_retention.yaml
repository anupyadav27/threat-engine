description: This rule verifies that metric filters and alerts are configured to monitor
  project ownership changes in AliCloud Log Service with a minimum 90-day retention
  period. Monitoring ownership changes is critical for detecting unauthorized access
  escalation and maintaining audit trails for compliance requirements. Without proper
  monitoring and retention, security incidents involving privilege changes may go
  undetected or lack sufficient forensic data.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has project ownership changes
  enabled 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
