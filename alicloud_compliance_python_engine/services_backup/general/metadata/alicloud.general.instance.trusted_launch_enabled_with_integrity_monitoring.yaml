description: This rule ensures that ECS instances utilize Trusted Launch with integrity
  monitoring to protect against boot-level malware and rootkits. Without integrity
  monitoring, instances are vulnerable to firmware-level attacks that can compromise
  the entire system before the operating system loads. Enabling this feature helps
  meet security compliance requirements by providing hardware-based attestation of
  system integrity.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance has trusted launch enabled with integrity monitoring
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
