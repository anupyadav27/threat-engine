description: Ensures that the min_error_statement_logging flag is enabled for ApsaraDB
  RDS PostgreSQL instances to log SQL statements that cause errors at or above the
  specified severity level. This configuration is critical for security monitoring,
  forensic analysis, and compliance requirements as it helps identify potential SQL
  injection attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and database errors that could
  indicate security incidents.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance_postgres has min error statement logging flag
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
