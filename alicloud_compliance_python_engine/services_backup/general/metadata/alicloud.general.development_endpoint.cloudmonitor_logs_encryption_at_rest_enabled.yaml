description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor logs generated by development endpoints
  are encrypted at rest to protect sensitive operational data. Unencrypted logs can
  expose system information, application metrics, and potentially sensitive data to
  unauthorized access. Enabling encryption at rest helps meet compliance requirements
  and reduces the risk of data breaches from storage-level attacks.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL development_endpoint has cloudmonitor logs encryption at
  rest enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
