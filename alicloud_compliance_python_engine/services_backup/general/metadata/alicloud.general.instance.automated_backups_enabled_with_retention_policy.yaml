description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have automated backup mechanisms
  configured with appropriate retention policies to ensure data recovery capabilities.
  Without proper automated backups and retention policies, organizations face significant
  data loss risks and may fail to meet regulatory compliance requirements for data
  protection and business continuity. Inadequate backup configurations can result
  in extended downtime and inability to recover from system failures or security incidents.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance has automated backups enabled with retention policy
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
