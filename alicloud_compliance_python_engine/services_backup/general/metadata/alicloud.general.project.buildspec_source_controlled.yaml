description: This rule verifies that buildspec files for AliCloud CodePipeline projects
  are stored in source control rather than inline within the pipeline configuration.
  Storing buildspec inline poses security risks including lack of version control,
  audit trails, and proper code review processes, potentially leading to unauthorized
  build modifications and compliance violations.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has buildspec source controlled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
