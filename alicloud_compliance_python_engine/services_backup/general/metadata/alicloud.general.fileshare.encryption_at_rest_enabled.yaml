description: Ensures that AliCloud Network Attached Storage (NAS) file shares have
  encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without
  encryption at rest, data stored in file shares remains vulnerable to potential security
  breaches and may not meet compliance requirements for data protection standards
  such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or SOC 2. This security control is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and regulatory compliance.
