description: This rule identifies ECS instances that are directly accessible from
  the internet through public IP addresses or elastic IP addresses. Public-facing
  instances increase the attack surface and expose resources to potential security
  threats, unauthorized access attempts, and compliance violations. Organizations
  should implement proper network segmentation and access controls to minimize public
  exposure.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance has public access detected properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
