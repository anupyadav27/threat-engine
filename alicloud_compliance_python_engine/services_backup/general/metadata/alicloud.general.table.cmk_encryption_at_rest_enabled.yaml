description: This rule verifies that database tables are encrypted at rest using Customer
  Master Key (CMK) encryption to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  Without CMK encryption, data stored in tables remains vulnerable to potential data
  breaches and may not meet compliance requirements for data protection standards
  such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2. CMK encryption provides an additional layer of
  security by allowing customers to maintain control over encryption keys and access
  policies.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL table has cmk encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
