description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor log export functionality is properly
  enabled for cluster resources to ensure comprehensive audit trails and monitoring
  capabilities. Without log export enabled, security incidents may go undetected and
  compliance requirements for log retention and analysis cannot be met. Enabling log
  export is essential for maintaining visibility into cluster operations and supporting
  forensic investigations.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
