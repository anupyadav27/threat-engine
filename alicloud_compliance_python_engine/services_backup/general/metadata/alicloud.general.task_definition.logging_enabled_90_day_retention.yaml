  properly configured with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without adequate log
  retention, organizations lose critical audit trails and forensic evidence needed
  for security incident investigation and compliance requirements. Insufficient logging
  retention can result in compliance violations and inability to detect or investigate
  security breaches effectively.
