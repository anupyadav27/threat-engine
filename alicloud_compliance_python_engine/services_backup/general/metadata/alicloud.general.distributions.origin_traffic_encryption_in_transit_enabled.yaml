  enabled for origin traffic to protect data transmission between CDN edge nodes and
  origin servers. Unencrypted origin traffic exposes sensitive data to interception
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially violating data protection regulations
  and compromising application security. This control is essential for maintaining
  end-to-end encryption and meeting compliance requirements for data in transit.
