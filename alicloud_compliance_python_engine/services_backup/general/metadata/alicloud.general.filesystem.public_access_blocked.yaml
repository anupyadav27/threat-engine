description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud NAS filesystems are not publicly accessible
  from the internet to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
  Public access to filesystems can expose sensitive data and violate compliance requirements
  such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Proper access controls should be implemented using VPC
  networks and mount target restrictions.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL filesystem has public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
