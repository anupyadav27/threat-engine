description: This rule verifies that Machine Learning Platform for AI training jobs
  have encryption at rest enabled for both storage volumes and output data. Unencrypted
  training data and model outputs expose sensitive machine learning datasets and intellectual
  property to unauthorized access, potentially violating data protection regulations
  and compromising competitive advantages. Enabling encryption at rest ensures compliance
  with security frameworks and protects against data breaches in case of storage compromise.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL training_job has volume and output encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
