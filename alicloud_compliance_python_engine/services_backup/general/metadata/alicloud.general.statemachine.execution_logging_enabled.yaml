description: State machines without execution logging enabled lack visibility into
  workflow execution details, making it difficult to detect security incidents, troubleshoot
  failures, and maintain audit trails. This creates compliance risks and reduces the
  ability to monitor for unauthorized access or malicious activity within serverless
  workflows.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL statemachine has execution logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
