description: This rule verifies that fault tolerant data nodes in AliCloud Elasticsearch
  Service clusters have encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data stored
  on disk. Without encryption at rest, data stored on Elasticsearch data nodes remains
  vulnerable to unauthorized access in case of physical storage compromise or data
  breaches. Enabling encryption at rest helps meet compliance requirements for data
  protection standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL domains has fault tolerant data nodes with encryption at
  rest enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
