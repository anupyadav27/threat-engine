description: This rule validates that Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations follow
  security best practices including proper network segmentation, access controls,
  and routing configurations. Improperly configured VPC settings can lead to unauthorized
  network access, data breaches, and compliance violations with security frameworks.
  Misconfigured VPCs may expose resources to unintended network traffic or create
  security gaps in network isolation.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GENERAL models has vpc settings properly configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
