description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis clusters have automatic failover enabled
  to maintain high availability during node failures. Without automatic failover,
  Redis clusters may experience extended downtime during hardware failures or maintenance,
  potentially violating SLA requirements and impacting business continuity. This configuration
  is essential for meeting availability compliance standards and reducing manual intervention
  during outages.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures GENERAL redis_cluster has automatic failover enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
