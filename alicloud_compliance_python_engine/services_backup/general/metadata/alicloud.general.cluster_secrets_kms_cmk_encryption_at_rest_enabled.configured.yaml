description: This rule ensures that Kubernetes cluster secrets are encrypted at rest
  using Alibaba Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Master Keys (CMK) rather
  than default encryption. Without proper CMK encryption, sensitive data stored in
  etcd including passwords, tokens, and certificates may be vulnerable to unauthorized
  access if the underlying storage is compromised. This configuration is essential
  for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining data confidentiality in containerized
  environments.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster_secrets_kms_cmk_encryption_at_rest_enabled has
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
