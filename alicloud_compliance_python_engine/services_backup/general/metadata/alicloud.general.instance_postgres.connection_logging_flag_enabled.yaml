description: Ensures that connection logging is enabled for ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL
  instances to track database connection attempts and activities. Without connection
  logging, security incidents involving unauthorized access attempts, failed login
  attacks, or suspicious connection patterns cannot be properly monitored or investigated.
  This logging capability is essential for compliance with security frameworks and
  forensic analysis requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance_postgres has connection logging flag enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
