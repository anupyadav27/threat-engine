  access to specific, authorized networks rather than allowing broad or unrestricted
  access. Overly permissive firewall rules can expose resources to unauthorized access
  and increase the attack surface, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. This control helps maintain network segmentation and follows the principle
  of least privilege access.
