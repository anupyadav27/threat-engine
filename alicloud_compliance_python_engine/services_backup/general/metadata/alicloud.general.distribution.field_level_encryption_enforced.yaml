description: This rule ensures that field-level encryption is enabled for Alibaba
  Cloud CDN distributions to protect sensitive data in transit. Without field-level
  encryption, sensitive form data and API payloads transmitted through the CDN remain
  vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Enabling this security control
  helps organizations meet compliance requirements for data protection standards such
  as PCI DSS and GDPR.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL distribution has field level encryption enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
