description: Ensures that AliCloud Elastic GPU Service accelerator clusters have encryption
  at rest enabled to protect sensitive data and workloads from unauthorized access.
  Without encryption at rest, data stored on accelerator cluster storage volumes remains
  vulnerable to potential data breaches and may not meet regulatory compliance requirements
  such as GDPR or industry security standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL accelerator_cluster has encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
