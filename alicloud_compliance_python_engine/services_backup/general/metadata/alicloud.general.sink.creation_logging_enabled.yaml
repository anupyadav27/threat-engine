description: This rule verifies that creation logging is enabled for AliCloud Log
  Service sinks to maintain proper audit trails. Without sink creation logging, organizations
  cannot track when log forwarding destinations are established, potentially missing
  unauthorized data exfiltration attempts or compliance violations. Proper sink creation
  logging is essential for security monitoring and regulatory compliance requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL sink has creation logging enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
