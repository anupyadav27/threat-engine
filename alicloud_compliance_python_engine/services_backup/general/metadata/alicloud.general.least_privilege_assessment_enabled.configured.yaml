  to continuously monitor and analyze permissions across AliCloud resources. Without
  this assessment enabled, organizations risk over-privileged access that could lead
  to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation attacks, and compliance violations
  with security frameworks requiring principle of least privilege implementation.
  Proper configuration helps identify unused permissions and recommends policy optimizations
  to minimize security exposure.
