description: This rule verifies that ETL job bookmarks in AliCloud DataWorks have
  encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive job state information and metadata.
  Unencrypted job bookmarks can expose processing states, data lineage information,
  and potentially sensitive metadata to unauthorized access. Enabling encryption at
  rest helps meet compliance requirements and protects against data breaches involving
  job execution metadata.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL etl_job has job bookmark encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
