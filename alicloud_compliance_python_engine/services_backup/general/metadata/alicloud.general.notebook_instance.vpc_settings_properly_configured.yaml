description: This rule verifies that Machine Learning Platform for AI notebook instances
  are deployed with proper VPC network configurations to ensure secure network isolation.
  Improperly configured VPC settings can expose notebook instances to unauthorized
  network access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  Proper VPC configuration is essential for maintaining network security boundaries
  and meeting regulatory requirements for data processing environments.
