description: This rule verifies that production variant instances in AliCloud Machine
  Learning Platform for AI endpoint configurations have logging enabled to capture
  inference requests and responses. Without proper logging, organizations cannot monitor
  model performance, detect anomalous behavior, or maintain audit trails required
  for compliance frameworks. Missing logs also hinder incident response and forensic
  analysis capabilities for AI/ML workloads.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL endpoint_config has prod variant instances with logging
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
