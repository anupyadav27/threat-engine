description: Ensures that source repository URLs in AliCloud projects do not contain
  embedded sensitive credentials such as usernames, passwords, or access tokens. Exposed
  credentials in repository URLs can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  compliance violations with security frameworks like ISO 27001 and SOC 2. This rule
  helps maintain secure code repository configurations and prevents credential leakage
  through version control systems.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has source repo url no sensitive credentials exposed
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
