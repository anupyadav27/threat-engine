description: ApsaraDB for Redis clusters deployed in a single availability zone are
  vulnerable to complete service outages during zone-level failures, potentially causing
  data unavailability and business continuity disruptions. Multi-AZ deployment ensures
  high availability and disaster recovery compliance by automatically failing over
  to healthy zones during outages.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures GENERAL redis_cluster has multi az deployment properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
