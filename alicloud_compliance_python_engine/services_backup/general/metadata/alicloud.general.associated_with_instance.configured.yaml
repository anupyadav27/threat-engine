description: This rule verifies that AliCloud resources such as security groups, disks,
  and network interfaces are properly associated with ECS instances. Unassociated
  resources can create security gaps, lead to unauthorized access, and result in compliance
  violations by leaving critical infrastructure components unmonitored and unprotected.
  Proper resource association ensures comprehensive security coverage and maintains
  audit trails for compliance frameworks.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GENERAL associated_with_instance has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
