description: Ensures that Machine Learning Platform for AI training jobs are configured
  with proper VPC network settings to isolate compute resources and control network
  access. Improperly configured VPC settings can expose training data and models to
  unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  This control helps maintain network segmentation and reduces the attack surface
  for machine learning workloads.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GENERAL training_jobs has vpc settings properly configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
