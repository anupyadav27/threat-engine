description: This rule ensures that environment variables in Alibaba Cloud projects
  do not contain hardcoded credentials such as passwords, API keys, or access tokens.
  Hardcoded credentials in environment variables pose significant security risks including
  credential exposure in logs, configuration files, and version control systems, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access and compliance violations. This practice violates
  security best practices and regulatory requirements for credential management.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has envvar no hardcoded credentials properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
