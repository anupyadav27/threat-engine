description: This rule verifies that Express Connect virtual interfaces have redundancy
  properly configured to prevent single points of failure in hybrid cloud connectivity.
  Without redundant virtual interfaces, network outages can cause complete loss of
  connectivity between on-premises infrastructure and AliCloud resources, potentially
  violating business continuity requirements and compliance standards that mandate
  high availability architectures.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures GENERAL virtual_interface_redundancy_enforced has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
