description: This rule verifies that AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL workgroups have encryption
  at rest enabled to protect sensitive data stored in the database. Without encryption
  at rest, data stored on disk is vulnerable to unauthorized access in case of physical
  security breaches or insider threats. Enabling encryption at rest helps meet compliance
  requirements for data protection regulations and industry standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL workgroup has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
