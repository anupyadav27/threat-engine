description: This rule verifies that X-Ray tracing is enabled for AliCloud API Gateway
  REST APIs to provide comprehensive request tracking and performance monitoring.
  Without X-Ray tracing enabled, organizations lose visibility into API request flows,
  performance bottlenecks, and potential security issues across distributed services.
  Enabling X-Ray tracing is essential for maintaining audit trails, troubleshooting
  security incidents, and meeting compliance requirements for API monitoring and observability.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures GENERAL restapi has xray tracing enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
