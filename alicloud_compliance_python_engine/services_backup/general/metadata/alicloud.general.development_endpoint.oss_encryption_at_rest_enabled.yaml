description: This rule verifies that Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets used by
  development endpoints have encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data
  from unauthorized access. Without proper encryption, stored data remains vulnerable
  to security breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as data protection
  regulations. Enabling OSS encryption at rest ensures that all objects are automatically
  encrypted using server-side encryption before being stored.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL development_endpoint has oss encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
