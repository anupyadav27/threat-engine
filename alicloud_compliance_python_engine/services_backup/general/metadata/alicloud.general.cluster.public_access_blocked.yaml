description: Ensures that AliCloud Container Service for Kubernetes clusters have
  public access disabled to prevent unauthorized external access to the cluster API
  server. Public access exposes the cluster to potential security threats including
  unauthorized API calls, data breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting public
  access helps maintain network isolation and reduces the attack surface.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster has public access blocked properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
