description: Ensures that Function Compute functions are protected from unauthorized
  public access through proper Access Control List (ACL) configuration. Functions
  exposed to public access without proper restrictions can lead to unauthorized code
  execution, data breaches, and potential compliance violations. Implementing ACL-based
  access controls helps maintain the principle of least privilege and protects sensitive
  serverless workloads.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL function has public access blocked via acl properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
