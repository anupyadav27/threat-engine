description: Detects AliCloud Container Service for Kubernetes clusters that do not
  have Customer Master Key (CMK) encryption enabled for data at rest. Without CMK
  encryption, sensitive application data, secrets, and configuration files stored
  in the cluster are vulnerable to unauthorized access and may not meet compliance
  requirements for data protection standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster has cmk encryption at rest disabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
