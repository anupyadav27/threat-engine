description: This rule verifies that Container Registry project artifacts are encrypted
  at rest to protect sensitive container images and application code from unauthorized
  access. Without encryption at rest, stored artifacts remain vulnerable to data breaches
  and may fail to meet compliance requirements for data protection standards such
  as PCI DSS and GDPR. Enabling encryption ensures that even if storage media is compromised,
  the artifact data remains protected through cryptographic controls.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has artifact encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
