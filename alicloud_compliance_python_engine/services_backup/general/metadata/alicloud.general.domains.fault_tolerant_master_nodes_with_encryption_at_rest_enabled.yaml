description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes master nodes are configured with fault
  tolerance capabilities and have encryption at rest enabled for persistent storage.
  Without proper encryption and fault tolerance, master nodes are vulnerable to data
  breaches and single points of failure that could compromise entire cluster operations.
  This configuration is essential for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining
  cluster availability in production environments.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL domains has fault tolerant master nodes with encryption
  at rest enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
