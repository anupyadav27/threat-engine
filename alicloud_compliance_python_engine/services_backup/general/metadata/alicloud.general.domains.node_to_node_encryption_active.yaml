description: This rule verifies that node-to-node encryption is enabled for Alibaba
  Cloud Elasticsearch domains to protect data in transit between cluster nodes. Without
  this encryption, sensitive data transmitted between nodes is vulnerable to interception
  and eavesdropping attacks. Enabling node-to-node encryption is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for data protection standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL domains has node to node encryption active properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
