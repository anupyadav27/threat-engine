description: Ensures that cryptographic keys in AliCloud Key Management Service are
  configured to rotate automatically within 90 days to minimize security risks from
  compromised keys. Regular key rotation reduces the impact of potential key exposure
  and helps maintain compliance with security frameworks that mandate periodic cryptographic
  key updates. Failure to implement proper key rotation increases the risk of unauthorized
  access to encrypted data and violates security best practices.
domain: secrets_and_key_management
rationale: Ensures GENERAL key_rotation_90_days_enforced has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
