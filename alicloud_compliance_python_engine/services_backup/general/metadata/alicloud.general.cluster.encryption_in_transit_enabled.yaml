description: This rule verifies that encryption in transit is enabled for AliCloud
  Container Service for Kubernetes clusters to protect data communication between
  cluster components. Without encryption in transit, sensitive data transmitted between
  nodes, pods, and the API server is vulnerable to interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Enabling this security control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for containerized workloads.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster has encryption in transit enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
