  custom role changes in Alibaba Cloud with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without
  proper monitoring and alerting on role modifications, unauthorized privilege escalations
  and security policy violations may go undetected, potentially leading to data breaches
  and compliance failures. Extended retention periods are essential for forensic analysis
  and meeting regulatory audit requirements.
