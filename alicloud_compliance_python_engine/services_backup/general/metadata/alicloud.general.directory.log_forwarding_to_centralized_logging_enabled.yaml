description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Directory Service has log forwarding
  configured to send authentication and directory access logs to a centralized logging
  system. Without centralized logging, security teams cannot effectively monitor directory
  access patterns, detect unauthorized authentication attempts, or maintain audit
  trails required for compliance frameworks. Enabling log forwarding ensures comprehensive
  visibility into directory operations and supports incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL directory has log forwarding to centralized logging enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
