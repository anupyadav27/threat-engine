description: This rule verifies that AliCloud ActionTrail audit logging is enabled
  with a minimum 90-day log retention period to maintain comprehensive security monitoring
  and compliance. Insufficient audit log retention can lead to gaps in security incident
  investigation, regulatory compliance violations, and inability to perform adequate
  forensic analysis during security breaches. Organizations must maintain adequate
  audit trail duration to meet compliance requirements and enable effective threat
  detection.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures GENERAL integration has audit logs enabled 90 day retention properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
