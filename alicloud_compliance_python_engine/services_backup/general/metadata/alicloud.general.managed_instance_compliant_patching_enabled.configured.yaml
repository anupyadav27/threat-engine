description: This rule verifies that managed instances have compliant patching configurations
  enabled to ensure automatic security updates and vulnerability remediation. Without
  proper patch management, instances remain vulnerable to known security exploits
  and may fail compliance requirements. Enabling compliant patching helps maintain
  security posture and reduces the attack surface of managed infrastructure.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GENERAL managed_instance_compliant_patching_enabled has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
