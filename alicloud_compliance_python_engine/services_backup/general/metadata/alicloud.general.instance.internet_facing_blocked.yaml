description: This rule verifies that ECS instances are not directly exposed to the
  internet through public IP addresses or internet gateways. Internet-facing instances
  increase the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  compliance violations. Restricting internet access helps maintain network security
  boundaries and reduces exposure to external threats.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance has internet facing blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
