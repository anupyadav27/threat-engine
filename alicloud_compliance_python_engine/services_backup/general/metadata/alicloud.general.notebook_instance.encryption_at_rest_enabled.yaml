description: This rule verifies that notebook instances in AliCloud's Machine Learning
  Platform for AI have encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data and code.
  Without encryption at rest, notebook data including machine learning models, datasets,
  and research code are stored in plaintext, creating significant data breach risks
  and potential compliance violations. Enabling encryption ensures that stored data
  remains protected even if underlying storage systems are compromised.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL notebook_instance has encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
