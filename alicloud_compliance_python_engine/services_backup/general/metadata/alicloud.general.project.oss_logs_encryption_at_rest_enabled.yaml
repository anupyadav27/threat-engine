description: This rule verifies that Object Storage Service (OSS) access logs are
  encrypted at rest to protect sensitive log data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted
  log files can expose user access patterns, IP addresses, and other sensitive information
  that may violate data protection regulations. Enabling encryption at rest ensures
  compliance with security frameworks and protects against data breaches in case of
  unauthorized storage access.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has oss logs encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
