description: This rule verifies that log metric filters and alerts are configured
  to monitor ApsaraDB RDS instance configuration changes with a minimum 90-day log
  retention period. Without proper monitoring and alerting, unauthorized database
  configuration modifications could go undetected, potentially compromising data security
  and regulatory compliance. Extended log retention ensures sufficient audit trail
  for forensic analysis and compliance requirements.
