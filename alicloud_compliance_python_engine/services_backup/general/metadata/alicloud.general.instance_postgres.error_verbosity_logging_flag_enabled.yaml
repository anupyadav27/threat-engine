description: Ensures that PostgreSQL instances have error verbosity logging enabled
  to capture detailed error information for security monitoring and troubleshooting.
  Without proper error verbosity configuration, security incidents and database anomalies
  may go undetected, hindering compliance with audit requirements and incident response
  capabilities. This setting is essential for maintaining comprehensive audit trails
  and meeting regulatory compliance standards.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
