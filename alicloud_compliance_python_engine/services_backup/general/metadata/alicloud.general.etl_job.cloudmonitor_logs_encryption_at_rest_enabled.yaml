description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor logs generated by ETL jobs have
  encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive operational data. Unencrypted logs
  can expose job execution details, data lineage information, and potentially sensitive
  business data to unauthorized access. Enabling encryption at rest helps meet compliance
  requirements and protects against data breaches from storage-level attacks.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL etl_job has cloudmonitor logs encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
