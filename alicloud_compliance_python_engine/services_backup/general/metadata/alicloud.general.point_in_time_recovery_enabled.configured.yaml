description: Point-in-time recovery (PITR) must be configured for database services
  to enable restoration to any specific moment within the backup retention period.
  Without PITR enabled, organizations face significant data loss risks during system

  regulations and business continuity requirements. This configuration is essential
  for maintaining data integrity and meeting compliance standards for critical database
  workloads.
