description: This rule verifies that AliCloud EBS volumes are configured with encryption
  at rest to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted volumes
  expose data to potential security breaches and may violate compliance requirements
  such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOX. Enabling encryption ensures data confidentiality
  and helps meet regulatory standards for data protection.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GENERAL volume has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
