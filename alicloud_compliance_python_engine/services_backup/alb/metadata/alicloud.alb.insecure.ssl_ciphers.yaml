description: This rule identifies Application Load Balancer instances configured with
  weak or outdated SSL cipher suites that are vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
  Using insecure ciphers can expose encrypted traffic to interception and compromise
  data confidentiality. This violates security compliance standards and puts sensitive
  data transmission at risk.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ALB insecure has ssl ciphers properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
