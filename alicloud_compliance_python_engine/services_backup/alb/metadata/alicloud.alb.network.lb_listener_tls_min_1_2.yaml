description: This rule ensures that Application Load Balancer listeners are configured
  with a minimum TLS version of 1.2 to protect against protocol downgrade attacks
  and cryptographic vulnerabilities. Using outdated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1) exposes
  applications to security risks and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI
  DSS. Enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher provides stronger encryption and authentication
  mechanisms for secure data transmission.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ALB network has lb listener tls min 1 2 properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
