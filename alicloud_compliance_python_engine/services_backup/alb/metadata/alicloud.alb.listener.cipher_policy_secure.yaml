description: Ensures Application Load Balancer listeners are configured with secure
  cipher policies to prevent weak encryption vulnerabilities. Weak cipher suites can
  expose data in transit to cryptographic attacks and may violate compliance requirements
  such as PCI DSS and SOC 2. This control validates that only strong, modern cipher
  suites are enabled for HTTPS/TLS connections.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ALB listener has cipher policy secure properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
