description: Ensures that Application Load Balancer Hologres endpoints have restricted
  CIDR ranges to minimize unauthorized access exposure. Overly permissive CIDR configurations
  (such as 0.0.0.0/0) can expose sensitive data warehouse endpoints to potential security
  threats and may violate compliance requirements for data access controls. Implementing
  least-privilege network access helps protect against data breaches and unauthorized
  query execution.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ALB hologres_endpoint has endpoint access allowed cidrs minimized
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
