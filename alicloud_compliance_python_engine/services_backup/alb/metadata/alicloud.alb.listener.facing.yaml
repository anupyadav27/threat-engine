description: Internet-facing Application Load Balancer listeners expose applications
  directly to public internet traffic, increasing attack surface and potential security
  risks. Internal-facing listeners should be used for applications that only need
  to serve internal traffic to reduce exposure to external threats and maintain compliance
  with security frameworks that require network segmentation.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures ALB listener has facing properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
