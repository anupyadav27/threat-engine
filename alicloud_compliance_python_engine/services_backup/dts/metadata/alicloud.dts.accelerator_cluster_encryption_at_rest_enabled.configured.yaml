description: This rule verifies that DTS accelerator clusters are configured with
  encryption at rest to protect sensitive data stored within the cluster. Without
  encryption at rest, data stored in DTS accelerator clusters remains vulnerable to
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling encryption at rest helps
  organizations meet compliance requirements and maintain data confidentiality standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DTS accelerator_cluster_encryption_at_rest_enabled has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
