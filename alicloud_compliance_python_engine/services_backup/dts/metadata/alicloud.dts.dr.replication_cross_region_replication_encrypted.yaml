description: Ensures that Data Transmission Service (DTS) disaster recovery replication
  across regions uses encryption to protect data in transit. Unencrypted cross-region
  replication exposes sensitive data to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks
  during transmission. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for data protection regulations.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures DTS dr has replication cross region replication encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
