description: This rule verifies that point-in-time recovery is configured for DTS
  table synchronization tasks. Without proper point-in-time recovery configuration,
  data corruption or synchronization failures could result in permanent data loss
  and inability to restore to a specific timestamp. This capability is essential for
  maintaining data integrity, meeting compliance requirements for data protection,
  and ensuring business continuity during disaster recovery scenarios.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures DTS tables_point_in_time_recovery_enabled has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
