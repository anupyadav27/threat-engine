description: Ensures that Data Transmission Service servers have in-transit encryption
  enabled to protect data during transmission between source and target databases.
  Without encryption, sensitive data transmitted through DTS channels is vulnerable
  to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. This control is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for data protection regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DTS server has in transit encryption enabled properly configured
