description: This rule verifies that Data Transmission Service (DTS) tables are configured
  with KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) encryption at rest. Without proper encryption,
  sensitive data stored in DTS tables remains vulnerable to unauthorized access and
  data breaches. Enabling CMK encryption ensures compliance with data protection regulations
  and provides enhanced security controls for data at rest.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DTS tables_kms_cmk_encryption_at_rest_enabled has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
