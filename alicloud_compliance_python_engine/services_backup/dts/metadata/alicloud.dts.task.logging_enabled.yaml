description: Ensures that logging is enabled for Data Transmission Service (DTS) tasks
  to maintain proper audit trails and security monitoring. Without logging enabled,
  organizations cannot track data migration activities, troubleshoot issues, or meet
  compliance requirements for data governance and regulatory auditing. This creates
  security blind spots and hampers incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DTS task has logging enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
