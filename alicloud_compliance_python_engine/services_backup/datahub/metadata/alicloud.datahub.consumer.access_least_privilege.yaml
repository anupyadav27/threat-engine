  necessary permissions to access topic data. Excessive consumer permissions can lead
  to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege access controls helps
  minimize the attack surface and ensures consumers can only access data required
  for their specific functions.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAHUB consumer has access least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
