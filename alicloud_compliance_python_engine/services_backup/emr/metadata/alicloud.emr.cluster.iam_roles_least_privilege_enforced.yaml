description: Ensures that Elastic MapReduce (EMR) cluster IAM roles are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged IAM
  roles can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources, potentially
  resulting in data breaches and compliance violations. This control helps maintain
  proper access governance and reduces the attack surface of EMR clusters.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures EMR cluster has iam roles least privilege enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
