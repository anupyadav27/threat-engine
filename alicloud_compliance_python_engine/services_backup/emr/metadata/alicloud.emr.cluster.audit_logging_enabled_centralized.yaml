description: Ensures that Elastic MapReduce clusters have centralized audit logging
  configured to capture security events and administrative actions. Without centralized
  audit logging, security incidents cannot be properly investigated and compliance
  requirements for data processing workloads may not be met. This control is essential
  for maintaining audit trails and detecting unauthorized access to big data processing
  environments.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures EMR cluster has audit logging enabled centralized properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
