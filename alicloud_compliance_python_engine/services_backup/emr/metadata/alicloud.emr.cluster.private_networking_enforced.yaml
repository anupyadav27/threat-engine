description: Ensures that Elastic MapReduce (EMR) clusters are configured to use private
  networking instead of public internet access. Public network exposure increases
  the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access to sensitive big data workloads.
  This configuration is essential for maintaining data privacy and meeting compliance
  requirements for data processing environments.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures EMR cluster has private networking enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
