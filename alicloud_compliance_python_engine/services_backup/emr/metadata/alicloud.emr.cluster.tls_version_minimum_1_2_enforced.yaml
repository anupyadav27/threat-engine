description: Ensures that Elastic MapReduce clusters enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher
  for secure communications. Using outdated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1) exposes clusters
  to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and man-in-the-middle attacks. This configuration
  is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements
  for secure data processing workloads.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures EMR cluster has tls version minimum 1 2 enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
