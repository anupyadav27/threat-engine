description: Ensures that all ECS instance volumes within Auto Scaling groups have
  encryption enabled to protect data at rest. Unencrypted volumes expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized access and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI
  DSS and GDPR. This control helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity across
  dynamically scaled infrastructure.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures AUTO scaling_group has instance group volumes encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
