description: Ensures that access keys used by Hybrid Backup Recovery backup plans
  are configured with minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged
  access keys can lead to unauthorized data access, backup manipulation, or compliance
  violations if compromised. This control helps maintain proper access governance
  and reduces the attack surface for backup operations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_plan has access backup keys access least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
