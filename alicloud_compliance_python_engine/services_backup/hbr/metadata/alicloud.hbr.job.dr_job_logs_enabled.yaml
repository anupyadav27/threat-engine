description: Ensures that logging is enabled for disaster recovery jobs in Hybrid
  Backup Recovery service. Without proper logging, organizations cannot monitor backup
  job execution, troubleshoot failures, or maintain audit trails required for compliance
  frameworks. This creates blind spots in backup operations and prevents effective
  incident response when disaster recovery processes fail.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures HBR job has dr job logs enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
