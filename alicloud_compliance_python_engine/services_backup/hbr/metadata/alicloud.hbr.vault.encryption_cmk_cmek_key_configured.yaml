description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery (HBR) vaults are configured with
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) instead of service-managed keys. Using CMEK
  provides enhanced security control over backup data encryption, enables key rotation
  policies, and helps meet compliance requirements for data sovereignty and encryption
  key management.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures HBR vault has encryption cmk cmek key configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
