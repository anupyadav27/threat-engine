description: Ensures that administrators with access to Hybrid Backup Recovery backup
  plans have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled to prevent unauthorized access
  to critical backup data. Without MFA, compromised administrative credentials could
  lead to backup deletion, data exfiltration, or ransomware attacks targeting backup
  infrastructure. This control is essential for maintaining data recovery capabilities
  and meeting compliance requirements for privileged access management.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_plan has access backup admins mfa required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
