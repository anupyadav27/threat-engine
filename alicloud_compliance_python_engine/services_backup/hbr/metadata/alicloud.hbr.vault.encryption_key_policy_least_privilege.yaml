description: This rule ensures that KMS encryption keys used by Hybrid Backup Recovery
  vaults have policies that grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users
  and services. Overly permissive key policies can lead to unauthorized access to
  backup data and potential data breaches. Implementing least privilege access controls
  helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations and reduces the attack
  surface for backup encryption keys.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HBR vault has encryption key policy least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
