description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery (HBR) backup vaults are configured
  to deny public access to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Public access to backup
  vaults can lead to sensitive data breaches and compliance violations, as backup
  data often contains critical business information that should be restricted to authorized
  users only. This control helps maintain data confidentiality and meets regulatory
  requirements for data protection.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_plan has access no public access to backup vault properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
