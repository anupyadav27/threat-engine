description: Ensures that backup plans in Hybrid Backup Recovery service follow the
  principle of least privilege when accessing backup vaults through role-based access
  control. Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized data access, potential data
  breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper RBAC
  implementation limits access to only necessary backup operations and reduces the
  attack surface.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_plan has access backup vault rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
