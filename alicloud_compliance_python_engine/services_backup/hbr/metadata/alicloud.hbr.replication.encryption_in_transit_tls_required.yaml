description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery replication jobs use TLS
  encryption to protect data during transmission between source and destination. Without
  TLS encryption, backup data transmitted over networks is vulnerable to interception
  and unauthorized access, potentially exposing sensitive information and violating
  data protection compliance requirements.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures HBR replication has encryption in transit tls required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
