description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery disaster recovery backups
  are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) rather than
  service-managed keys. Using CMEK provides enhanced security control and compliance
  by allowing organizations to manage their own encryption keys, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized data access and meeting regulatory requirements for data protection.
  Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted backups may expose sensitive data to potential
  security breaches and compliance violations.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures HBR dr has backup encrypted at rest cmek properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
