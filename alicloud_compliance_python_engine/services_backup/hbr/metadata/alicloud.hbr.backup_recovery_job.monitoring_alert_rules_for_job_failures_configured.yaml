  operation failures. Without proper alerting mechanisms, failed backup jobs may go
  unnoticed, leading to data loss risks and potential compliance violations. This
  control is essential for maintaining business continuity and meeting regulatory
  requirements for data protection and disaster recovery preparedness.
