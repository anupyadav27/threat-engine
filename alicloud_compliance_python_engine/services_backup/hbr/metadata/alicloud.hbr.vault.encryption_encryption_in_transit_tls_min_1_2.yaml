description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery (HBR) vaults are configured
  to use TLS 1.2 or higher for data transmission encryption. Using outdated TLS versions
  exposes backup data to potential man-in-the-middle attacks and fails to meet modern
  security compliance standards. Enforcing TLS 1.2+ protects sensitive backup data
  during transit and ensures compliance with industry security frameworks.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures HBR vault has encryption encryption in transit tls min 1 2 properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
