  are properly restricted by organizational policies to prevent unauthorized data
  access. Unrestricted cross-account restore capabilities can lead to data breaches,
  compliance violations, and unauthorized access to sensitive backup data across different
  AliCloud accounts.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures HBR restore_job has cross account restore blocked by policy properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
