description: This rule ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery restore operations only
  use encrypted backup sources to maintain data confidentiality during recovery processes.
  Restoring from unencrypted backups can expose sensitive data in transit and at rest,
  potentially violating data protection regulations and organizational security policies.
  This control is critical for maintaining end-to-end encryption compliance and preventing
  data exposure during disaster recovery scenarios.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures HBR restore_job has from encrypted backups only properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
