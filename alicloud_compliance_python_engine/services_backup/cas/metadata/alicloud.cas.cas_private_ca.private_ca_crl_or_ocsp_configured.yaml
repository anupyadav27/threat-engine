description: Private Certificate Authorities in AliCloud Certificate Authority Service
  must have Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol
  (OCSP) configured to enable certificate revocation checking. Without proper revocation
  mechanisms, compromised or invalid certificates cannot be effectively invalidated,
  creating security vulnerabilities and potential compliance violations. This configuration
  is essential for maintaining certificate trust chains and meeting PKI security standards.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CAS cas_private_ca has private ca crl or ocsp configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
