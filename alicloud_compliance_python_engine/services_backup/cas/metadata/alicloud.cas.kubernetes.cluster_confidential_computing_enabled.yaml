description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes clusters have confidential
  computing enabled to protect workloads and data in use through hardware-based trusted
  execution environments. Without confidential computing, sensitive data processed
  within containers may be exposed to unauthorized access, potentially violating data
  protection regulations and compromising application security. This control is essential
  for meeting compliance requirements in regulated industries and protecting against
  memory-based attacks.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures CAS kubernetes has cluster confidential computing enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
