description: Ensures that Certificate Authority Service (CAS) private CA root and
  intermediate certificate keys are stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) when
  available. Storing CA keys in HSMs provides tamper-resistant hardware protection
  and meets compliance requirements for high-assurance PKI deployments. This control
  reduces the risk of key compromise and ensures cryptographic operations are performed
  in a secure, auditable environment.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CAS cas_private_ca has private ca ca key in hsm where supported
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
