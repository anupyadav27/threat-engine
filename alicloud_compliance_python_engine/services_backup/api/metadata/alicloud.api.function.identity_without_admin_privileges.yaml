description: Function Compute service roles with excessive administrative privileges
  violate the principle of least privilege and create significant security risks.
  Overprivileged function identities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources, data breaches, and potential lateral movement within your AliCloud environment.
  This configuration increases compliance risks and may violate regulatory requirements
  for access control segregation.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures API function has identity without admin privileges properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
