description: Ensures that API Gateway endpoints have proper authorization policies
  configured and enforced to control access to backend services. Without enforced
  authorization policies, API endpoints may allow unauthorized access, leading to
  data breaches, service abuse, and compliance violations. This control is critical
  for maintaining secure API access and meeting regulatory requirements for access
  control.
