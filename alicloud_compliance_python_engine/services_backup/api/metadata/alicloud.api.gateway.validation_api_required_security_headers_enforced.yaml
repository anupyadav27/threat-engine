description: Ensures that AliCloud API Gateway validation APIs enforce required security
  headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking,
  and MIME-type sniffing attacks. Missing security headers can expose APIs to client-side
  attacks and compromise data integrity, potentially violating security compliance
  requirements. Proper header enforcement is essential for maintaining secure API
  communications and meeting regulatory standards.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures API gateway has validation api required security headers enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
