  public access permissions that could expose sensitive functionality to unauthorized
  users. Publicly accessible functions can lead to data breaches, unauthorized code
  execution, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper access
  controls should be implemented to restrict function invocation to authenticated
  and authorized users only.
