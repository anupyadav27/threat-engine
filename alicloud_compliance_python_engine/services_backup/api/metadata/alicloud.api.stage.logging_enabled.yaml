description: Ensures that logging is enabled for API Gateway stages to capture request
  and response data for security monitoring and compliance purposes. Without proper
  logging, organizations cannot detect suspicious API usage patterns, troubleshoot
  security incidents, or meet regulatory requirements for audit trails. This creates
  blind spots in API security monitoring and hampers incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures API stage has logging enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
