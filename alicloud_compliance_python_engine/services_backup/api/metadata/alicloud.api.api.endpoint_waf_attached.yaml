description: This rule verifies that API Gateway endpoints are protected by Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) to defend against common web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site
  scripting, and DDoS attacks. Without WAF protection, API endpoints are vulnerable
  to malicious requests that could compromise application security and data integrity.
  Implementing WAF protection helps meet compliance requirements for web application
  security standards.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures API api has endpoint waf attached properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
