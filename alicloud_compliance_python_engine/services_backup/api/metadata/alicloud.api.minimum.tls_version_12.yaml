description: This rule ensures that AliCloud API Gateway enforces TLS version 1.2
  or higher for all API communications. Using outdated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1) exposes
  APIs to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and man-in-the-middle attacks. Enforcing
  TLS 1.2+ is essential for meeting compliance requirements including PCI DSS, SOC
  2, and industry security standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures API minimum has tls version 12 properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
