description: API Gateway application credentials should be configured with minimal
  required scopes to limit potential security exposure. Overly permissive API key
  scopes increase the attack surface and potential impact of credential compromise,
  violating the principle of least privilege and potentially leading to unauthorized
  access to sensitive API resources.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures API app_credential has api key scopes least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
