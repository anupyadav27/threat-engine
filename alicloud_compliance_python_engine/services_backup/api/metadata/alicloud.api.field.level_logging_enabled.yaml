description: This rule verifies that field-level logging is enabled for API Gateway
  instances to capture detailed request and response data. Without proper field-level
  logging, organizations cannot effectively monitor API usage patterns, detect security
  anomalies, or maintain audit trails required for compliance frameworks. Inadequate
  logging increases the risk of undetected data breaches and makes forensic analysis
  difficult during security incidents.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures API field has level logging enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
