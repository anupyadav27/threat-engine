description: Ensures that anonymization outputs from AliCloud Data Management Service
  desensitization processes are properly encrypted to protect sensitive data transformations.
  Unencrypted anonymization outputs can expose data patterns and potentially allow
  reverse engineering of sensitive information, violating data protection regulations
  and compromising privacy compliance requirements.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DMS desensitization has anonymization outputs encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
