description: This rule verifies that Data Management Service (DMS) has appropriate
  data masking policies configured for sensitive database fields. Without proper masking
  policies, sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or financial
  records may be exposed to unauthorized users during database operations. This creates
  significant compliance risks under data protection regulations and increases the
  potential for data breaches.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DMS data_masking has masking policies present for sensitive fields
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
