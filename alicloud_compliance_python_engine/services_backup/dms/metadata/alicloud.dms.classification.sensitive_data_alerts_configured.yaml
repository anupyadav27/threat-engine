  alerts for sensitive data classification events. Without proper alert configuration,
  unauthorized access to sensitive data or classification changes may go undetected,
  leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Proper alerting ensures
  timely response to sensitive data security incidents and maintains regulatory compliance
  requirements.
