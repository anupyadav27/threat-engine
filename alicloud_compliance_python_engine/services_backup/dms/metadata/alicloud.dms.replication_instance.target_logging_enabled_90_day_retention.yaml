description: Ensures that Data Management Service replication instances have target
  logging enabled with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without proper logging retention,
  organizations cannot effectively monitor data replication activities, investigate
  security incidents, or maintain audit trails required for compliance frameworks.
  Insufficient log retention periods may result in loss of critical forensic data
  and violation of regulatory requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DMS replication_instance has target logging enabled 90 day retention
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
