description: Ensures that Data Management Service (DMS) data classification classifiers
  are sourced from trusted and verified origins to prevent data misclassification
  and unauthorized access. Untrusted classifier sources can lead to incorrect data
  sensitivity labeling, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing compliance
  violations. This control is essential for maintaining data governance standards
  and regulatory compliance in cloud environments.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DMS classification has classifier source trusted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
