description: Ensures that Data Management Service (DMS) compliance export destinations
  are configured to use private network endpoints rather than public internet connections.
  Public export destinations expose sensitive compliance data to potential interception
  and unauthorized access during transit. This configuration helps maintain data confidentiality
  and meets regulatory requirements for secure data handling.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DMS compliance_pack_data has compliance export destinations private
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
