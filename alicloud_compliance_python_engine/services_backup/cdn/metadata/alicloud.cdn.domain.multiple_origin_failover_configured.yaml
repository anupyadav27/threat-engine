description: Ensures CDN domains have multiple origin servers configured with proper
  failover mechanisms to maintain service availability and prevent single points of
  failure. Without multiple origin failover, CDN services become vulnerable to origin
  server outages, potentially causing service disruptions that impact business continuity
  and may violate availability compliance requirements. This configuration is essential
  for maintaining high availability and meeting enterprise-grade reliability standards.

rationale: Ensures CDN domain has multiple origin failover configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
