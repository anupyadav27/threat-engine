  from being cached at edge locations. Caching sensitive headers like Authorization,
  Cookie, or custom authentication tokens can lead to unauthorized access and data
  exposure across different users. This misconfiguration violates data privacy regulations
  and creates significant security vulnerabilities in web applications.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CDN edge has cache policy no sensitive headers cached properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
