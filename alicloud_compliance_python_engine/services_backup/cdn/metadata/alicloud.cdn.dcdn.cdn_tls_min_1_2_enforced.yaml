description: This rule ensures that Alibaba Cloud DCDN services enforce a minimum
  TLS version of 1.2 to protect data in transit. Using outdated TLS versions (1.0
  or 1.1) exposes applications to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Enforcing TLS 1.2+ is essential for compliance with security standards
  like PCI DSS and helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity for CDN-delivered
  content.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CDN dcdn has cdn tls min 1 2 enforced properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
