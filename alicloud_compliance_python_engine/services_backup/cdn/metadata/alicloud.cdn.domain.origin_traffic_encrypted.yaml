description: This rule ensures that CDN domains are configured with encrypted communication
  between edge nodes and origin servers. Unencrypted origin traffic exposes sensitive
  data to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks during transmission. Enabling
  origin traffic encryption is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and
  meeting compliance requirements for data protection standards.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CDN domain has origin traffic encrypted properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
