description: This rule verifies that HSTS is enabled for DCDN domains to enforce secure
  HTTPS connections and prevent protocol downgrade attacks. Without HSTS, applications
  are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and SSL stripping, potentially exposing
  sensitive data in transit. Enabling HSTS helps meet compliance requirements for
  data protection standards like PCI DSS and GDPR.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CDN dcdn has cdn hsts enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
