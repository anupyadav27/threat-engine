description: This rule ensures that CDN distributions use TLS 1.2 or higher protocols
  when communicating with origin servers to prevent data interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Using outdated TLS versions exposes sensitive data in transit and may violate
  compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and SOC 2. Proper TLS configuration maintains
  data integrity and confidentiality between CDN edge nodes and origin infrastructure.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CDN distribution has origin traffic encrypted tls1 2 or higher
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
