description: Ensures that DCDN origin servers have proper access restrictions configured
  to prevent unauthorized direct access bypassing the CDN. Unrestricted origin access
  can expose backend servers to DDoS attacks, data breaches, and compliance violations
  by allowing attackers to bypass CDN security controls and caching mechanisms.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CDN dcdn has cdn origin access restricted properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
