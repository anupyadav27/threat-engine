  to protect sensitive data in transit. Without field-level encryption, sensitive
  form data and API payloads transmitted through the CDN remain vulnerable to interception
  and unauthorized access. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for handling sensitive information.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CDN domain has field level encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
