description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud CDN distributions are configured to enforce
  TLS 1.2 or higher protocols for secure data transmission. Using outdated TLS versions
  like 1.0 or 1.1 exposes applications to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and
  may result in compliance violations with security standards such as PCI DSS. This
  configuration protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures encrypted communications
  meet modern security requirements.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CDN distribution has tls1 2 or higher enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
