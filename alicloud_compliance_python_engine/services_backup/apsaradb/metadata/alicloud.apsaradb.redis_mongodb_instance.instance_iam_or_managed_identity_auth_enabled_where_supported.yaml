description: This rule ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis and MongoDB instances utilize
  IAM authentication or managed identity authentication mechanisms when available.
  Enabling these authentication methods provides centralized access control, reduces
  credential management overhead, and enhances security by eliminating the need for
  hardcoded passwords. Non-compliance increases the risk of unauthorized database
  access and credential-based attacks.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARADB redis_mongodb_instance has instance iam or managed identity
  auth enabled where supported properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
