description: Ensures that ApsaraDB RDS instances are not accessible from the public
  internet to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access exposes
  database instances to potential security threats and may violate compliance requirements
  for data protection. Disabling public access forces connections through private
  networks or VPN tunnels, significantly reducing the attack surface.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARADB instance has public access disabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
