description: This rule ensures that ApsaraDB for MongoDB clusters implement encryption
  at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed
  keys. Using CMEK provides enhanced security control over encryption keys, reduces
  risks of unauthorized data access, and helps meet compliance requirements for data
  protection standards such as GDPR and SOC 2. Without CMEK, organizations have limited
  control over key rotation, access policies, and audit trails for their encrypted
  database data.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures APSARADB mongodb_cluster has cluster encryption at rest cmek properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
