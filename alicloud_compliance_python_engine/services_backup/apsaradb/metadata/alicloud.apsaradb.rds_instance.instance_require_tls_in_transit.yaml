description: Ensures that ApsaraDB RDS instances enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all
  client connections to protect sensitive data during transmission. Without TLS encryption,
  database communications are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.
  This requirement is essential for compliance with data protection regulations and
  maintaining confidentiality of database traffic.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures APSARADB rds_instance has instance require tls in transit properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
