description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for MongoDB clusters are configured to use private
  networking only, preventing direct internet access to database instances. This configuration
  reduces the attack surface by restricting database connectivity to internal networks
  and VPCs, helping prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Enforcing private
  networking is essential for compliance with data protection regulations and security
  best practices.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures APSARADB mongodb_cluster has cluster private networking enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
