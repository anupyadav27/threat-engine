description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis and MongoDB instances have TLS encryption
  enabled for data in transit to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Unencrypted database connections expose sensitive data during transmission
  and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Enabling TLS encryption
  secures client-server communications and maintains data confidentiality.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures APSARADB redis_mongodb_instance has instance require tls in transit
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
