description: Ensures that ApsaraDB RDS instances are not accessible from the public
  internet to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access exposes
  database instances to potential attacks and may violate compliance requirements
  for data protection and network security standards.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARADB rds_instance has instance public access disabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
