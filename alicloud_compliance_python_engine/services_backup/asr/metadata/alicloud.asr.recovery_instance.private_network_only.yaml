description: This rule ensures that Application Service Recovery instances are configured
  to use private network connectivity exclusively, preventing exposure to public internet
  access. Public network exposure increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized
  access to recovery infrastructure. Implementing private network-only access helps
  maintain compliance with data protection regulations and reduces security vulnerabilities
  during disaster recovery operations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures ASR recovery_instance has private network only properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
