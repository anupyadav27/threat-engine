description: This rule ensures that disaster recovery source agents communicate with
  ASR services using TLS encryption to protect data in transit. Unencrypted communication
  between DR agents and services exposes sensitive backup data and system information
  to potential interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. This requirement is essential
  for maintaining data confidentiality during disaster recovery operations and meeting
  compliance standards for data protection.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ASR source_server has dr source agent to service tls required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
