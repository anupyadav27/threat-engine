description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for disaster recovery drill
  tests in AliCloud ASR service. Without proper logging of DR drill activities, organizations
  cannot track test execution, analyze recovery performance, or maintain audit trails
  required for compliance frameworks. Missing test logs create blind spots in disaster
  recovery validation and prevent effective incident response planning.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ASR dr_drills_tests has testing logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
