description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Serverless Workflow state
  machines to capture execution details and workflow events. Without proper logging,
  organizations lose visibility into workflow execution patterns, cannot perform effective
  troubleshooting, and may fail to meet audit and compliance requirements. Enabling
  logging is essential for security monitoring, forensic analysis, and maintaining
  operational transparency.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures FNF statemachine has logging enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
