description: Ensures that Container Registry replication rules have encryption enabled
  when replicating container images across different regions. Unencrypted cross-region
  replication exposes container images and sensitive application data to potential
  interception during transit, violating data protection compliance requirements.
  This control is essential for maintaining confidentiality of containerized applications
  and meeting regulatory standards for data in transit.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures CR replication_rule has registry replication cross region encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
