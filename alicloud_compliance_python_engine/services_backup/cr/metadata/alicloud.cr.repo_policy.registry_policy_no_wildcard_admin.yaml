description: Ensures that Container Registry repository policies do not use wildcard
  (*) patterns when granting administrative permissions to users or roles. Wildcard
  admin permissions create excessive privilege escalation risks and violate the principle
  of least privilege, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive container
  images and registry operations. This misconfiguration can lead to compliance violations
  and security breaches in containerized environments.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CR repo_policy has registry policy no wildcard admin properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
