description: This rule ensures that vulnerability scanning is enabled for container
  images in AliCloud Container Registry. Without vulnerability scanning, container
  images may contain known security vulnerabilities, malware, or outdated packages
  that could be exploited by attackers. Enabling vulnerability scanning helps maintain
  compliance with security frameworks and reduces the risk of deploying compromised
  container images to production environments.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures CR container has vulnerability scanning enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
