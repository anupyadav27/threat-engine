description: Ensures that vulnerability scanning is enabled for Container Registry
  repositories to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in container images.
  Without scanning enabled, malicious code or known vulnerabilities in container images
  may go undetected, potentially compromising application security and failing compliance
  requirements for secure container deployment practices.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CR repository has scanning enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
