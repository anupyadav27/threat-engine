  as private or have appropriate access restrictions to prevent unauthorized access
  to container images. Public repositories can expose sensitive application code,
  secrets, or proprietary software to unauthorized users, potentially leading to intellectual
  property theft or security vulnerabilities. Proper access controls ensure compliance
  with data protection requirements and maintain container image confidentiality.
