description: Ensures that Container Registry repositories have either immutable tags
  enabled or image signing enforced to prevent unauthorized image modifications. Without
  these protections, malicious actors could overwrite existing image tags with compromised
  versions, leading to supply chain attacks and deployment of untrusted container
  images. This control is essential for maintaining container image integrity and
  meeting compliance requirements for secure software delivery pipelines.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures CR repository has registry immutable tags or signing enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
