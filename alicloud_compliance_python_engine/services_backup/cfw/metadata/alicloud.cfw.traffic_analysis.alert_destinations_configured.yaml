description: Ensures that Cloud Firewall traffic analysis has proper alert destinations
  configured to receive security notifications and threat detection alerts. Without
  configured alert destinations, security teams may miss critical security events,
  network anomalies, and potential threats, leading to delayed incident response and
  compliance violations. This configuration is essential for maintaining security
  monitoring capabilities and meeting regulatory requirements for security event logging
  and notification.
