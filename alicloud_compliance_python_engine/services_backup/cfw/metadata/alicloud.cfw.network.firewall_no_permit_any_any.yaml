description: Ensures that AliCloud Cloud Firewall does not contain overly permissive
  rules that allow all traffic from any source to any destination. Such rules create
  significant security vulnerabilities by bypassing firewall protections and can lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations with security frameworks
  like ISO 27001 and SOC 2.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CFW network has firewall no permit any any properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
