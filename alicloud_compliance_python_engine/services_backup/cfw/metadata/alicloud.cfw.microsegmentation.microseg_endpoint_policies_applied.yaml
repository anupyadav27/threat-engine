description: Verifies that microsegmentation endpoint policies are properly applied
  in AliCloud Cloud Firewall to enforce granular network access controls. Missing
  or unapplied endpoint policies can create security gaps allowing unauthorized lateral
  movement and potential data breaches. This control is essential for maintaining
  zero-trust network architecture and meeting compliance requirements for network
  segmentation.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CFW microsegmentation has microseg endpoint policies applied properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
