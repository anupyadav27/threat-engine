description: This rule verifies that Cloud Firewall access control policy configurations
  are stored with encryption enabled. Unencrypted policy storage exposes sensitive
  firewall rules and network access configurations to potential unauthorized access,
  creating compliance violations and security risks. Proper encryption of policy data
  ensures confidentiality of network security configurations and meets regulatory
  requirements for data protection.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CFW policy has access control policy store encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
