description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for AliCloud Cloud Firewall
  to capture network traffic and security events. Without proper firewall logging,
  organizations cannot monitor security incidents, investigate breaches, or maintain
  audit trails required for compliance frameworks. Disabled logging creates blind
  spots in network security monitoring and prevents effective incident response.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures CFW network has firewall logging enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
