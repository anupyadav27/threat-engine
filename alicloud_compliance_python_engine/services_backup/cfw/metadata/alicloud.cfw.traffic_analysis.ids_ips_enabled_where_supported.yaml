description: This rule verifies that Cloud Firewall's Intrusion Detection and Prevention
  System (IDS/IPS) is enabled for traffic analysis capabilities where the feature
  is supported. Disabling IDS/IPS functionality reduces the ability to detect and
  prevent malicious network traffic, potentially exposing resources to advanced persistent
  threats and zero-day attacks. This configuration is essential for maintaining comprehensive
  network security monitoring and meeting compliance requirements for threat detection.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CFW traffic_analysis has ids ips enabled where supported properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
