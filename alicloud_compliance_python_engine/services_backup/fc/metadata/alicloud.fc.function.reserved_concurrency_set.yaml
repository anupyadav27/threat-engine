description: Function Compute functions without reserved concurrency settings may
  experience unpredictable performance and resource consumption, potentially leading
  to service disruptions or unexpected costs. Configuring reserved concurrency ensures
  predictable execution capacity and helps maintain compliance with resource governance
  policies. This control is essential for production workloads requiring consistent
  performance and cost management.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures FC function has reserved concurrency set properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
