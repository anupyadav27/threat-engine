description: Function Compute functions deployed in a single availability zone create
  a single point of failure that can impact service availability during zone outages.
  Multi-AZ deployment ensures high availability and disaster recovery compliance by
  distributing function instances across multiple zones within the VPC configuration.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures FC function has vpc multi az deployment properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
