description: Ensures that Function Compute function invoke API operations are logged
  through ActionTrail with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without proper logging
  and retention, organizations cannot effectively monitor function invocations, detect
  unauthorized access, or maintain audit trails required for security investigations
  and compliance frameworks. This creates blind spots in security monitoring and may
  violate regulatory requirements for audit log retention.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures FC function has invoke api operations actiontrail logging enabled
  with 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
