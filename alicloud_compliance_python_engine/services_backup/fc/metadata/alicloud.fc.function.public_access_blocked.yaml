description: Ensures that Function Compute functions are not publicly accessible to
  prevent unauthorized execution and potential data exposure. Public access to functions
  can lead to security vulnerabilities, unexpected costs from malicious invocations,
  and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures FC function has public access blocked properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
