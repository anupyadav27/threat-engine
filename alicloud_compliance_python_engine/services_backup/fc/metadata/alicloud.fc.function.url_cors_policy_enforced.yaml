description: Ensures that Function Compute functions with HTTP triggers have proper
  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies configured. Without proper CORS policies,
  functions may be vulnerable to cross-origin attacks and unauthorized access from
  malicious websites. This control helps maintain secure API boundaries and prevents
  potential data exposure through improper cross-origin requests.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures FC function has url cors policy enforced properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
