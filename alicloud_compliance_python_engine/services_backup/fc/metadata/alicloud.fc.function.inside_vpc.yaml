description: Function Compute functions deployed outside of VPC are accessible from
  the public internet and lack network-level security controls. Deploying functions
  inside VPC provides network isolation, enables private communication with other
  cloud resources, and allows implementation of security groups and network access
  control policies. This configuration is essential for compliance with data protection
  regulations and enterprise security standards.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures FC function has inside vpc properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
