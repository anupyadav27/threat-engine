description: This rule verifies that Function Compute functions are configured to
  block public access by restricting anonymous invocations. Functions with public
  access enabled can be invoked by anyone without authentication, potentially exposing
  sensitive business logic and creating security vulnerabilities. Proper access control
  configuration ensures compliance with security frameworks and prevents unauthorized
  function execution.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures FC function_public_access_blocked has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
