description: Function Compute functions must undergo dependency scanning to identify
  known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and packages. Vulnerable dependencies
  can expose functions to security exploits, data breaches, and compliance violations.
  Regular dependency scanning helps maintain secure serverless applications and meets
  security compliance requirements.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures FC function has dependency scan passed properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
