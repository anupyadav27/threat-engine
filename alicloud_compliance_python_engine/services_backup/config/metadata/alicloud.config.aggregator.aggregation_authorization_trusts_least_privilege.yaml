  minimal necessary permissions to prevent unauthorized access to configuration data
  across accounts. Overly permissive aggregation authorizations can expose sensitive
  configuration information and compliance data to unintended parties. This control
  helps maintain data confidentiality and supports compliance with security frameworks
  requiring least privilege access controls.
