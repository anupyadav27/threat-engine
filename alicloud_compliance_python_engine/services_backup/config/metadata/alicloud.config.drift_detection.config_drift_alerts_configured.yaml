  configured to monitor configuration changes across cloud resources. Without proper
  drift detection alerts, unauthorized or unintended configuration changes may go
  unnoticed, leading to security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and potential
  data breaches. This control is essential for maintaining security baselines and
  meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
