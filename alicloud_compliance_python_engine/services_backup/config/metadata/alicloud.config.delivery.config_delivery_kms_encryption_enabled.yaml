description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Config delivery channels use KMS encryption
  to protect configuration data in transit and at rest. Without KMS encryption, sensitive
  configuration information and compliance data could be exposed to unauthorized access,
  potentially leading to security breaches and regulatory compliance violations. Enabling
  KMS encryption ensures that configuration snapshots and history files are properly
  protected according to security best practices.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CONFIG delivery has config delivery kms encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
