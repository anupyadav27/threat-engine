  across all available regions to maintain comprehensive resource configuration tracking.
  Without multi-region recorder coverage, configuration changes and compliance violations
  in unmonitored regions may go undetected, creating security blind spots and potential
  compliance gaps. This requirement is essential for maintaining complete visibility
  into resource configurations and ensuring consistent security posture across your
  entire AliCloud infrastructure.
