description: Ensures that Config delivery channels are configured with minimal necessary
  permissions to access destination resources such as OSS buckets or Log Service projects.
  Excessive permissions increase the risk of unauthorized data access and potential
  security breaches. Proper least privilege configuration helps maintain compliance
  with security frameworks and reduces the attack surface.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CONFIG delivery_channel has destination access least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
