description: Ensures that AliCloud Config drift detection is enabled for critical
  infrastructure resources to monitor unauthorized configuration changes. Without
  drift detection, security misconfigurations and compliance violations may go undetected,
  potentially exposing sensitive resources to security threats. This control is essential
  for maintaining infrastructure integrity and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures CONFIG drift_detection has config drift critical resources drift
  detection enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
