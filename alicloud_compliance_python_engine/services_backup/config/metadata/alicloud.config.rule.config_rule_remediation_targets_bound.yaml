description: Ensures that AliCloud Config rules have remediation targets properly
  bound to enable automated compliance correction. Without bound remediation targets,
  non-compliant resources cannot be automatically corrected, leading to prolonged
  security vulnerabilities and compliance violations. This creates operational overhead
  and increases the risk of security incidents due to unaddressed configuration drift.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CONFIG rule has config rule remediation targets bound properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
