description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Config Service rules are properly enabled
  to continuously monitor and evaluate resource configurations against compliance
  requirements. Disabled config rules create security blind spots that can lead to
  undetected misconfigurations and compliance violations. Organizations may fail to
  meet regulatory requirements and miss critical security issues without active configuration
  monitoring.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CONFIG rule has config rule rules enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
