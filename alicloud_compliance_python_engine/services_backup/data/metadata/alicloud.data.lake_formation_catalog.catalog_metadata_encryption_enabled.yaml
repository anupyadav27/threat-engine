  to protect sensitive data schema and structure information. Unencrypted catalog
  metadata exposes database schemas, table structures, and data lineage information
  to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  This control is essential for meeting data protection regulations and maintaining
  confidentiality of data lake assets.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
