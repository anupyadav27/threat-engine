description: Ensures that ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ queues have encryption at rest enabled
  to protect sensitive message data from unauthorized access. Without encryption at
  rest, message data stored in queues remains vulnerable to data breaches and may
  fail to meet compliance requirements for data protection standards such as PCI DSS
  and GDPR. Enabling encryption at rest provides an additional security layer by encrypting
  stored messages using AliCloud's managed encryption keys.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ queue has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
