description: Ensures ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ queues are configured to accept connections
  only from private networks when this feature is available. Public network access
  exposes message queues to potential unauthorized access and data interception risks.
  This configuration helps maintain compliance with data protection requirements and
  reduces the attack surface for message queue infrastructure.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ queue has private network only where supported properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
