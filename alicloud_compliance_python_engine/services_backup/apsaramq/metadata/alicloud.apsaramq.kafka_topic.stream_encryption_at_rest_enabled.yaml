description: Ensures that ApsaraMQ for Apache Kafka topics have encryption at rest
  enabled to protect sensitive message data stored on disk. Without encryption at
  rest, Kafka topic data remains vulnerable to unauthorized access from storage-level
  attacks and may violate data protection compliance requirements. Enabling this feature
  helps maintain data confidentiality and meets security standards for message queue
  services.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ kafka_topic has stream encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
