description: Ensures that ApsaraMQ for Kafka connectors have SSL/TLS encryption enabled
  for data transmission. Without in-transit encryption, sensitive data flowing through
  connectors is vulnerable to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. This configuration
  is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements
  for data protection standards.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ connector has in transit encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
