description: Ensures ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ clusters use Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
  for encryption at rest instead of service-managed keys. Using CMK provides enhanced
  security control, key rotation capabilities, and helps meet compliance requirements
  for data protection. Without CMK encryption, sensitive message data may not meet
  regulatory standards for key management and access control.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ cluster has encryption at rest uses cmk properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
