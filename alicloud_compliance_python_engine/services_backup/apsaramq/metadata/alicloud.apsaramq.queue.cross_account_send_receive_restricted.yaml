description: Ensures that ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ queues do not allow unrestricted cross-account
  send and receive permissions. Unrestricted cross-account access can lead to unauthorized
  message consumption, data leakage, and potential compliance violations. This control
  helps maintain proper message queue isolation and prevents unintended access from
  external accounts.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ queue has cross account send receive restricted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
