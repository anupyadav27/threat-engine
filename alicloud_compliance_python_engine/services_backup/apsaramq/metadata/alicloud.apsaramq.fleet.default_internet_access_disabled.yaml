description: Ensures that ApsaraMQ for RocketMQ fleet instances do not have default
  internet access enabled, reducing attack surface and preventing unauthorized external
  access. Disabling default internet access helps maintain network isolation and supports
  compliance with security frameworks that require controlled network exposure for
  message queue services.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ fleet has default internet access disabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
