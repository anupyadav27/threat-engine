  embedded sensitive credentials such as usernames, passwords, or access tokens. Exposed
  credentials in repository URLs can lead to unauthorized access to source code repositories
  and potential data breaches. This violates security best practices and compliance
  requirements for credential management.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has source repo url no sensitive credentials properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
