description: This rule verifies that group export functionality in AliCloud DevOps
  reports implements proper encryption to protect sensitive development and deployment
  data during export operations. Unencrypted group exports can expose critical project
  information, source code metrics, and team collaboration data to unauthorized access.
  Proper encryption of exported reports is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for software development lifecycle security.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS report has group export encrypted properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
