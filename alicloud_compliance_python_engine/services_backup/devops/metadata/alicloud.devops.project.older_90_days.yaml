description: Long-running DevOps projects that exceed 90 days without proper review
  may accumulate security vulnerabilities, outdated dependencies, and excessive permissions
  that pose compliance risks. Projects older than 90 days should be evaluated for
  continued necessity, security posture, and adherence to current security standards.
  This helps maintain proper resource lifecycle management and reduces the attack
  surface of development environments.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has older 90 days properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
