description: This rule ensures that AliCloud DevOps projects do not allow users to
  control buildspec files, which could lead to code injection attacks and unauthorized
  command execution during the build process. User-controlled buildspecs can compromise
  the integrity of the CI/CD pipeline and violate security compliance requirements
  by allowing malicious code execution in the build environment.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has user controlled buildspec properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
