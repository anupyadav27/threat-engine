description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is configured to log data events
  for write operations on Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets. Without proper data
  event logging, unauthorized data modifications, deletions, or uploads may go undetected,
  compromising data integrity and hindering forensic investigations. Enabling write
  logging is essential for compliance frameworks and security monitoring requirements.
