  is properly configured within ActionTrail to capture and monitor all bucket access
  activities. Without proper access logging enabled, organizations cannot track unauthorized
  access attempts, data exfiltration, or compliance violations on their OSS buckets.
  This configuration is essential for security auditing, incident response, and meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements for data access monitoring.
