description: Detects potential LLM jacking attacks through ActionTrail threat detection
  monitoring, where attackers exploit large language model resources for unauthorized
  computational activities. This security check helps identify suspicious API calls
  and resource usage patterns that may indicate cryptocurrency mining or other malicious
  activities targeting AI/ML services, ensuring compliance with security monitoring
  requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail threat_detection has llm jacking detected properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
