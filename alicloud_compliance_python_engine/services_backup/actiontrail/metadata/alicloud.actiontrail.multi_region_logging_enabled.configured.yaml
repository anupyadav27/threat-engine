description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is configured to log API calls across
  multiple regions, ensuring comprehensive audit coverage of all cloud activities.
  Without multi-region logging enabled, security events and API calls in certain regions
  may go unmonitored, creating blind spots that could be exploited by attackers and
  potentially violating compliance requirements for audit trail completeness.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail multi_region_logging_enabled has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
