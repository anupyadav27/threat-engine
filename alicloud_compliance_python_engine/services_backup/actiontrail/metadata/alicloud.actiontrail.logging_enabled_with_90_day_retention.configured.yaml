description: ActionTrail logging with adequate retention periods is essential for
  security monitoring, incident response, and compliance auditing. Without proper
  log retention, organizations lose critical audit trails needed for forensic analysis
  and may fail to meet regulatory requirements. A 90-day retention period ensures
  sufficient time for security teams to detect, investigate, and respond to potential
  security incidents.
