description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is configured to log Object Storage
  Service (OSS) read events for comprehensive audit trails. Without proper OSS read
  event logging, organizations cannot track data access patterns, detect unauthorized
  data retrieval, or meet compliance requirements for data governance. Missing read
  event logs create blind spots in security monitoring and incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail oss_read_events_logging_enabled has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
