description: ActionTrail should be configured to log management events across multiple
  regions with a minimum 90-day retention period to ensure comprehensive audit coverage
  and compliance requirements. Without proper multi-region logging and adequate retention,
  organizations may face gaps in security monitoring and fail to meet regulatory compliance
  standards for audit trail preservation. Insufficient retention periods can result
  in loss of critical forensic data needed for incident investigation and compliance
  audits.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail logging has multi region enabled management events
  with 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
