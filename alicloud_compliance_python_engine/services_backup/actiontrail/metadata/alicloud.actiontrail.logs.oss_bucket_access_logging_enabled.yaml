  Service (OSS) buckets used by ActionTrail to store audit logs. Without proper access
  logging, organizations cannot track who accessed their audit trail data, creating
  blind spots for security monitoring and compliance auditing. This configuration
  is essential for maintaining audit trail integrity and meeting regulatory requirements
  that mandate comprehensive logging of access to sensitive audit data.
