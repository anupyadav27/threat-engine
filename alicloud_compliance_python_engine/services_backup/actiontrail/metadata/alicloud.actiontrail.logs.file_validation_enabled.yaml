  to ensure the integrity and authenticity of audit logs. Without file validation,
  log files are vulnerable to tampering, deletion, or unauthorized modification, which
  can compromise security investigations and compliance auditing. Enabling this feature
  provides cryptographic verification that log files have not been altered after delivery.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail logs has file validation enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
