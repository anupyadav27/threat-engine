description: Ensures that ActionTrail delivery channel destinations are configured
  with minimal required permissions to prevent unauthorized access to audit logs.
  Excessive permissions on delivery destinations like OSS buckets or Log Service projects
  can lead to data breaches and compromise audit trail integrity. This control helps
  maintain compliance with security frameworks requiring proper access controls on
  audit data.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail delivery has channel destination access least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
