description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail delivery channels are configured
  with KMS encryption to protect audit log data in transit and at rest. Without KMS
  encryption, sensitive audit trail data containing API calls and user activities
  could be exposed to unauthorized access, potentially violating compliance requirements
  and compromising security monitoring capabilities. Enabling KMS encryption ensures
  that audit logs are cryptographically protected throughout the delivery process.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail delivery has channel kms encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
