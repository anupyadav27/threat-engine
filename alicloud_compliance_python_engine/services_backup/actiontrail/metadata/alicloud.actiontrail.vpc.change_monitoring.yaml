description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is configured to monitor and log
  all VPC configuration changes including network modifications, security group updates,
  and routing table changes. Proper VPC change monitoring is essential for detecting
  unauthorized network modifications that could compromise network security and is
  required for compliance frameworks like ISO 27001 and SOC 2. Without comprehensive
  VPC monitoring, organizations may miss critical security events that could lead
  to data breaches or network compromises.
