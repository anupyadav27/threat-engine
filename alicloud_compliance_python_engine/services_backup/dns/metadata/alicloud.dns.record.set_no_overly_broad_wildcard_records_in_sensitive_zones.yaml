description: Overly broad wildcard DNS records in sensitive zones can expose internal
  services and create security vulnerabilities by allowing unintended subdomain resolution.
  This misconfiguration can lead to subdomain takeover attacks, information disclosure,
  and potential compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper DNS
  record management is essential for maintaining secure network boundaries and preventing
  unauthorized access to internal resources.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures DNS record has set no overly broad wildcard records in sensitive
  zones properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
