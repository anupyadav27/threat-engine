description: This rule ensures that Alibaba Cloud DNS zones do not use the deprecated
  RSASHA1 algorithm for DNSSEC zone signing. The RSASHA1 algorithm is considered cryptographically
  weak and vulnerable to collision attacks, which can compromise DNS security and
  integrity. Using deprecated algorithms may also result in non-compliance with modern
  security standards and DNS security best practices.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DNS service has rsasha1 deprecated for zone signing in dnssec properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
