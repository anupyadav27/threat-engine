- soc2_multi_cloud_cc_6_7_0013
description: This rule identifies Alibaba Cloud DNS zones that have DNSSEC (Domain
  Name System Security Extensions) disabled. DNSSEC provides cryptographic authentication
  for DNS responses, protecting against DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Disabling DNSSEC leaves DNS queries vulnerable to tampering and can impact
  compliance with security frameworks that require DNS integrity protection.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DNS dnssec has disabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
