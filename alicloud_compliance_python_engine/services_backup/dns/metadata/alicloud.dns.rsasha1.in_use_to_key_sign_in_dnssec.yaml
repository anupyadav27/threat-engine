description: This rule identifies DNS zones using the deprecated RSASHA1 algorithm
  for DNSSEC key signing operations. RSASHA1 is considered cryptographically weak
  and vulnerable to collision attacks, potentially allowing DNS spoofing and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Organizations should migrate to stronger algorithms like RSASHA256 or ECDSAP256SHA256
  to maintain DNS security integrity and meet modern cryptographic standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DNS rsasha1 has in use to key sign in dnssec properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
