description: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) should be enabled on AliCloud DNS zones
  to protect against DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  Without DNSSEC, DNS responses cannot be cryptographically verified, potentially
  allowing attackers to redirect traffic to malicious servers. This control is essential
  for maintaining data integrity and meeting security compliance requirements.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DNS zone has dnssec enabled where supported properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
