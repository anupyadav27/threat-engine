description: This rule ensures that Alibaba Cloud DNS health checks are configured
  to use secure protocols (HTTPS or TLS) instead of unencrypted HTTP. Using insecure
  protocols for health checks can expose sensitive monitoring data and create potential
  attack vectors. Implementing encrypted health checks helps maintain compliance with
  security standards and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DNS health_check has https or tls used properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
