  without proper authorization controls. Unrestricted cross-account DNS zone sharing
  can lead to unauthorized domain management, DNS hijacking attacks, and potential
  data exfiltration through subdomain manipulation. This control helps maintain DNS
  security boundaries and supports compliance with data governance requirements.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures DNS zone has cross account sharing restricted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
