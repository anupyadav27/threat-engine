description: DNS zone transfers allow secondary DNS servers to replicate zone data,
  but unrestricted transfers can expose sensitive domain information to unauthorized
  parties. This rule ensures that DNS zone transfers are either disabled or protected
  with TSIG (Transaction Signature) authentication to prevent information disclosure
  and maintain DNS security compliance.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DNS zone has zone transfer restricted or tsig required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
