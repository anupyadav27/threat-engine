description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters have secret
  encryption enabled using Key Management Service (KMS) to protect sensitive data
  at rest. Without KMS encryption, Kubernetes secrets containing credentials, tokens,
  and other sensitive information are stored in plain text in etcd, creating significant
  security risks and potential compliance violations. This control is essential for
  meeting data protection requirements and preventing unauthorized access to cluster
  secrets.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has secret encryption
  kms enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
