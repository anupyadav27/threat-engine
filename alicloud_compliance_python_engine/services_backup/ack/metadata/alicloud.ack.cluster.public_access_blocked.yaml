description: Ensures that ACK clusters have public access to the Kubernetes API server
  disabled to prevent unauthorized external access. Public API server endpoints expose
  the cluster to potential security threats including unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and malicious attacks. Restricting public access helps maintain compliance with
  security frameworks and reduces the attack surface of containerized workloads.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has public access blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
