description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters have logging
  service enabled to capture and centralize container logs, application logs, and
  cluster audit logs. Without proper logging enabled, security incidents cannot be
  effectively detected, investigated, or traced, leading to compliance violations
  and reduced visibility into cluster activities and potential security threats.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has logging service enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
