description: Ensures that ACK cluster endpoints are not exposed to the public internet
  to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Public exposure
  of Kubernetes API endpoints can lead to cluster compromise, data exfiltration, and
  violation of compliance frameworks requiring network segmentation. Restricting endpoint
  access to private networks or specific IP ranges significantly reduces the attack
  surface.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes endpoints has not publicly accessible
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
