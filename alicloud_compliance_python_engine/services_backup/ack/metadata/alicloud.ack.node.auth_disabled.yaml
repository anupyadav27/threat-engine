description: Ensures that authentication is properly configured on ACK cluster nodes
  to prevent unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server. Disabled authentication
  on worker nodes can allow malicious actors to bypass security controls and gain
  unauthorized access to cluster resources. This misconfiguration violates security
  best practices and can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has auth disabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
