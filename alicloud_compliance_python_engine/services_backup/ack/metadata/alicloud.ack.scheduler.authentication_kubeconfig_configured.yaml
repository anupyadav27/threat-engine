description: Ensures that the kube-scheduler component in Container Service for Kubernetes
  clusters has proper authentication kubeconfig configured. Without proper authentication
  configuration, the scheduler may operate with excessive privileges or lack secure
  communication with the API server, potentially leading to unauthorized cluster operations
  and compliance violations with security frameworks like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes scheduler has authentication kubeconfig
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
