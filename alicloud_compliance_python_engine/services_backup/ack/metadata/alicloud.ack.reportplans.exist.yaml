description: Container Service for Kubernetes clusters should have backup report plans
  configured to ensure data protection and disaster recovery capabilities. Without
  proper backup reporting mechanisms, organizations cannot effectively monitor backup
  status, verify data integrity, or meet compliance requirements for data retention
  and recovery procedures. This creates significant risks for business continuity
  and regulatory compliance in containerized environments.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes reportplans has exist properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
