description: Ensures that admission webhooks in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters
  have image signature verification enabled to validate container image authenticity.
  Without proper image signature verification, clusters are vulnerable to supply chain
  attacks through tampered or malicious container images. This control is essential
  for maintaining container security posture and meeting compliance requirements for
  secure software supply chains.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes admission_webhook has admission
  image signature verification enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
