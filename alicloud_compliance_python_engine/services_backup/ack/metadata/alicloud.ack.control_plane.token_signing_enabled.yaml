description: Ensures that token signing is enabled for ACK cluster control plane components
  to maintain secure authentication and authorization. Without proper token signing,
  service account tokens may be vulnerable to forgery attacks, compromising cluster
  security and potentially allowing unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources. This
  control is essential for maintaining compliance with container security standards
  and protecting against privilege escalation attacks.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has token signing
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
