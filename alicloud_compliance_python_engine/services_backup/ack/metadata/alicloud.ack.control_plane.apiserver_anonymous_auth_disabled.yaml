  server in ACK clusters to prevent unauthorized access. Anonymous authentication
  allows unauthenticated requests to reach the API server, creating significant security
  risks including potential data exposure and unauthorized cluster modifications.
  Disabling this feature is essential for maintaining proper access controls and meeting
  security compliance requirements.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
