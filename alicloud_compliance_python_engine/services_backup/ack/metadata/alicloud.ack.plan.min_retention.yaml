description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) cluster backup plans
  maintain data for a minimum retention period to support disaster recovery and compliance
  requirements. Insufficient backup retention periods can lead to data loss during
  extended outages and may violate regulatory compliance standards that require specific
  data retention timeframes. Proper retention configuration is essential for maintaining
  business continuity and meeting audit requirements.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
