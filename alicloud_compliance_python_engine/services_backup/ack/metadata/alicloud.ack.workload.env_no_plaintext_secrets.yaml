description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) workloads
  do not store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or tokens directly
  in environment variables as plaintext. Exposing secrets in plaintext environment
  variables creates significant security risks including credential theft, unauthorized
  access, and potential compliance violations with data protection standards.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes workload has env no plaintext
  secrets properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
