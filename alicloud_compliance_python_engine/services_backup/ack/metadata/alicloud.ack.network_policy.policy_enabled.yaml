description: Ensures that network policies are enabled in Container Service for Kubernetes
  (ACK) clusters to control pod-to-pod communication and network traffic flow. Without
  network policies, all pods can communicate freely within the cluster, creating potential
  security vulnerabilities and increasing the attack surface. This control is essential
  for implementing network segmentation and meeting compliance requirements for container
  security.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes network_policy has policy enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
