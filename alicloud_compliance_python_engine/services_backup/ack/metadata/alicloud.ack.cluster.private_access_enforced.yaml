description: This rule ensures that ACK clusters are configured with private API server
  endpoints to prevent unauthorized external access. Public API server access exposes
  the Kubernetes control plane to internet-based attacks and increases the risk of
  cluster compromise. Enforcing private access helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks that require network isolation for critical infrastructure components.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has private access enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
