description: Ensures that RAM roles used by Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)
  clusters enforce read-only access to Container Registry (ACR) repositories. Excessive
  write permissions to container registries can lead to unauthorized image modifications,
  supply chain attacks, and compliance violations. This control helps maintain container
  image integrity and follows the principle of least privilege.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes ram_role has acr read only access
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
