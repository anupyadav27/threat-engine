description: Ensures that pods in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters have automatic
  service account token mounting disabled to reduce attack surface. When enabled,
  service account tokens are automatically mounted to pods, potentially allowing unauthorized
  access to Kubernetes API if the pod is compromised. Disabling this feature helps
  prevent privilege escalation attacks and improves cluster security posture.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes pod has service account token
  mounting disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
