description: Ensures that admission controllers in ACK clusters enforce image registry
  allowlists to prevent deployment of container images from untrusted or unauthorized
  registries. Without proper registry allowlist enforcement, malicious or vulnerable
  images could be deployed, leading to security breaches, compliance violations, and
  potential data exposure. This control is essential for maintaining supply chain
  security and meeting regulatory requirements for container workloads.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes admission_webhook has admission
  image registry allowlist enforced properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
