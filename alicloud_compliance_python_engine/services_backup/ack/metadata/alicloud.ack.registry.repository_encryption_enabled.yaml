  container images and artifacts at rest from unauthorized access. Unencrypted repositories
  expose sensitive application code, dependencies, and configuration data to potential
  security breaches. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements and protects
  intellectual property stored in container images.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes registry has repository encryption
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
