description: Ensures that admission controllers in Container Service for Kubernetes
  (ACK) clusters are configured to deny privilege escalation requests. This prevents
  containers from gaining elevated privileges beyond their initial security context,
  reducing the risk of container breakouts and unauthorized access to cluster resources.
  Proper privilege escalation controls are essential for maintaining cluster security
  boundaries and compliance with container security standards.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes admission_webhook has admission
  privilege escalation denied properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
