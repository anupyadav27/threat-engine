description: Ensures that encryption is enabled for ACK vault storage to protect sensitive
  data such as secrets, certificates, and configuration files at rest. Without encryption,
  sensitive container orchestration data may be exposed to unauthorized access, potentially
  leading to security breaches and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes vault has encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
