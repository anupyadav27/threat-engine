description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) load balancers enforce
  HTTPS with TLS encryption for all data in transit. Unencrypted HTTP traffic exposes
  sensitive data to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially violating
  compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Enforcing HTTPS with proper TLS
  configuration protects application data and user credentials during transmission.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes load_balancer has https tls encryption
  in transit enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
