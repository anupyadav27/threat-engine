description: Ensures that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions in Container
  Service for Kubernetes clusters are configured with minimal necessary privileges.
  Overly permissive RBAC configurations can lead to privilege escalation attacks and
  unauthorized access to cluster resources. This control helps maintain compliance
  with security frameworks by enforcing proper access controls and reducing the attack
  surface.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has rbac permissions least
  privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
