description: Ensures that ACK cluster API server endpoints are configured for private
  access only, preventing unauthorized external access to the Kubernetes control plane.
  Public API server endpoints expose the cluster to potential security threats including
  unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting access
  to private networks significantly reduces the attack surface and helps meet security
  compliance requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes endpoints has private access only
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
