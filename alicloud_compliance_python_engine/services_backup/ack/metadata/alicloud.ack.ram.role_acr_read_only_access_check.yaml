description: Ensures that RAM roles used by ACK clusters have only read-only permissions
  to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR) to follow the principle of least privilege.
  Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized image modifications, supply chain
  attacks, and potential compromise of containerized applications. This check helps
  maintain compliance with security frameworks that require minimal access controls.
