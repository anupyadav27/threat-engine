description: Ensures that the kubelet read-only port (typically port 10255) is disabled
  on ACK cluster nodes to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive cluster information.
  The read-only port exposes kubelet metrics and pod information without authentication,
  creating a significant security risk that could lead to information disclosure and
  potential cluster compromise. Disabling this port is essential for maintaining secure
  Kubernetes deployments and meeting compliance requirements.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has kubelet read only port
  disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
