description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters are configured
  with the Terway network plugin to meet security and compliance requirements. Using
  non-compliant network plugins can lead to inadequate network isolation, security
  vulnerabilities, and failure to meet regulatory standards. Terway provides enhanced
  network security features including better pod-to-pod communication control and
  integration with AliCloud security services.
