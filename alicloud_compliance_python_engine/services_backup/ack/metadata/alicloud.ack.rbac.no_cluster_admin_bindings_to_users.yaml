description: This rule ensures that cluster-admin role bindings are not directly assigned
  to individual users in ACK clusters. Direct cluster-admin bindings to users create
  excessive privileges and security risks, as they bypass proper access control mechanisms
  and make it difficult to audit and manage permissions. This violates security best
  practices and compliance requirements for least privilege access control.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac has no cluster admin bindings
  to users properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
