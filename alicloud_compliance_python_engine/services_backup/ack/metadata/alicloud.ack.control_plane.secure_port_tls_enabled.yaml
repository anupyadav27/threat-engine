description: Ensures that the Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) control plane
  has TLS encryption enabled on the secure port (typically 6443). Without TLS encryption,
  API server communications are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.
  This configuration is essential for maintaining cluster security and meeting compliance
  requirements for encrypted communications.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has secure port
  tls enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
