description: Ensures that kubelet anonymous authentication is disabled on ACK cluster
  nodes to prevent unauthorized access to the kubelet API. Anonymous authentication
  allows unauthenticated requests to access kubelet endpoints, potentially exposing
  sensitive node and pod information. Disabling this feature is essential for maintaining
  cluster security and meeting compliance requirements for container orchestration
  platforms.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has kubelet anonymous auth
  disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
