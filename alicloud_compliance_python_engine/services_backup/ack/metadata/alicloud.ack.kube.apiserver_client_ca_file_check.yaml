description: Ensures that the Kubernetes API server is configured with a proper client
  Certificate Authority (CA) file for client certificate authentication. Without proper
  CA file configuration, the API server cannot validate client certificates, potentially
  allowing unauthorized access to the cluster and compromising the security of containerized
  workloads. This misconfiguration can lead to violations of security compliance frameworks
  and expose sensitive cluster resources.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes kube has apiserver client ca file
  check properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
