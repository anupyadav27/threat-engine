description: Ensures that Kubernetes cluster secrets are encrypted using AliCloud
  Key Management Service (KMS) to protect sensitive data at rest. Without KMS encryption,
  cluster secrets including service account tokens, passwords, and certificates remain
  vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. This control is essential for
  meeting compliance requirements and maintaining data confidentiality in containerized
  environments.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has cluster secrets
  encryption kms enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
