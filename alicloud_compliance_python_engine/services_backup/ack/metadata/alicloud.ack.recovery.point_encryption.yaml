description: Recovery points for ACK clusters should have encryption enabled to protect
  backup data at rest from unauthorized access. Unencrypted recovery points expose
  sensitive cluster configurations, application data, and secrets to potential data
  breaches. This control helps meet compliance requirements for data protection and
  encryption standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes recovery has point encryption
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
