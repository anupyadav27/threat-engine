description: Network policies in ACK clusters must be configured with least privilege
  principles to restrict pod-to-pod communication to only necessary traffic flows.
  Without proper network segmentation, compromised pods can laterally move through
  the cluster and access sensitive workloads. This control is essential for meeting
  container security compliance requirements and preventing unauthorized network access
  within Kubernetes environments.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes network_policy_enforced_with_least_privilege
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
