description: Ensures that SSL/TLS certificates used by Container Service for Kubernetes
  clusters are monitored for expiration to prevent service disruptions and security
  vulnerabilities. Expired certificates can lead to cluster communication failures,
  pod authentication issues, and potential security breaches that compromise container
  workload integrity and compliance requirements.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes certificates has expiration check
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
