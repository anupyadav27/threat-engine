description: Ensures that Container Registry lifecycle policy storage is encrypted
  to protect container image metadata and policy configurations from unauthorized
  access. Unencrypted lifecycle policy storage exposes sensitive container management
  rules and could lead to compliance violations under data protection regulations.
  This control is essential for maintaining the confidentiality of container registry
  operations and meeting enterprise security standards.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes registry_lifecycle_policy has
  lifecycle policy policy storage encrypted properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
