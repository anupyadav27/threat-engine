description: This rule ensures that the cluster-admin role is not bound to the system:authenticated
  group in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters. Binding cluster-admin privileges
  to all authenticated users creates excessive permissions that violate the principle
  of least privilege and can lead to unauthorized cluster modifications. This configuration
  poses significant security risks and may impact compliance with security frameworks
  requiring proper access controls.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac_k8s has cluster admin to
  authenticated properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
