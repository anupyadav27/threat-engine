description: Ensures that the default service account in Container Service for Kubernetes
  clusters has automountServiceAccountToken disabled to prevent unauthorized access
  to the Kubernetes API. When automount is enabled, pods automatically receive service
  account tokens that could be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges within
  the cluster. Disabling automount for default service accounts reduces the attack
  surface and helps maintain compliance with container security standards.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has cluster default
  service account automount disabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
