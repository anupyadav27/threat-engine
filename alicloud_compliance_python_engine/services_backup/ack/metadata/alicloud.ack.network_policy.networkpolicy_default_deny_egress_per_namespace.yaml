description: Ensures that each namespace in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters
  has a default deny egress network policy to prevent unauthorized outbound traffic.
  Without proper egress controls, compromised pods can exfiltrate data or communicate
  with malicious external services, violating security compliance frameworks and increasing
  attack surface. This control is essential for implementing zero-trust network segmentation
  and meeting regulatory requirements for container workload isolation.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes network_policy has networkpolicy
  default deny egress per namespace properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
