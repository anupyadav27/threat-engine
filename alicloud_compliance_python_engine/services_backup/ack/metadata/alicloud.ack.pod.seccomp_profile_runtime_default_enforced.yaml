description: Ensures that pods in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters have seccomp
  profiles set to runtime/default to restrict system calls and reduce attack surface.
  Without proper seccomp configuration, containers can make unrestricted system calls,
  potentially allowing privilege escalation and container escape attacks. This control
  is essential for maintaining security compliance and implementing defense-in-depth
  strategies.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes pod has seccomp profile runtime
  default enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
