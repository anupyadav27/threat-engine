description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) service
  accounts do not utilize external IP addresses, which can expose internal services
  to unauthorized external access. External IPs bypass network security controls and
  increase the attack surface, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. Restricting external IP usage helps maintain network isolation and adheres
  to security best practices for containerized environments.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has external ips
  not used properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
