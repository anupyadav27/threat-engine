description: Ensures that container image vulnerability scanning is automatically
  triggered when images are pushed to the ACK registry. Without scan-on-push enabled,
  vulnerable container images may be deployed to production environments, exposing
  applications to known security vulnerabilities and potential compliance violations.
  This automated scanning helps maintain a secure container supply chain by identifying
  security issues before deployment.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes registry has image scan on push
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
