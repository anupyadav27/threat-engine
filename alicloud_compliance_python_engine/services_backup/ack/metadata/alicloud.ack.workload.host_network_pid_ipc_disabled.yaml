description: This rule ensures that ACK workloads do not share host network, process
  ID (PID), or inter-process communication (IPC) namespaces with the underlying node.
  Enabling these host namespace sharing options breaks container isolation and can
  expose sensitive host resources to containerized applications, potentially leading
  to privilege escalation attacks and compliance violations with container security
  standards.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes workload has host network pid
  ipc disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
