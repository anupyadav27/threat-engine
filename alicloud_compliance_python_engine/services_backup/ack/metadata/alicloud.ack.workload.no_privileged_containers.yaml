description: Privileged containers in ACK workloads have unrestricted access to host
  resources and can bypass security boundaries, creating significant security risks.
  Running containers with privileged access violates security best practices and can
  lead to container escape attacks, compromising the entire cluster. This configuration
  increases the attack surface and may violate compliance requirements for container
  security standards.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes workload has no privileged containers
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
