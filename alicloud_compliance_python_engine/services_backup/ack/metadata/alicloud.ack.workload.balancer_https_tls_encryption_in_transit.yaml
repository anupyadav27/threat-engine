description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) workload load balancers
  enforce HTTPS with proper TLS encryption for data in transit. Without TLS encryption,
  sensitive data transmitted between clients and applications can be intercepted and
  compromised, violating data protection regulations and exposing organizations to
  security breaches.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes workload has balancer https tls
  encryption in transit properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
