description: Ensures that ClusterRoles in Container Service for Kubernetes do not
  contain wildcard (*) permissions in their RBAC rules. Wildcard permissions grant
  excessive privileges that violate the principle of least privilege and can lead
  to privilege escalation attacks. This creates significant security risks and may
  result in non-compliance with security frameworks requiring granular access controls.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac has no wildcard rules in
  clusterroles properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
