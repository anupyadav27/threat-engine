description: ACK clusters with public accessibility expose the Kubernetes API server
  directly to the internet, creating significant security risks including unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and potential cluster compromise. Restricting public access
  ensures that cluster management operations are performed through secure channels
  and helps maintain compliance with security frameworks that require network isolation
  for container orchestration platforms.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has not publicly accessible
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
