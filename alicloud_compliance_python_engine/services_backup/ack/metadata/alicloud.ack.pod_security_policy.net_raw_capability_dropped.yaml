description: Ensures that Pod Security Policies in Container Service for Kubernetes
  (ACK) clusters drop the NET_RAW capability from containers. The NET_RAW capability
  allows containers to create raw sockets and perform network packet manipulation,
  which can be exploited for network attacks and privilege escalation. Dropping this
  capability reduces the attack surface and helps maintain compliance with container
  security best practices.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes pod_security_policy has net raw
  capability dropped properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
