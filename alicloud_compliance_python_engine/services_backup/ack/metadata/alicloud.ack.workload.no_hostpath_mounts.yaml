description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) workloads
  do not use hostPath volume mounts, which can expose the host filesystem to containers
  and create significant security vulnerabilities. HostPath mounts can allow containers
  to access sensitive host files, escalate privileges, and potentially compromise
  the entire node. Eliminating hostPath mounts is essential for maintaining container
  isolation and meeting security compliance requirements.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes workload has no hostpath mounts
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
