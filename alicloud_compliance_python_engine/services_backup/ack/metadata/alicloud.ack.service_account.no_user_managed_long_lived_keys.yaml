description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) service
  accounts do not rely on user-managed long-lived keys for authentication. Long-lived
  keys pose significant security risks including credential exposure, privilege escalation,
  and compliance violations, as they lack automatic rotation and are difficult to
  audit. Using short-lived tokens or managed identities instead reduces the attack
  surface and improves security posture.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has no user managed
  long lived keys properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
