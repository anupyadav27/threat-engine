description: Service accounts in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters should
  be configured with minimal necessary permissions to reduce the attack surface and
  prevent privilege escalation. Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized access
  to cluster resources and potential data breaches. This control helps ensure compliance
  with security frameworks that require least privilege access controls.
domain: identity_and_access_management
