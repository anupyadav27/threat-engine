description: Ensures that Elastic Block Storage (EBS) data disks attached to Container
  Service for Kubernetes clusters are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed keys. This provides enhanced security control
  over encryption keys and helps meet compliance requirements for data protection
  and key management. Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted disks may expose sensitive
  container data and violate regulatory standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes ebs has data disk cmek encryption
  check properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
