description: Ensures that ACK clusters have private control plane endpoints enabled
  to restrict API server access to internal networks only. Exposing the Kubernetes
  API server through public endpoints creates significant security risks including
  unauthorized cluster access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations
  with data residency requirements. Private endpoints limit attack surface by allowing
  only authorized internal traffic to reach the control plane.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has cluster private
  control plane endpoint enabled properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
