description: This rule ensures that disk encryption is enabled for ACK node pool storage
  volumes to protect data at rest from unauthorized access. Unencrypted disks expose
  sensitive container data, application secrets, and system files to potential security
  breaches, violating data protection compliance requirements. Enabling disk encryption
  provides an essential security layer for containerized workloads and meets regulatory
  standards for data protection.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node_pool has disk encryption
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
