description: Ensures that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization mode is enabled
  for ACK clusters to enforce granular permissions and access controls. Without RBAC
  enabled, clusters may allow unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources, leading
  to potential privilege escalation and security breaches. This control is essential
  for maintaining compliance with security frameworks and implementing the principle
  of least privilege.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac has authorization mode rbac
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
