description: Ensures that basic authentication is disabled for Alibaba Cloud Container
  Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters to prevent credential-based attacks. Basic
  authentication uses static passwords that can be compromised and do not support
  modern security features like multi-factor authentication or token rotation. Disabling
  basic auth enforces the use of more secure authentication methods like service account
  tokens or RBAC, improving cluster security posture and compliance with container
  security standards.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has basic auth disabled
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
