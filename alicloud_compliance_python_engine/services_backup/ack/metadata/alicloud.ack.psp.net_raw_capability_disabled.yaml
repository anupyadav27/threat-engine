- cis_alicloud_alicloud_5.2.7_0101
description: This rule ensures that Pod Security Policies in Container Service for
  Kubernetes (ACK) clusters disable the NET_RAW capability for containers. The NET_RAW
  capability allows containers to create raw sockets and perform network packet manipulation,
  which can be exploited for network attacks, packet sniffing, and privilege escalation.
  Disabling this capability reduces the attack surface and helps maintain compliance
  with container security best practices.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes psp has net raw capability disabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
