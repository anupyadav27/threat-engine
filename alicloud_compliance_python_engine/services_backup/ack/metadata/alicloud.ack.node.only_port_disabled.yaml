description: This rule ensures that ACK cluster nodes have unnecessary ports disabled
  to minimize the attack surface. Open ports on worker nodes can expose services to
  unauthorized access and increase the risk of lateral movement within the cluster.
  Proper port management is essential for maintaining security compliance and reducing
  potential entry points for malicious actors.
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has only port disabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
