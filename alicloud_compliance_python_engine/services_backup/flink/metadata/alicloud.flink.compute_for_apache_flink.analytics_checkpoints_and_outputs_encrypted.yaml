description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for checkpoints and output
  data in Realtime Compute for Apache Flink deployments. Unencrypted checkpoints and
  outputs expose sensitive streaming data and application state to unauthorized access,
  potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Proper encryption
  protects data at rest and ensures regulatory compliance for streaming analytics
  workloads.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures FLINK compute_for_apache_flink has analytics checkpoints and outputs
  encrypted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
