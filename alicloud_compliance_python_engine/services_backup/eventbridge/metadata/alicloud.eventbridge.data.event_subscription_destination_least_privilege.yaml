description: Ensures that EventBridge event subscription destinations are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged destinations
  can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive event data and potential lateral movement
  in case of compromise. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  requiring least privilege access controls.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures EVENTBRIDGE data has event subscription destination least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
