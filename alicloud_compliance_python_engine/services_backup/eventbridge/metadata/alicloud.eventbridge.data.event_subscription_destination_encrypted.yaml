description: Ensures that EventBridge event subscription destinations are configured
  with encryption to protect event data in transit and at rest. Unencrypted destinations
  expose sensitive event data to potential interception and unauthorized access, violating
  data protection compliance requirements. This control helps maintain data confidentiality
  and meets regulatory standards for event-driven architectures.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures EVENTBRIDGE data has event subscription destination encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
