description: Ensures AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters have automated snapshots enabled
  with proper 30-day retention period to maintain data recovery capabilities. Without
  automated snapshots, clusters are vulnerable to permanent data loss from accidental
  deletions, corruption, or security incidents. This configuration is essential for
  meeting business continuity requirements and regulatory compliance standards that
  mandate data backup and recovery procedures.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster_automated_snapshot_enabled_30_day_retention
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
