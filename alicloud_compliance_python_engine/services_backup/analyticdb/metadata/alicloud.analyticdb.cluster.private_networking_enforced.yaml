description: Ensures that AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters are configured to use private
  networking only, preventing direct internet access to database resources. This configuration
  reduces the attack surface by restricting network access to internal networks and
  VPCs, helping prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Enforcing private networking
  is essential for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining data security best
  practices.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has private networking enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
