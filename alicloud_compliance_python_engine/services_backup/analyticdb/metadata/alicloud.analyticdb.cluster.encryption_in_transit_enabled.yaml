description: This rule ensures that AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters have SSL/TLS encryption
  enabled for data transmission between clients and the database. Without encryption
  in transit, sensitive data transmitted to and from the cluster is vulnerable to
  interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. Enabling encryption in transit is essential
  for meeting compliance requirements and protecting data confidentiality during network
  communication.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has encryption in transit enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
