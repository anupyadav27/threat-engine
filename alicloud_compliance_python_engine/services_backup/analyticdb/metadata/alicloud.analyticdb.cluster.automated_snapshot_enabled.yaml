description: Ensures AnalyticDB for MySQL clusters have automated snapshot functionality
  enabled to provide point-in-time recovery capabilities. Without automated snapshots,
  clusters are vulnerable to data loss from accidental deletions, corruption, or system
  failures. This control is essential for meeting data protection compliance requirements
  and maintaining business continuity.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has automated snapshot enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
