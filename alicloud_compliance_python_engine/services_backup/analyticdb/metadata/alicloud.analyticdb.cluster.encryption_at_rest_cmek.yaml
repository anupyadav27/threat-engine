description: This rule ensures that AnalyticDB clusters are configured with customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed keys for data encryption at rest.
  Using CMEK provides enhanced security control and key management capabilities, allowing
  organizations to maintain full control over their encryption keys and meet strict
  compliance requirements for data protection and regulatory standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has encryption at rest cmek properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
