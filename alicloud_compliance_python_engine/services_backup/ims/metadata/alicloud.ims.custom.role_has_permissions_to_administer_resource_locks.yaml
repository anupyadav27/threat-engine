description: Identifies custom IAM roles that have permissions to create, modify,
  or delete resource locks across AliCloud services. Roles with resource lock administration
  capabilities pose significant security risks as they can bypass protection mechanisms
  designed to prevent accidental or malicious resource deletion. This violates the
  principle of least privilege and may impact compliance with data protection and
  operational continuity requirements.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures IMS custom has role has permissions to administer resource locks
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
