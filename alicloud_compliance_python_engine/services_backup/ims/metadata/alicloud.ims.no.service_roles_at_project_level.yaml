description: This rule verifies that service roles within AliCloud Identity Management
  Service are not granted excessive permissions at the project level. Overly broad
  service role assignments can lead to privilege escalation risks and violate the
  principle of least privilege. Proper role scoping is essential for maintaining security
  boundaries and meeting compliance requirements for access control.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures IMS no has service roles at project level properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
