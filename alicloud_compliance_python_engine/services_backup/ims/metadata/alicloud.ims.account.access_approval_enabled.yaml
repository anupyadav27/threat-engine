description: This rule verifies that access approval is enabled for AliCloud Identity
  Management Service accounts to enforce additional authorization controls for sensitive
  operations. Without access approval, privileged actions may be performed without
  proper oversight, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential compliance
  violations. Enabling access approval provides an additional security layer by requiring
  explicit approval for high-risk operations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures IMS account has access approval enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
