description: Ensures that ARMS tracing sampling rule access permissions are configured
  with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) following the principle of least privilege.
  Overly permissive access to sampling rules can lead to unauthorized modification
  of tracing configurations, potentially compromising application monitoring integrity
  and exposing sensitive performance data. This control helps maintain compliance
  with security frameworks requiring granular access controls for monitoring infrastructure.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ARMS tracing_sampling_rule has sampling rule access rbac least
  privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
