description: Ensures that Application Real-Time Monitoring Service (ARMS) Tracing
  Analysis implements role-based access control with least privilege principles to
  restrict user permissions to only necessary trace data and operations. Excessive
  permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application performance
  data and potential compliance violations. Proper RBAC implementation reduces the
  risk of data exposure and helps meet regulatory requirements for access control.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures ARMS tracing_analysis has trace access rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
