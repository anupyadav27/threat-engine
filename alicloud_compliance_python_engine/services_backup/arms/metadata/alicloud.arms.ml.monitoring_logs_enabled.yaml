description: Ensures that monitoring logs are enabled for ARMS Machine Learning components
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails and security visibility. Without proper logging
  enabled, security incidents and anomalous ML model behavior cannot be effectively
  detected, investigated, or reported for compliance requirements. This creates blind
  spots in security monitoring and may violate regulatory frameworks requiring detailed
  audit logs.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ARMS ml has monitoring logs enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
