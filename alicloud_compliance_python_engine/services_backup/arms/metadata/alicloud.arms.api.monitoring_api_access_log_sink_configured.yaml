description: Ensures that Application Real-Time Monitoring Service (ARMS) APIs have
  proper access log sink configuration to capture and store API access events. Without
  configured log sinks, API access activities remain unmonitored, creating security
  blind spots that prevent detection of unauthorized access attempts, compliance violations,
  and potential data breaches. This configuration is essential for maintaining audit
  trails and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ARMS api has monitoring api access log sink configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
