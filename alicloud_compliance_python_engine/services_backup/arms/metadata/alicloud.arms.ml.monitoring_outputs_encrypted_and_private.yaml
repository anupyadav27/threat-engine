description: This rule ensures that ARMS Machine Learning monitoring outputs are encrypted
  in transit and at rest, and configured with private network access controls. Unencrypted
  monitoring data can expose sensitive application performance metrics and business
  intelligence to unauthorized parties. Proper encryption and private access configuration
  helps maintain data confidentiality and supports compliance with data protection
  regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures ARMS ml has monitoring outputs encrypted and private properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
