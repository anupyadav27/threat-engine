description: Ensures that API access logging is enabled for ARMS monitoring APIs to
  maintain comprehensive audit trails of all API interactions. Without proper logging,
  security incidents involving unauthorized API access cannot be detected or investigated,
  potentially leading to compliance violations and undetected security breaches. This
  control is essential for meeting audit requirements and maintaining visibility into
  API usage patterns.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures ARMS api has monitoring api access logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
