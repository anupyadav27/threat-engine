description: Ensures that ARMS Tracing Analysis trace stores have encryption enabled
  to protect sensitive application performance data at rest. Unencrypted trace data
  can expose application workflows, database queries, and system architecture details
  to unauthorized access. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for applications handling sensitive information.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures ARMS tracing_analysis has trace store encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
