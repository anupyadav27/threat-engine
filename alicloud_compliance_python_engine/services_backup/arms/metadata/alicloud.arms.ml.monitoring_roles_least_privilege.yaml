description: Ensures that monitoring roles in ARMS Machine Learning components are
  configured with minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged
  monitoring roles can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application performance
  data and potential compliance violations. This control helps maintain proper access
  governance and reduces the attack surface for monitoring operations.
