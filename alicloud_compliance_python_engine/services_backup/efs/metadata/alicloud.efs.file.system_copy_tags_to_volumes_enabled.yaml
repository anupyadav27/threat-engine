description: This rule ensures that Alibaba Cloud EFS file systems automatically copy
  tags to mounted volumes, which is critical for maintaining consistent resource governance
  and cost allocation across storage resources. Without proper tag propagation, organizations
  lose visibility into resource ownership and compliance tracking, potentially leading
  to security gaps and audit failures. Enabling tag copying ensures that security
  policies and access controls applied at the file system level are properly inherited
  by all associated volumes.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures EFS file has system copy tags to volumes enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
