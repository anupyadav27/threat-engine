description: This rule verifies that Elastic File System (EFS) file systems are configured
  to automatically copy tags to backup snapshots. Enabling tag copying ensures consistent
  resource management, proper cost allocation, and maintains security classifications
  across backups. Without this configuration, backup resources may lack proper identification
  and governance controls required for compliance frameworks.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures EFS file has system copy tags to backups enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
