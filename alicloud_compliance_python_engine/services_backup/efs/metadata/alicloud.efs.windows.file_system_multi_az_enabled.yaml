  are configured with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and disaster recovery.
  Single-AZ deployments create a single point of failure that can result in service
  disruption and potential data unavailability during zone-level outages. Multi-AZ
  configuration is essential for meeting business continuity requirements and compliance
  standards that mandate fault-tolerant infrastructure.

rationale: Ensures EFS windows has file system multi az enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
