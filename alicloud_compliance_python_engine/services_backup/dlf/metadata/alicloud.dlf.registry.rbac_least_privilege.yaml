description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation registry resources implement Role-Based
  Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege principles to minimize unauthorized access
  to data catalogs and metadata. Excessive permissions can lead to data breaches,
  unauthorized data discovery, and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
  Proper RBAC implementation reduces the attack surface and ensures users only have
  access to necessary registry resources.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DLF registry has rbac least privilege properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
