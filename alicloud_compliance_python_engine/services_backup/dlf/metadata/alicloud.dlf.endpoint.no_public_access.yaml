description: This rule ensures that Data Lake Formation endpoints are not configured
  with public access, preventing unauthorized external access to sensitive data lake
  resources. Public endpoints expose data processing workflows and metadata to potential
  security threats, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with data
  protection regulations. Restricting endpoint access to private networks helps maintain
  data confidentiality and meets enterprise security requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DLF endpoint has no public access properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
