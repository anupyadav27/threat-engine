description: Ensures that MaxCompute partition catalogs within Data Lake Formation
  are encrypted to protect sensitive metadata and partition information. Unencrypted
  partition catalogs expose data structure and organization details that could be
  exploited by unauthorized users. This control is essential for maintaining data
  confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for data protection regulations.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DLF maxcompute_partition has partition catalog encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
