description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation database access policies grant only
  the minimum permissions necessary for users and roles to perform their required
  functions. Overly permissive database policies can lead to unauthorized data access,
  data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Implementing
  least privilege access controls reduces the attack surface and limits potential
  damage from compromised credentials.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DLF database has policy least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
