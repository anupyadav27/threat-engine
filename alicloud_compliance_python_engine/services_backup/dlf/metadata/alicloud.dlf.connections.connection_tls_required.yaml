description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation connections enforce TLS encryption to
  protect data in transit. Unencrypted connections expose sensitive data to interception
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially violating data protection regulations
  and compromising data integrity during transmission between data sources and the
  data lake.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DLF connections has connection tls required properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
