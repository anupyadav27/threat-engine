description: Data Lake Formation endpoints must enforce least privilege access principles
  to minimize unauthorized data access risks. Overly permissive endpoint configurations
  can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and unauthorized access to sensitive
  data lake resources. Proper access controls ensure only necessary permissions are
  granted to users and applications.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DLF endpoint has least privilege properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
