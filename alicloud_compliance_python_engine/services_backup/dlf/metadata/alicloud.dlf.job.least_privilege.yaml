  permissions to reduce security risks and prevent unauthorized data access. Excessive
  permissions can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and potential lateral
  movement within the data lake environment. Implementing least privilege access helps
  maintain data governance standards and reduces the attack surface.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DLF job has least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
