description: Ensures that DataWorks crawlers in Data Lake Formation have their scope
  restricted to an allowlist of approved data sources and locations. Unrestricted
  crawler scope can lead to unauthorized data discovery, potential data exposure,
  and compliance violations by allowing crawlers to access sensitive data sources
  outside of approved boundaries. This control helps maintain data governance and
  prevents inadvertent scanning of restricted datasets.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DLF dataworks_crawlers has crawler scope restricted to allowlist
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
