description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation crawlers are configured with restricted
  scope to only access approved data sources through allowlist mechanisms. Unrestricted
  crawler scope can lead to unauthorized data discovery, potential data exposure,
  and compliance violations by allowing crawlers to access sensitive data sources
  outside of approved boundaries. This control helps maintain data governance and
  prevents inadvertent cataloging of restricted datasets.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures DLF crawlers has crawler scope restricted to allowlist properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
