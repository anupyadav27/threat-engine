description: This rule verifies that Data Lake Formation databases are not shared
  across different AliCloud accounts without proper authorization controls. Unrestricted
  cross-account database sharing can lead to unauthorized data access, potential data
  breaches, and compliance violations with data governance policies. Proper access
  controls help maintain data sovereignty and ensure only authorized accounts can
  access sensitive database resources.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures DLF database has cross account sharing restricted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
