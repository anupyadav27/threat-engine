description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation registry resources are not shared across
  multiple AliCloud accounts without proper authorization controls. Unrestricted cross-account
  sharing can lead to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and compliance
  violations with data governance policies. This control helps maintain data isolation
  and prevents inadvertent exposure of sensitive metadata catalogs.
domain: storage_and_database_security
rationale: Ensures DLF registry has cross account sharing restricted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
