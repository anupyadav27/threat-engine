description: Ensures Data Lake Formation classifiers implement role-based access control
  with least privilege principles to minimize unauthorized access to sensitive data
  classification resources. Excessive permissions on classifiers can lead to data
  exposure, compliance violations, and potential data breaches in data lake environments.
  Proper RBAC implementation helps maintain data governance and regulatory compliance
  requirements.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DLF classifiers has classifier rbac least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
