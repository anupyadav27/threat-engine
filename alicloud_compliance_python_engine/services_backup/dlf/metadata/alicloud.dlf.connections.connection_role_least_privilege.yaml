  minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged connection
  roles can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation attacks, and compliance
  violations with data governance standards. This control helps maintain proper access
  boundaries and reduces the attack surface for data lake resources.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DLF connections has connection role least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
