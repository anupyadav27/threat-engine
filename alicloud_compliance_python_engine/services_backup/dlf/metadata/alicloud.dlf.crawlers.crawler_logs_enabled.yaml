description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation crawlers have logging enabled to capture
  operational events and security-related activities. Without proper logging, organizations
  cannot monitor crawler execution, detect potential security incidents, or maintain
  audit trails required for compliance frameworks. This creates blind spots in data
  discovery operations and hampers incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DLF crawlers has crawler logs enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
