description: This rule verifies that Data Lake Formation crawlers are configured to
  use private network access exclusively, preventing exposure to public internet.
  Crawlers with public network access can expose sensitive data discovery processes
  and metadata to potential security threats. Enforcing private-only network access
  helps maintain data confidentiality and meets compliance requirements for data governance
  frameworks.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DLF crawlers has crawler network private only properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
