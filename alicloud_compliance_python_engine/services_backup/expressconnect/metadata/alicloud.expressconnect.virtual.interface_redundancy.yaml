description: Virtual Border Router interfaces in Express Connect should be configured
  with redundancy to prevent single points of failure in hybrid cloud connectivity.
  Without proper interface redundancy, network outages can disrupt critical business
  operations and violate availability requirements in compliance frameworks. This
  configuration ensures high availability and resilience of dedicated network connections
  between on-premises infrastructure and AliCloud VPC.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures EXPRESSCONNECT virtual has interface redundancy properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
