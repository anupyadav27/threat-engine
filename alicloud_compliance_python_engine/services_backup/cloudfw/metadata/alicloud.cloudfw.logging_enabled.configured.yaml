  AliCloud Cloud Firewall to capture network traffic and security events. Without
  proper logging configuration, organizations lose visibility into network threats,
  attack patterns, and cannot meet compliance requirements for audit trails. Inadequate
  firewall logging significantly hampers incident response capabilities and forensic
  analysis.
