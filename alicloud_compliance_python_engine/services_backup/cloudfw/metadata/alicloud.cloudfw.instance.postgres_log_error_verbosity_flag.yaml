description: Ensures PostgreSQL instances managed by AliCloud Cloud Firewall have
  appropriate log_error_verbosity flag settings configured. Proper error verbosity
  logging is essential for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance
  requirements as it controls the level of detail in PostgreSQL error messages. Inadequate
  logging verbosity can hinder security investigations and violate regulatory compliance
  standards that require comprehensive audit trails.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW instance has postgres log error verbosity flag properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
