description: This rule ensures that AliCloud Cloud Firewall instances are not configured
  to allow unrestricted public access from the internet. Exposing firewall management
  interfaces publicly increases the attack surface and creates security vulnerabilities
  that could lead to unauthorized access, configuration tampering, and potential compliance
  violations with security frameworks requiring network access controls.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW instance has public access properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
