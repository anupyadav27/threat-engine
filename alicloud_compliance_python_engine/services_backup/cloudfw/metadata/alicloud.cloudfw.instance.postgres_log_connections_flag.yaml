description: Ensures that PostgreSQL instances protected by Cloud Firewall have the
  log_connections parameter enabled to track all connection attempts. This configuration
  is critical for security monitoring, audit compliance, and forensic analysis as
  it provides visibility into database access patterns and potential unauthorized
  connection attempts. Failure to enable connection logging can result in compliance
  violations and reduced incident response capabilities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW instance has postgres log connections flag properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
