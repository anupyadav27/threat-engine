description: Cloud Firewall instances should be distributed across multiple availability
  zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Single availability zone
  deployments create a single point of failure that could compromise network security
  controls during zone outages. Multi-AZ deployment is essential for maintaining continuous
  security posture and meeting compliance requirements for business continuity.
