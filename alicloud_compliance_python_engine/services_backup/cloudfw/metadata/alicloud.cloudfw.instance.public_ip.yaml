description: Ensures that Cloud Firewall instances have public IP addresses properly
  configured for external traffic inspection and protection. Without public IP configuration,
  the firewall cannot effectively monitor and filter internet-bound traffic, creating
  security gaps that may lead to compliance violations and exposure to external threats.
  This configuration is essential for maintaining network perimeter security and meeting
  regulatory requirements for traffic monitoring.
