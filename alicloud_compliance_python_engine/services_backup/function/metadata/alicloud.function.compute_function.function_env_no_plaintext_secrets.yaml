description: Function Compute functions with plaintext secrets in environment variables
  expose sensitive data to unauthorized access and potential credential theft. This
  configuration violates security best practices and may lead to compliance violations,
  as environment variables can be accessed through function logs, monitoring systems,
  and by anyone with function read permissions.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures FUNCTION compute_function has function env no plaintext secrets
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
