description: Function Compute functions should be configured to run within a Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure network isolation and enhanced security. Functions
  without VPC configuration are exposed to the public internet, increasing attack
  surface and potential data exposure risks. This configuration is essential for compliance
  with security frameworks that require network segmentation and private communication
  channels.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures FUNCTION compute_function has function vpc private networking enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
