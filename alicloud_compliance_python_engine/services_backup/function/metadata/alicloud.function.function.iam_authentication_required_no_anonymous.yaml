description: This rule ensures that Function Compute functions are configured to require
  proper IAM authentication and do not allow anonymous access. Anonymous access to
  functions can lead to unauthorized code execution, data breaches, and potential
  abuse of compute resources. Proper IAM authentication is essential for maintaining
  access control compliance and preventing security incidents in serverless environments.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures FUNCTION function has iam authentication required no anonymous
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
