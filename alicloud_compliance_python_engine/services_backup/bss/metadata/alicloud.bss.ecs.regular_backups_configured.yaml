description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have automated backup policies
  configured to create regular snapshots of system and data disks. Without proper
  backup configurations, organizations face significant data loss risks during system
  failures, security incidents, or accidental deletions, potentially violating business
  continuity and disaster recovery compliance requirements.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures BSS ecs has regular backups configured properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
