description: This rule verifies that mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption is enforced for
  internal Business Support System services that support this security feature. Without
  mTLS, internal service communications are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
  and unauthorized access, potentially exposing sensitive billing and subscription
  data. Implementing mTLS ensures bidirectional authentication and encryption between
  internal services, meeting compliance requirements for data protection.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures BSS tls_via_cas_kms has encryption mtls required for internal services
  where supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
