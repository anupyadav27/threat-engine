description: Ensures that DataWorks DataMap catalog sharing across different AliCloud
  accounts is properly restricted to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Unrestricted
  cross-account catalog sharing can lead to sensitive metadata leakage and compliance
  violations with data governance policies. This control helps maintain data sovereignty
  and reduces the risk of inadvertent data access by external accounts.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap has catalog cross account sharing restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
