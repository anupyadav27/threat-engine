description: Ensures that DataWorks workflow Data Security Center (DSC) labels enforce
  proper consent-based access controls using role-based access control with minimal
  required permissions. Inadequate privilege management can lead to unauthorized data
  access, compliance violations with data protection regulations, and potential data
  breaches in sensitive data processing workflows.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow_dsc_labels has consent access rbac least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
