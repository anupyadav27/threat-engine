description: This rule verifies that data quality logging is enabled in DataWorks
  Data Quality Center (DQC) to maintain comprehensive audit trails of data validation
  processes. Without proper logging, organizations cannot track data quality issues,
  monitor compliance with data governance policies, or investigate data integrity
  incidents. Enabling data quality logs is essential for regulatory compliance and
  maintaining data lineage visibility.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc has data quality logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
