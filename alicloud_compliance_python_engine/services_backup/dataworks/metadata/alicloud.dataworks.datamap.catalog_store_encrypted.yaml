description: This rule verifies that DataWorks DataMap catalog store has encryption
  enabled to protect sensitive metadata and data lineage information. Unencrypted
  catalog stores expose critical business data schemas, table structures, and data
  relationships to potential unauthorized access. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance
  requirements for data protection regulations and reduces the risk of data breaches
  involving metadata exposure.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap has catalog store encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
