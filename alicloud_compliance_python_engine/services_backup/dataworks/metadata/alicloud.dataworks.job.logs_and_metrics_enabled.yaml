description: DataWorks jobs should have comprehensive logging and metrics collection
  enabled to maintain proper security monitoring and operational visibility. Without
  proper logging and metrics, security incidents may go undetected, making it difficult
  to perform forensic analysis, meet compliance requirements, and maintain audit trails
  for data processing activities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS job has logs and metrics enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
