description: This rule verifies that DataWorks workflow definitions are configured
  to use private storage repositories rather than public ones. Public workflow definition
  storage can expose sensitive business logic, data processing workflows, and potentially
  reveal confidential data sources or transformation rules to unauthorized users.
  Private storage ensures workflow definitions remain accessible only to authorized
  personnel and maintains compliance with data governance requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow_definition has definition storage private properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
