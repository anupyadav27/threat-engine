  DSC (Data Security Center) labels is properly encrypted at rest. Unencrypted consent
  store data poses significant privacy risks and may violate data protection regulations
  like GDPR, potentially exposing sensitive user consent information and resulting
  in compliance violations and data breaches.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow_dsc_labels has consent store encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
