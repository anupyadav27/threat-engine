description: DataWorks Data Integration crawlers should be configured to use private
  network access exclusively to prevent unauthorized external access and data exposure.
  Public network access increases the attack surface and may lead to data breaches
  or compliance violations. Restricting crawler network access to private networks
  ensures secure data processing within your VPC boundaries.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_integration has crawler network private only properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
