description: Ensures that DataWorks data pipelines are configured to use private networking
  instead of public internet connections. This prevents data exposure during transit
  and reduces the attack surface by keeping data processing workflows within private
  network boundaries. Non-compliance increases risks of data interception and may
  violate data protection regulations requiring secure data handling.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS ai has data pipeline private networking enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
