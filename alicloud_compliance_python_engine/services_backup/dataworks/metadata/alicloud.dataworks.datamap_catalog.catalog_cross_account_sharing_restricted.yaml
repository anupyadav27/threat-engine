description: This rule verifies that DataWorks DataMap catalog cross-account sharing
  is properly restricted to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data assets.
  Unrestricted cross-account sharing can lead to data exposure, compliance violations,
  and potential data breaches when catalogs containing metadata about sensitive datasets
  are shared with untrusted accounts. Proper access controls ensure data governance
  and regulatory compliance requirements are met.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_catalog has catalog cross account sharing restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
