description: This rule verifies that encryption is properly configured for DataWorks
  Lake Analytics workgroups to protect sensitive data processing and query operations.
  Unencrypted workgroups expose data in transit and at rest to potential security
  breaches, compromising data confidentiality and regulatory compliance requirements.
  Proper encryption implementation ensures data protection throughout the analytics
  workflow lifecycle.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
