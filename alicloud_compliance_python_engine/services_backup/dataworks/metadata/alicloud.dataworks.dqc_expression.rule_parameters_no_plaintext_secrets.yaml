description: Ensures that DataWorks Data Quality Center (DQC) expression rule parameters
  do not contain plaintext secrets such as passwords, API keys, or tokens. Storing
  secrets in plaintext within rule parameters creates significant security vulnerabilities
  and may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems. This violates security
  best practices and compliance requirements for data protection.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_expression has rule parameters no plaintext secrets
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
