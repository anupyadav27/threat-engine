description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Data Quality service roles are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to perform their intended functions. Excessive
  permissions can lead to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and compliance
  violations with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege access
  controls reduces the attack surface and limits potential damage from compromised
  accounts.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_quality has role least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
