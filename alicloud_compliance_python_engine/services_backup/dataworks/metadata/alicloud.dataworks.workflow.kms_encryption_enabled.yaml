description: DataWorks workflows should be encrypted using Key Management Service
  (KMS) to protect sensitive data processing logic and workflow configurations. Without
  KMS encryption, workflow data remains vulnerable to unauthorized access and may
  violate data protection compliance requirements. This control ensures data-at-rest
  protection for workflow definitions and associated metadata.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow has kms encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
