description: This rule verifies that job bookmark encryption is enabled for DataWorks
  development endpoints to protect sensitive job state information and metadata. Unencrypted
  job bookmarks can expose workflow execution details, data lineage information, and
  processing states to unauthorized access. Enabling encryption helps meet data protection
  compliance requirements and prevents potential data leakage through job execution
  metadata.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS development has endpoints job bookmark encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
