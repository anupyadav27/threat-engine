description: This rule verifies that data lineage export destinations in AliCloud
  DataWorks are properly encrypted to protect sensitive metadata during transit and
  storage. Unencrypted lineage exports can expose critical data flow information,
  table schemas, and business logic to unauthorized access, potentially leading to
  data breaches and compliance violations. Proper encryption ensures that exported
  lineage data meets security standards and regulatory requirements for data protection.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS lineage_data has lineage export destination encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
