description: DataWorks Data Integration crawler roles should be configured with minimal
  necessary permissions to reduce security risks and prevent unauthorized data access.
  Overprivileged crawler roles can lead to data breaches, unauthorized system access,
  and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege
  access controls helps maintain data governance and reduces the attack surface for
  potential security incidents.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_integration has crawler role least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
