description: DataWorks connections should be configured to use private networking
  to prevent data exposure over public networks. Public network access increases the
  risk of data interception, unauthorized access, and potential compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. Private networking ensures secure communication
  channels between DataWorks and connected data sources.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS connection has private networking enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
