description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Data Quality Center (DQC) rulesets
  have encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data quality rules and configurations.
  Unencrypted rulesets expose data governance policies and business logic to unauthorized
  access, potentially leading to compliance violations and intellectual property theft.
  Enabling encryption at rest ensures that stored ruleset data meets security standards
  and regulatory requirements.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_ruleset has ruleset encrypted at rest properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
