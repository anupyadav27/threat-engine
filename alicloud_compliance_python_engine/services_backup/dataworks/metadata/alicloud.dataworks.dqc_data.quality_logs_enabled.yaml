description: Ensures that quality logs are enabled for DataWorks Data Quality Center
  (DQC) data monitoring. Without quality logs enabled, organizations lose visibility
  into data quality issues, compliance violations, and potential data integrity problems
  that could impact business decisions and regulatory compliance. This monitoring
  capability is essential for maintaining audit trails and detecting data anomalies
  in real-time.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_data has quality logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
