description: This rule verifies that DataWorks DataMap data catalog update permissions
  are granted following Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) least privilege principles.
  Excessive catalog update permissions can lead to unauthorized data schema modifications,
  metadata tampering, and potential data governance violations. Proper RBAC implementation
  ensures only authorized users can modify critical data catalog information, maintaining
  data integrity and compliance with data protection regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_data has catalog update rbac least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
