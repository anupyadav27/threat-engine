description: Ensures that DataWorks workflow execution roles are configured with minimal
  necessary permissions to reduce security risks and prevent unauthorized access to
  sensitive data and resources. Overprivileged execution roles can lead to data breaches,
  compliance violations, and potential lateral movement within the cloud environment
  if compromised.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow has execution role least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
