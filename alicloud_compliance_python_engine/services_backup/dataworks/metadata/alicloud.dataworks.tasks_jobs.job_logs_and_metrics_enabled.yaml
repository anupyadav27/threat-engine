description: This rule verifies that logging and metrics collection are enabled for
  DataWorks jobs to ensure proper monitoring and audit capabilities. Without proper
  logging, security incidents and data processing anomalies cannot be effectively
  tracked or investigated, potentially leading to compliance violations and delayed
  incident response. Enabling comprehensive job logs and metrics is essential for
  maintaining data governance standards and meeting regulatory audit requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS tasks_jobs has job logs and metrics enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
