description: Ensures DataWorks DataMap catalog implements role-based access control
  (RBAC) with least privilege principles to prevent unauthorized data access and metadata
  exposure. Excessive permissions in data catalogs can lead to data breaches, compliance
  violations, and unauthorized discovery of sensitive datasets across the organization.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap has catalog rbac least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
