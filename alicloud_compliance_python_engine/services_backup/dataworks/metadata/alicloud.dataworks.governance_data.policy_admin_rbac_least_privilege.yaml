  only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their duties. Excessive administrative
  privileges can lead to unauthorized data access, policy manipulation, and compliance
  violations in data governance frameworks. This control helps prevent privilege escalation
  attacks and ensures proper segregation of duties in data management operations.
