description: This rule verifies that DataWorks rights workflow storage is encrypted
  to protect sensitive workflow data and approval processes. Unencrypted workflow
  storage can expose critical business logic, user permissions, and approval workflows
  to unauthorized access. Proper encryption helps meet data protection compliance
  requirements and prevents data breaches in workflow management systems.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS tickets_workflows has rights workflow storage encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
