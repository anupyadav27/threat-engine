description: This rule verifies that DataWorks parameter objects with secret references
  are configured to resolve sensitive values at runtime rather than storing them in
  plaintext. Runtime resolution prevents exposure of sensitive credentials in configuration
  files and logs, reducing the risk of credential leakage and ensuring compliance
  with data protection standards.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS parameter_object has parameter binding secret refs resolved
  at runtime properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
