description: This rule verifies that DataWorks development environment endpoints have
  Object Storage Service (OSS) encryption enabled to protect data in transit and at
  rest. Unencrypted OSS endpoints expose sensitive development data to potential interception
  and unauthorized access, violating data protection compliance requirements. Enabling
  OSS encryption ensures that all data stored and transmitted through DataWorks development
  endpoints maintains confidentiality and integrity.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS development has endpoints oss encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
