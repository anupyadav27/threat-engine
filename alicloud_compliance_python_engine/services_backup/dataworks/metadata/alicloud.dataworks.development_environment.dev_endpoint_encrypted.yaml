description: This rule verifies that DataWorks development environment endpoints have
  encryption enabled to protect data in transit. Unencrypted endpoints expose sensitive
  data processing workflows and development code to potential interception and unauthorized
  access. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements for data protection
  standards and prevents data breaches during development activities.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS development_environment has dev endpoint encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
