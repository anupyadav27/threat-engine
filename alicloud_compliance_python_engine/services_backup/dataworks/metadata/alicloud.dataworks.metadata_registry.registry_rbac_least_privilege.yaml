description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Metadata Registry follows the principle
  of least privilege in its Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration. Excessive
  permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, data lineage
  information, and potential data breaches. Proper RBAC implementation is essential
  for compliance with data governance frameworks and regulatory requirements.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata_registry has registry rbac least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
