description: This rule verifies that DataWorks workflow definitions are stored with
  encryption enabled to protect sensitive data processing logic and business workflows.
  Unencrypted workflow definitions expose proprietary business processes, data transformation
  logic, and potentially sensitive configuration parameters to unauthorized access.
  Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements for data protection regulations
  and maintains confidentiality of critical business intelligence assets.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS workflow_definition has definition storage encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
