description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for DataWorks registry
  metadata to protect sensitive data schema information and metadata at rest. Unencrypted
  metadata can expose data lineage, table structures, and business logic to unauthorized
  access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Enabling
  encryption helps meet regulatory requirements and protects intellectual property
  stored in DataWorks metadata repositories.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata has registry metadata encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
