description: Ensures that DataWorks metadata registry resources are not shared across
  different AliCloud accounts without proper authorization controls. Unrestricted
  cross-account sharing can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, data
  lineage information, and potential data breaches. This control helps maintain data
  governance compliance and prevents inadvertent exposure of metadata to external
  accounts.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata has registry cross account sharing restricted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
