description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Machine Learning transform operations
  have encryption enabled for data stored at rest. Unencrypted data at rest poses
  significant security risks including unauthorized access to sensitive machine learning
  datasets and potential compliance violations with data protection regulations. Enabling
  encryption at rest ensures that stored transform data remains protected even if
  underlying storage systems are compromised.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS ml has transform encrypted at rest properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
