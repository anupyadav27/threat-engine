description: This rule ensures that audit logging for data catalog changes is enabled
  in DataWorks to maintain comprehensive security monitoring. Without proper audit
  logging, unauthorized modifications to data catalogs cannot be tracked, creating
  compliance violations and security blind spots. Enabling catalog change audit logging
  is essential for data governance, regulatory compliance, and forensic analysis of
  data access patterns.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_data has catalog change audit logging enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
