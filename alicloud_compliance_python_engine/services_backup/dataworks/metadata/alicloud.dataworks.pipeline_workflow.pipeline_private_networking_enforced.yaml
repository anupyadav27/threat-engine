description: This rule verifies that DataWorks pipeline workflows are configured to
  use private network connectivity instead of public internet access. Public network
  exposure increases the risk of data interception, unauthorized access, and potential
  compliance violations with data protection regulations. Enforcing private networking
  helps maintain data confidentiality and reduces the attack surface for sensitive
  data processing workflows.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS pipeline_workflow has pipeline private networking enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
