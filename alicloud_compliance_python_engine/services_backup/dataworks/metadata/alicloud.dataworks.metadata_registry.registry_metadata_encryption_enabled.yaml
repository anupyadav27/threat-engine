description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for DataWorks metadata
  registry to protect sensitive data lineage, schema information, and metadata at
  rest. Unencrypted metadata registries expose critical business intelligence and
  data structure information to unauthorized access, potentially violating data protection
  regulations and compromising data governance frameworks.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata_registry has registry metadata encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
