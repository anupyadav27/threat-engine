description: This rule verifies that DataWorks development environment endpoints have
  encryption enabled for CloudMonitor logs to protect sensitive operational data in
  transit and at rest. Unencrypted logs can expose workflow execution details, data
  lineage information, and system metrics to unauthorized access. Enabling encryption
  helps meet compliance requirements and protects against data breaches in monitoring
  and logging infrastructure.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS development has endpoints cloudmonitor logs encryption
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
