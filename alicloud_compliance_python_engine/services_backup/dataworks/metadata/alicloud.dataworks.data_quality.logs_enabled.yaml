description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for DataWorks Data Quality
  monitoring to capture data validation events, rule execution results, and quality
  assessment activities. Without proper logging, organizations cannot track data quality
  issues, investigate compliance violations, or maintain audit trails required for
  regulatory frameworks. Enabling comprehensive logging is essential for data governance,
  troubleshooting quality failures, and demonstrating compliance with data protection
  regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_quality has logs enabled properly configured for
