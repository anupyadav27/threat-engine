description: Ensures that DataWorks development environment endpoint roles are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions following the principle of least privilege. Overly
  permissive roles can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation attacks,
  and compliance violations with data governance standards. This control helps maintain
  secure access boundaries within DataWorks development workflows.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS development_environment has dev endpoint role least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
