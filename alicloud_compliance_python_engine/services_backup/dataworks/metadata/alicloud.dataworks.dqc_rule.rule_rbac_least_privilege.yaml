description: Ensures DataWorks Data Quality Center (DQC) rules implement role-based
  access control with least privilege principles to prevent unauthorized access to
  data quality monitoring configurations. Excessive permissions on DQC rules can lead
  to unauthorized data quality rule modifications, potential data governance bypass,
  and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_rule has rule rbac least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
