description: This rule verifies that DataWorks connections are configured to use private
  networking instead of public internet connectivity. Using private networking reduces
  exposure to external threats and prevents sensitive data from traversing public
  networks, which is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance
  requirements for data processing workflows.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS connections has connection private networking enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
