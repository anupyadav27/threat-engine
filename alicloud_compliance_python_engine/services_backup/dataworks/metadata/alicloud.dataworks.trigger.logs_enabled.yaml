  audit trails of workflow executions and data processing activities. Without proper
  logging, organizations cannot effectively monitor data pipeline operations, detect
  security incidents, or meet compliance requirements for data governance and regulatory
  auditing.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS trigger has logs enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
