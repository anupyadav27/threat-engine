  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of data operations and access patterns. Without
  proper logging enabled, organizations cannot track data lineage, detect unauthorized
  access, or meet compliance requirements for data governance and security monitoring.
  Enabling object logging is essential for forensic analysis and regulatory compliance
  in data processing environments.
