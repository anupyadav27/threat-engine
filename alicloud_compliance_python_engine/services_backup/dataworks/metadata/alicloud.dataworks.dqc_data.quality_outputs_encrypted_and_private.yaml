description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Data Quality Center (DQC) data outputs
  are properly encrypted and configured with private access controls. Unencrypted
  or publicly accessible quality outputs can expose sensitive data profiling results
  and quality metrics, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  Proper encryption and private access configuration ensures data quality outputs
  remain confidential and meet regulatory requirements.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_data has quality outputs encrypted and private properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
