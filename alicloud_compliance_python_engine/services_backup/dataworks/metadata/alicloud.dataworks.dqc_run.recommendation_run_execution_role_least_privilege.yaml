description: This rule verifies that execution roles assigned to DataWorks Data Quality
  Center recommendation runs are configured with minimal necessary permissions. Overprivileged
  execution roles can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation attacks,
  and compliance violations with data governance frameworks. Implementing least privilege
  access controls reduces the attack surface and ensures recommendation runs operate
  within appropriate security boundaries.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_run has recommendation run execution role least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
