description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Data Quality Center recommendation
  outputs are properly encrypted and set to private access to protect sensitive data
  quality insights. Unencrypted or publicly accessible recommendation outputs can
  expose business-critical data patterns and quality metrics, potentially leading
  to data breaches and compliance violations. Proper encryption and private configuration
  ensure that data quality recommendations remain confidential and meet regulatory
  requirements for data protection.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_recommendation has recommendation outputs encrypted
  and private properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
