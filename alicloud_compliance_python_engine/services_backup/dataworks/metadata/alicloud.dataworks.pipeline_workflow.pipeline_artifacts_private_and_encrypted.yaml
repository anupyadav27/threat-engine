description: This rule verifies that DataWorks pipeline workflow artifacts are configured
  with private access controls and encryption at rest. Unencrypted or publicly accessible
  pipeline artifacts can expose sensitive data processing logic, credentials, and
  business intelligence to unauthorized access. Proper encryption and access controls
  are essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements
  for data processing workflows.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS pipeline_workflow has pipeline artifacts private and
  encrypted properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
