description: Ensures that DataWorks data source connections enforce TLS encryption
  to protect data in transit. Unencrypted connections expose sensitive data to interception
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially violating data protection regulations
  and compromising data integrity. This control is essential for maintaining secure
  data pipelines and meeting compliance requirements for data processing workflows.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS connection has tls required properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
