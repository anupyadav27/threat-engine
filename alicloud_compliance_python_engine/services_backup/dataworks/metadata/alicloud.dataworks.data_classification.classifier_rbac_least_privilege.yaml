description: Validates that DataWorks data classification classifiers are configured
  with role-based access control (RBAC) following the least privilege principle. Excessive
  permissions on data classifiers can lead to unauthorized data access, potential
  data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper
  RBAC implementation ensures users only have the minimum permissions necessary to
  perform their job functions.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_classification has classifier rbac least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
