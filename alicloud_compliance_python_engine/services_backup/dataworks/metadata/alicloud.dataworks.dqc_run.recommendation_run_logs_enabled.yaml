description: This rule verifies that recommendation run logs are enabled for DataWorks
  Data Quality Center operations. Without proper logging enabled, organizations lose
  visibility into data quality recommendation processes, making it difficult to track
  data governance activities and comply with audit requirements. Missing recommendation
  run logs can hinder incident response and forensic analysis when data quality issues
  occur.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_run has recommendation run logs enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
