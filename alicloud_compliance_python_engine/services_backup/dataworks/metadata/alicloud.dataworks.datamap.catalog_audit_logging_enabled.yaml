description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for DataWorks DataMap
  catalog operations to track data discovery, classification, and lineage activities.
  Without proper audit logging, organizations cannot monitor unauthorized data access,
  detect potential data breaches, or maintain compliance with data governance regulations.
  Enabling catalog audit logging is essential for maintaining data security visibility
  and meeting regulatory requirements for data protection.
