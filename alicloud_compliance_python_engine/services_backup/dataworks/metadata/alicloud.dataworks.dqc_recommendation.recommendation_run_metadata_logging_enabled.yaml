description: This rule verifies that metadata logging is enabled for Data Quality
  Center recommendation runs in DataWorks. Without proper logging, organizations lose
  visibility into data quality assessment activities, making it difficult to track
  compliance with data governance policies and investigate potential data quality
  issues. Enabling metadata logging is essential for maintaining audit trails and
  meeting regulatory compliance requirements for data processing activities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc_recommendation has recommendation run metadata logging
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
