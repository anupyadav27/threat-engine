description: This rule verifies that DataWorks jobs are configured to use private
  network connectivity exclusively, preventing exposure to public internet. Jobs with
  public network access increase the attack surface and risk of data exfiltration,
  potentially violating data protection compliance requirements. Private-only network
  configuration ensures secure data processing within isolated network environments.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS tasks_jobs has job network private only properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
