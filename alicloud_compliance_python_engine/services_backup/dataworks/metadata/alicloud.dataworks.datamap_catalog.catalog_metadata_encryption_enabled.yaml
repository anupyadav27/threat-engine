description: This rule verifies that catalog metadata encryption is enabled for DataWorks
  DataMap catalogs to protect sensitive data lineage and metadata information at rest.
  Unencrypted catalog metadata can expose critical business information, data relationships,
  and schema details to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches
  and compliance violations with regulations like GDPR and SOX.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_catalog has catalog metadata encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
