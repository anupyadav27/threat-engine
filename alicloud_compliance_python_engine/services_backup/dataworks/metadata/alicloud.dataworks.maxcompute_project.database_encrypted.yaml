description: This rule verifies that database encryption is enabled for MaxCompute
  projects within DataWorks to protect sensitive data at rest. Unencrypted databases
  expose organizations to data breaches and regulatory compliance violations. Enabling
  encryption helps meet security standards and protects against unauthorized access
  to stored data.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS maxcompute_project has database encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
