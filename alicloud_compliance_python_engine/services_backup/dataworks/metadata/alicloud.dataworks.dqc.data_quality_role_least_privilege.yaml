  configured with minimal necessary permissions to perform their designated functions.

  data processing workflows and compromise data governance compliance. Proper role
  privilege management is essential for maintaining data security and meeting regulatory
  requirements in data analytics environments.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc has data quality role least privilege properly configured
