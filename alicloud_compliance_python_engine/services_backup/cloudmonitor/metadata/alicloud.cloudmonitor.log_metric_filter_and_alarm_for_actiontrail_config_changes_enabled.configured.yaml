description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has configured log metric filters
  and alarms to detect ActionTrail configuration changes. Without proper monitoring
  of ActionTrail modifications, unauthorized changes to audit logging could go undetected,
  potentially allowing malicious activities to occur without proper audit trails.
  This monitoring is essential for maintaining compliance with security frameworks
  and ensuring continuous audit visibility.

rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_metric_filter_and_alarm_for_actiontrail_config_changes_enabled
