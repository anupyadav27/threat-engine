  and alarms configured to detect configuration changes across cloud resources. Without
  proper monitoring of configuration changes, unauthorized modifications to critical
  infrastructure components may go undetected, potentially leading to security breaches,
  compliance violations, and operational disruptions. Implementing comprehensive configuration
  change monitoring is essential for maintaining security posture and meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements.
