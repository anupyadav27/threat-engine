description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Log Service has proper metric filters
  and alarms configured to detect changes to ActionTrail configurations with a minimum
  90-day log retention period. Without proper monitoring and alerting on ActionTrail
  modifications, unauthorized changes to audit logging could go undetected, potentially
  allowing malicious activities to evade detection and compromising compliance with
  security frameworks that require comprehensive audit trail monitoring.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log has metric filter and alarm for actiontrail changes
  with 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
