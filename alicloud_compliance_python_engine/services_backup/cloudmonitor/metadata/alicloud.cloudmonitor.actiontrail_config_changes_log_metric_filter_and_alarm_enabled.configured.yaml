description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has proper log metric filters and
  alarms configured to detect ActionTrail configuration changes. Without these monitoring
  controls, unauthorized modifications to audit logging configurations could go undetected,
  potentially allowing attackers to disable logging before performing malicious activities.
  This monitoring is essential for maintaining audit trail integrity and meeting compliance
  requirements for security event detection.
