description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has a log metric filter configured
  to detect user sign-in events without multi-factor authentication (MFA). Without
  proper monitoring of non-MFA logins, organizations cannot detect potential unauthorized
  access attempts or enforce MFA compliance policies. This monitoring is essential
  for maintaining security audit trails and meeting compliance requirements for access
  control.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_metric_filter_for_sign_in_without_mfa has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
