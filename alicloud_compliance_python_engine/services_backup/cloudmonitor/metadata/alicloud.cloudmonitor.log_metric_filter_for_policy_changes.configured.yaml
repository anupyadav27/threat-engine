description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has log metric filters configured
  to detect policy changes across AliCloud services. Without proper monitoring of
  policy modifications, unauthorized changes to access controls, security policies,
  and resource permissions may go undetected, potentially leading to privilege escalation,
  data breaches, and compliance violations. Implementing log metric filters for policy
  changes enables real-time alerting and audit trail maintenance for critical security
  events.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_metric_filter_for_policy_changes has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
