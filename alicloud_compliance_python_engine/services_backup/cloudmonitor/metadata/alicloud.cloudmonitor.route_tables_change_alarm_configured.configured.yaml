description: Route table modifications can significantly impact network traffic flow
  and security posture by potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access or
  creating network segmentation bypasses. Configuring CloudMonitor alarms for route
  table changes enables real-time detection of unauthorized network modifications
  and supports compliance requirements for network monitoring. This control helps
  maintain network security integrity and provides audit trails for routing changes.
