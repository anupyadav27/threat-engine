description: CloudMonitor log groups with insufficient retention periods may not meet
  compliance requirements and can hinder security incident investigation and forensic
  analysis. Short retention periods increase the risk of losing critical audit trails
  and security events before they can be properly analyzed. Organizations should maintain
  logs for at least 90 days to support security monitoring, compliance audits, and
  incident response activities.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_group has retention 90 days properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
