description: Ensures that deletion events for CloudMonitor alert policy assignments
  are properly logged and auditable. Without proper logging of policy assignment deletions,
  organizations lose visibility into critical monitoring configuration changes that
  could impact incident response capabilities. This logging is essential for maintaining
  security compliance, forensic analysis, and detecting unauthorized modifications
  to alerting policies.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR alert has policy assignment deletion logged properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
