description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor log groups are configured with KMS
  Customer Master Key (CMK) encryption for data at rest. Without proper encryption,
  log data containing sensitive information could be exposed to unauthorized access,
  potentially violating data protection regulations and compromising security monitoring
  capabilities. Enabling KMS CMK encryption ensures stronger key management control
  and compliance with security standards.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_group_kms_cmk_encryption_at_rest_enabled has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
