description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has a log metric filter configured
  to detect changes to OSS bucket policies. Without proper monitoring of bucket policy
  modifications, unauthorized access changes could go undetected, potentially leading
  to data breaches or compliance violations. Implementing this metric filter enables
  real-time alerting on critical bucket security configuration changes.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_metric_filter_for_bucket_policy_changes has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
