description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor alarms are properly configured to
  detect changes in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. VPC modifications
  without proper monitoring can lead to unauthorized network access, security group
  bypasses, and compliance violations. Implementing VPC change alarms enables rapid
  detection of potentially malicious network topology modifications and supports incident
  response requirements.
