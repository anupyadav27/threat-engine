description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has a log metric filter configured
  to detect KMS customer master key (CMK) deletion or disablement events. Without
  proper monitoring of CMK lifecycle events, organizations may miss critical security
  incidents that could lead to data access loss or compliance violations. Monitoring
  CMK deletion and disablement is essential for maintaining data encryption integrity
  and meeting regulatory audit requirements.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_metric_filter_for_kms_cmk_deletion_or_disablement
  has configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
