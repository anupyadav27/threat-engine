  to detect unauthorized API calls across AliCloud services. Without proper monitoring
  of unauthorized API access attempts, organizations cannot detect potential security
  breaches, privilege escalation attacks, or compliance violations in real-time. Implementing
  this metric filter is essential for maintaining audit trails and meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements.
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
