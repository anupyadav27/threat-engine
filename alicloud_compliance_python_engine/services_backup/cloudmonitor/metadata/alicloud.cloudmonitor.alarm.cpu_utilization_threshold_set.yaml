description: Ensures that AliCloud CloudMonitor alarms have properly configured CPU
  utilization thresholds to detect performance anomalies and potential security incidents.
  Missing or misconfigured CPU utilization thresholds can lead to undetected resource
  exhaustion attacks, cryptomining activities, or system compromises that manifest
  as abnormal CPU usage patterns. Proper threshold configuration is essential for
  maintaining system availability and meeting compliance requirements for infrastructure
  monitoring.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR alarm has cpu utilization threshold set properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
