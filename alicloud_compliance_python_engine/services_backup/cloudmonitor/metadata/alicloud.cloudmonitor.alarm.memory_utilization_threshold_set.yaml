description: Ensures that CloudMonitor alarms are configured with appropriate memory
  utilization thresholds to detect resource exhaustion and potential security incidents.
  Proper memory monitoring prevents service degradation, helps identify resource-based
  attacks, and maintains compliance with operational security requirements. Missing
  memory utilization alerts can lead to undetected performance issues and security
  vulnerabilities.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR alarm has memory utilization threshold set properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
