description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor log groups are configured with KMS
  encryption at rest to protect sensitive log data from unauthorized access. Without
  proper encryption, log data stored in CloudMonitor may be vulnerable to data breaches
  and fail to meet compliance requirements for data protection standards such as PCI
  DSS and GDPR. Enabling KMS encryption ensures that log data is cryptographically
  protected using customer-managed or service-managed encryption keys.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_group has kms encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
