description: Auto Scaling groups without proper health check configuration may fail
  to detect and replace unhealthy instances, leading to service degradation and potential
  security vulnerabilities from compromised instances remaining active. This misconfiguration
  can result in compliance violations and reduced system resilience against failures
  and attacks.
domain: compliance_and_governance
rationale: Ensures ESS group has health check configured properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
