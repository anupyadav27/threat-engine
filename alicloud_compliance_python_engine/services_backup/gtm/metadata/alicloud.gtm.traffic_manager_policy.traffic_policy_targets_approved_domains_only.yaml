description: This rule verifies that Global Traffic Manager traffic policies route
  traffic exclusively to pre-approved domains, preventing unauthorized domain targeting
  that could lead to traffic hijacking or data exfiltration. Non-compliance increases
  risks of DNS-based attacks and may violate organizational security policies requiring
  controlled traffic routing destinations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GTM traffic_manager_policy has traffic policy targets approved
  domains only properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
