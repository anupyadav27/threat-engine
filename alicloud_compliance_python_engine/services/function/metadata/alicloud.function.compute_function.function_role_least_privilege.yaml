resource: compute_function
requirement: Function Role Least Privilege

domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Alibaba Cloud Function Compute functions should use roles with least privilege
  permissions
rationale: Ensures FUNCTION compute_function has function role least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute functions should be assigned IAM roles with minimal
  necessary permissions to reduce the attack surface and prevent privilege escalation.
  Overly permissive roles can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and
  data breaches if the function is compromised. This practice is essential for maintaining
  security compliance and following the principle of least privilege.
