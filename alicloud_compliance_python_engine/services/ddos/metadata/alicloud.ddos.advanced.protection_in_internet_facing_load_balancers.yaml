title: Ensure Anti-DDoS Pro/Premium Protection is Enabled for Internet-Facing Load
  Balancers
rationale: Ensures DDOS advanced has protection in internet facing load balancers
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Internet-facing load balancers are prime targets for DDoS attacks that
  can cause service disruption and financial losses. This rule verifies that Anti-DDoS
  Pro or Premium protection is properly configured for load balancers exposed to the
  internet. Failure to implement advanced DDoS protection can result in service unavailability
  and non-compliance with security frameworks requiring robust network protection
  measures.
