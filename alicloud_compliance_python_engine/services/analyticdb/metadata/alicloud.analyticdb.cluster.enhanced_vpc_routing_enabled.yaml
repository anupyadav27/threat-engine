title: AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL cluster should have Enhanced VPC Routing enabled
rationale: Ensures ANALYTICDB cluster has enhanced vpc routing enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL clusters have Enhanced
  VPC Routing enabled to provide better network isolation and security control. Without
  Enhanced VPC Routing, cluster traffic may bypass VPC security controls, potentially
  exposing data to unauthorized access and reducing compliance with network segmentation
  requirements. Enabling this feature ensures all cluster traffic flows through the
  VPC, allowing proper application of security groups and network ACLs.
