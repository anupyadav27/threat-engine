title: AliCloud Data Lake Formation Catalog Metadata Encryption Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATA lake_formation_catalog has catalog metadata encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Lake Formation catalog metadata is encrypted at rest
  to protect sensitive data schema and structure information. Unencrypted catalog
  metadata exposes database schemas, table structures, and data lineage information
  to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  This control is essential for meeting data protection regulations and maintaining
  confidentiality of data lake assets.
