service: emr
resource: encrypted
requirement: With Cmks Disabled
scope: emr.encrypted.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Elastic MapReduce (EMR) clusters should not have Customer Master Key (CMK)
  encryption disabled
rationale: Ensures EMR encrypted has with cmks disabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that EMR clusters have CMK-based encryption enabled
  to protect sensitive data at rest. Disabling CMK encryption exposes cluster data
  to unauthorized access and fails to meet enterprise security standards and compliance
  requirements. Proper encryption with customer-managed keys provides enhanced security
  control and audit capabilities for big data processing workloads.
