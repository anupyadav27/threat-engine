title: Auto Scaling Groups Should Be Deployed Across Multiple Availability Zones
rationale: Ensures ESS group has multi az deployment properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Auto Scaling groups deployed in a single availability zone create critical
  points of failure that can result in complete service outages during zone-level
  incidents. Multi-AZ deployment ensures high availability and fault tolerance by
  distributing instances across geographically separated zones, reducing the risk
  of service disruption and maintaining compliance with business continuity requirements.
