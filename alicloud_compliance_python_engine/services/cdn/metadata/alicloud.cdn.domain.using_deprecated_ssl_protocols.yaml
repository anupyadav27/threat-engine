title: AliCloud Content Delivery Network Domain Should Not Use Deprecated SSL Protocols
rationale: Ensures CDN domain has using deprecated ssl protocols properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies CDN domains configured with deprecated SSL protocols
  (TLS 1.0/1.1 or SSL 2.0/3.0) that pose significant security vulnerabilities. Using
  outdated SSL/TLS protocols exposes data transmission to man-in-the-middle attacks,
  protocol downgrade attacks, and fails to meet modern compliance standards including
  PCI DSS and industry security frameworks. CDN domains should enforce TLS 1.2 or
  higher to ensure secure content delivery and protect end-user communications.
