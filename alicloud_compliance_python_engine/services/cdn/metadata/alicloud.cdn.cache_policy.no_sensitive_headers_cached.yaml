title: AliCloud Content Delivery Network Cache Policy Should Not Cache Sensitive Headers
rationale: Ensures CDN cache_policy has no sensitive headers cached properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that CDN cache policies are configured to exclude sensitive
  headers from being cached at edge locations. Caching sensitive headers like Authorization,
  Set-Cookie, or custom authentication tokens can lead to unauthorized access to user
  credentials and session data. Proper header caching configuration is essential for
  maintaining data privacy and meeting compliance requirements for web applications.
