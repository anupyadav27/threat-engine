title: Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network Domain Should Have HTTPS Enabled
rationale: Ensures CDN domain has https enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud CDN domains have HTTPS encryption enabled
  to protect data in transit between clients and edge nodes. Without HTTPS, sensitive
  data transmitted through the CDN is vulnerable to interception, man-in-the-middle
  attacks, and eavesdropping. This configuration is essential for compliance with
  data protection regulations and maintaining user trust.
