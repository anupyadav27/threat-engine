title: Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network Domain Logging Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures CDN domain has logging enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: CDN domain logging must be enabled to maintain comprehensive audit trails
  and security monitoring capabilities. Without proper logging, organizations cannot
  detect malicious activities, investigate security incidents, or meet compliance
  requirements for data access monitoring. This creates significant blind spots in
  security posture and regulatory compliance.
