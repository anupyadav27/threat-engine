title: AliCloud Dynamic Content Delivery Network (DCDN) Should Require Signed URLs
  or Headers for Private Content Access
rationale: Ensures CDN dcdn has cdn signed urls or headers required for private content
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that DCDN domains serving private content implement
  URL signing or header authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
  Without proper authentication controls, sensitive content may be exposed to unauthorized
  users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Implementing signed URLs
  or authentication headers provides granular access control and audit trails for
  private content distribution.
