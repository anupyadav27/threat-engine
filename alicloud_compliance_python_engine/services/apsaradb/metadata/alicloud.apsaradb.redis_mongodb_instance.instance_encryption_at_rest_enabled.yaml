title: ApsaraDB for Redis and MongoDB Instances Should Have Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures APSARADB redis_mongodb_instance has instance encryption at rest
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis and MongoDB instances have
  encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data stored in databases. Without
  encryption at rest, data stored on disk is vulnerable to unauthorized access in
  case of physical security breaches or insider threats. Enabling encryption at rest
  helps meet compliance requirements for data protection standards such as PCI DSS,
  GDPR, and SOC 2.
