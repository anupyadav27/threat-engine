title: ApsaraDB for MongoDB Cluster Audit Logging Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures APSARADB mongodb_cluster has cluster audit logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that audit logging is enabled for ApsaraDB for MongoDB clusters
  to track database operations and access patterns. Without audit logging, organizations
  cannot monitor unauthorized access attempts, data modifications, or comply with
  regulatory requirements that mandate database activity tracking. This creates significant
  security blind spots and compliance violations in database governance.
