title: ApsaraDB RDS instances must have SSL/TLS encryption enabled for data in transit
rationale: Ensures APSARADB instance has in transit required properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ApsaraDB RDS instances have SSL/TLS encryption
  enabled to protect data transmitted between clients and the database server. Without
  encryption in transit, sensitive data can be intercepted and compromised during
  transmission, violating data protection regulations and security compliance requirements.
  Enabling SSL/TLS encryption is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and
  meeting industry security standards.
