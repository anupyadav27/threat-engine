title: ApsaraDB RDS Instance Encryption at Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures APSARADB rds_instance has instance encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ApsaraDB RDS instances have encryption at rest enabled to
  protect sensitive data stored in databases. Without encryption at rest, database
  files, backups, and snapshots remain vulnerable to unauthorized access if storage
  media is compromised. This control is essential for meeting compliance requirements
  such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and other data protection regulations.
