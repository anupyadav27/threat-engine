title: Alibaba Cloud API Keys Should Have Access Restrictions Configured
rationale: Ensures APIKEYS api has restrictions configured properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: API keys without proper access restrictions pose significant security
  risks by allowing unrestricted access to cloud resources and services. Unrestricted
  API keys can lead to unauthorized data access, resource manipulation, and potential
  compliance violations. Implementing IP restrictions, time-based access controls,
  and service-specific limitations helps minimize the attack surface and ensures principle
  of least privilege.
