title: AliCloud Configuration Audit Delivery Channel KMS Encryption Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures CONFIG delivery_channel has kms encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Configuration Audit delivery channels have KMS encryption
  enabled to protect configuration data in transit and at rest. Without KMS encryption,
  sensitive configuration information and compliance audit trails may be exposed to
  unauthorized access, potentially violating data protection regulations and compromising
  security posture visibility.
