title: AliCloud Config Remediation Auto Remediation Should Be Enabled For High Severity
  Rules
rationale: Ensures CONFIG remediation has config remediation auto remediation enabled
  for high properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Config remediation has auto-remediation enabled
  for high-severity compliance rules to automatically fix critical security misconfigurations.
  Without auto-remediation for high-severity issues, critical security violations
  may persist unaddressed, increasing the risk of data breaches and regulatory compliance
  failures. This control helps maintain continuous compliance by automatically resolving
  high-priority security issues as soon as they are detected.
