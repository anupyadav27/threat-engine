title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Log Groups Do Not Contain Secrets and Have Proper
  Access Control
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_group has no secrets in logs with access control
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor log groups do not contain sensitive
  information such as passwords, API keys, or tokens, and have appropriate access
  control policies configured. Storing secrets in logs can lead to credential exposure
  and unauthorized access, potentially violating compliance requirements like PCI
  DSS and SOC 2. Proper access control prevents unauthorized users from accessing
  sensitive log data.
