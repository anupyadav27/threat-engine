title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor log metric filter for authentication failures
  is configured
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_metric_filter_for_authentication_failures has
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has proper log metric filters configured
  to detect and alert on authentication failures across AliCloud services. Without
  proper monitoring of authentication events, organizations cannot effectively detect
  brute force attacks, credential stuffing attempts, or unauthorized access patterns.
  This monitoring capability is essential for maintaining security compliance frameworks
  and enabling rapid incident response to potential security breaches.
