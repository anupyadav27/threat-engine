title: Ensure AliCloud CloudMonitor Log Groups Are Not Publicly Accessible and Have
  Encryption Enabled
rationale: Ensures CLOUDMONITOR log_group has not publicly accessible with encryption
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor log groups are configured with proper
  access controls to prevent public exposure and have encryption enabled to protect
  sensitive log data. Publicly accessible log groups can lead to unauthorized data
  exposure and compliance violations, while unencrypted logs may expose sensitive
  information in transit and at rest. Proper configuration ensures log data confidentiality
  and meets security compliance requirements.
