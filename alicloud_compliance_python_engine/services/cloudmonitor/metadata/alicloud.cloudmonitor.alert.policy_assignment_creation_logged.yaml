description: Ensures that all policy assignment creation events in CloudMonitor are
  properly logged and auditable. Without proper logging of policy assignment changes,
  organizations cannot track who created or modified alert policies, creating security
  blind spots and compliance violations. This monitoring is essential for maintaining
  accountability and detecting unauthorized changes to critical monitoring configurations.
