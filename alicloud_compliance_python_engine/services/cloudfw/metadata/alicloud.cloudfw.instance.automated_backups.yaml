title: AliCloud Cloud Firewall instances should have automated backups enabled
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW instance has automated backups properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Cloud Firewall instances without automated backups pose significant security
  risks including potential data loss of firewall configurations, security policies,
  and access rules during system failures or security incidents. This configuration
  gap can lead to extended downtime and compliance violations when disaster recovery
  procedures cannot be executed effectively.
