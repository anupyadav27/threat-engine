title: Ensure AliCloud Cloud Firewall logging is enabled
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW logging has enabled properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: AliCloud Cloud Firewall logging must be enabled to capture network traffic

  activities, perform forensic analysis, or meet regulatory compliance standards that
  require comprehensive network security audit trails.
