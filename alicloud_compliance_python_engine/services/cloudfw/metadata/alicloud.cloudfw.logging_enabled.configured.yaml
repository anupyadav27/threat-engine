  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled and properly configured for
  AliCloud Cloud Firewall to capture network traffic and security events. Without

  attack patterns, and cannot meet compliance requirements for audit trails. Inadequate
  firewall logging significantly hampers incident response capabilities and forensic
  analysis.
