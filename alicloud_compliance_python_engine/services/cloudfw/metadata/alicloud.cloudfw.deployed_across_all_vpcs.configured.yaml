title: Ensure AliCloud Cloud Firewall is deployed across all VPCs for comprehensive
  network protection
rationale: Ensures CLOUDFW deployed_across_all_vpcs has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: AliCloud Cloud Firewall should be configured to protect all Virtual Private
  Clouds (VPCs) in your environment to ensure comprehensive network security coverage.
  Without complete VPC coverage, unprotected network segments may become attack vectors,
  potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This configuration
  is essential for maintaining consistent security policies and monitoring across
  your entire cloud infrastructure.
