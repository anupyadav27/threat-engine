  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) attached to Cloud Enterprise
  Network instances have restrictive security group rules configured. Overly permissive

  security breaches. This control helps maintain network segmentation and reduces
  attack surface area in compliance with security frameworks.
