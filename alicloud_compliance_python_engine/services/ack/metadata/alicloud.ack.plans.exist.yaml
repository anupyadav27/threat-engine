title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters must have maintenance plans
  configured
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes plans has exist properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: ACK clusters without maintenance plans lack automated security patching
  and system updates, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
  This increases security risks and may violate compliance requirements for maintaining
  up-to-date container infrastructure. Proper maintenance planning ensures timely
  application of critical security patches and reduces the attack surface.
