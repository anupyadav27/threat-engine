title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Control Plane Root CA File Must
  Be Configured
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has root ca file
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the Kubernetes API server control plane has a properly configured
  root Certificate Authority (CA) file for secure TLS communication. Without a valid
  root CA file, the cluster cannot establish trusted connections between components,
  leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks and compromised cluster security.
  This configuration is essential for maintaining PKI trust chains and meeting security
  compliance requirements.
