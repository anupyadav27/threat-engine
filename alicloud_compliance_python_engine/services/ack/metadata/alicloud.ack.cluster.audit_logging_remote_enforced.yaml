title: Container Service for Kubernetes cluster must have audit logging with remote
  enforcement enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has audit logging remote
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters
  have audit logging configured with remote enforcement to capture and securely transmit
  security events to external systems. Without proper audit logging enforcement, security
  incidents and compliance violations may go undetected, compromising cluster security
  posture and regulatory compliance requirements. Remote enforcement ensures audit
  logs are reliably collected and protected from local tampering or deletion.
