title: Container Service for Kubernetes etcd Certificate Authentication Should Be
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes etcd has cert auth enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that etcd certificate authentication is enabled in
  Container Service for Kubernetes clusters. Without proper certificate authentication,
  etcd communication channels are vulnerable to unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle
  attacks, potentially compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster's security and violating
  compliance requirements for secure container orchestration.
