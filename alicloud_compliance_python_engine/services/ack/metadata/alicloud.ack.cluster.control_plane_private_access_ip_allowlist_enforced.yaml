title: Container Service for Kubernetes Control Plane Private Access IP Allowlist
  Must Be Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has control plane private
  access ip allowlist enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters have IP
  allowlist restrictions configured for control plane private access endpoints. Without
  proper IP allowlist enforcement, unauthorized networks may gain access to the Kubernetes
  API server, potentially leading to cluster compromise and violation of network segmentation
  compliance requirements. This control is essential for maintaining zero-trust network
  security posture.
