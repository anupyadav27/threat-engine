rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes vaults has encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ACK backup vaults are configured with encryption to protect
  stored backup data at rest. Unencrypted backup vaults expose sensitive container
  workload data and application configurations to unauthorized access, potentially
  leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This control is essential for
  meeting data protection regulations and maintaining the confidentiality of containerized
  applications.
