title: Container Service for Kubernetes Serverless Fargate Profile Execution Role
  Should Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes serverless has fargate profile
  execution role least privilege properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
description: Ensures that Fargate profile execution roles in Container Service for
  Kubernetes (ACK) Serverless clusters are configured with minimal necessary permissions.
  Overprivileged execution roles can lead to unauthorized access to cluster resources
  and potential data breaches. This control helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks by enforcing the principle of least privilege for container workload
  execution.
