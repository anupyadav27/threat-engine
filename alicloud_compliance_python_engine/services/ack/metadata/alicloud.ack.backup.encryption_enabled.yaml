rule_id: alicloud.ack.backup.encryption_enabled
service: ack
resource: backup
requirement: Encryption Enabled
scope: ack.backup.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) backup encryption should be enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes backup has encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that backup encryption is enabled for Container Service
  for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters to protect sensitive data at rest. Unencrypted backups
  expose containerized applications, configurations, and persistent data to unauthorized
  access if storage is compromised. Enabling backup encryption helps meet compliance
  requirements and maintains data confidentiality throughout the backup lifecycle.
