title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Cluster Should Have Network
  Policy Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has network policy enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters
  have network policies enabled to control pod-to-pod communication. Without network
  policy enforcement, pods can communicate freely within the cluster, creating potential
  security risks and lateral movement opportunities for attackers. This control is
  essential for maintaining network segmentation and meeting compliance requirements
  for containerized workloads.
