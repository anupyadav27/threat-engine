rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes vaults has exist properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ACK clusters have associated backup vaults to
  protect against data loss and ensure business continuity. Without proper backup
  vaults, containerized applications and persistent data are vulnerable to accidental
  deletion, corruption, or infrastructure failures. Implementing backup vaults is
  essential for meeting disaster recovery requirements and compliance standards that
  mandate data protection measures.
