title: Container Service for Kubernetes API Server Must Enforce TLS 1.2 Minimum Version
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has apiserver tls
  min 1 2 enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) API server enforces
  TLS 1.2 as the minimum encryption protocol version. Using outdated TLS versions
  (1.0 or 1.1) exposes the cluster to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This configuration is essential for maintaining secure communication between
  clients and the Kubernetes control plane, meeting compliance requirements for data
  protection standards.
