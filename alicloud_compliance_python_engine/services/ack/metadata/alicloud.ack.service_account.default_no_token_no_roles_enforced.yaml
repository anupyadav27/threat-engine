title: Container Service for Kubernetes Default Service Account Token and Role Assignment
  Restrictions
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes service_account has default no
  token no roles enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that default service accounts in Container Service for Kubernetes
  clusters do not have automatic token mounting enabled and are not assigned elevated
  roles or cluster roles. This prevents potential privilege escalation attacks and
  reduces the attack surface by limiting default service account capabilities, which
  is essential for maintaining cluster security and compliance with container security
  standards.
