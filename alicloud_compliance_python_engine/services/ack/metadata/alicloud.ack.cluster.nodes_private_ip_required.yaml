title: Container Service for Kubernetes cluster nodes must use private IP addresses
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes cluster has nodes private ip required
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) cluster nodes are
  configured with private IP addresses only, preventing direct internet exposure.
  Nodes with public IP addresses create security vulnerabilities by exposing the cluster
  infrastructure to external threats and potential unauthorized access. This configuration
  is essential for maintaining network isolation and meeting compliance requirements
  for containerized workloads.
