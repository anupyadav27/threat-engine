title: Container Service for Kubernetes Node Kubelet TLS Minimum Version 1.2 Enforcement
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has kubelet tls min 1 2 enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that kubelet components on Container Service for Kubernetes nodes
  enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher for secure communication. Weak TLS versions expose
  clusters to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception vulnerabilities. This
  control is essential for maintaining compliance with security frameworks and protecting
  sensitive workload communications.
