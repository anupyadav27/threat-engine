title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Namespace Network Policies Present
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes namespace has namespace network
  policies present properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Kubernetes namespaces in ACK clusters have network policies
  configured to control pod-to-pod communication. Without network policies, all pods
  within a namespace can communicate freely, creating potential security risks and
  lateral movement opportunities for attackers. This control is essential for implementing
  network segmentation and maintaining compliance with security frameworks that require
  network-level access controls.
