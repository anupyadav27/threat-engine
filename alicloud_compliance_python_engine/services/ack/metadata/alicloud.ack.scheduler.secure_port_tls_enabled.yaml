title: Container Service for Kubernetes Scheduler Secure Port TLS Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes scheduler has secure port tls
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the Kubernetes scheduler component in Container Service
  for Kubernetes (ACK) has TLS encryption enabled on its secure port. Without TLS
  encryption, scheduler communications are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
  and data interception, potentially compromising cluster security and failing compliance
  requirements for data protection in transit.
