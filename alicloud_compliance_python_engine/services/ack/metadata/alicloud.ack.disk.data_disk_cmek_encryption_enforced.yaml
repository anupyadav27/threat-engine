title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Data Disk CMEK Encryption Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes disk has data disk cmek encryption
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that data disks attached to ACK cluster nodes are encrypted using
  Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed keys. This provides
  enhanced security control over encryption keys and helps meet compliance requirements
  for data protection. Unencrypted or service-managed encrypted disks may expose sensitive
  container data and violate regulatory standards.
