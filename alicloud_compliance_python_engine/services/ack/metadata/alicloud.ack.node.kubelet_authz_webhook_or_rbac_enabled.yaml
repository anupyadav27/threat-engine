title: Container Service for Kubernetes Node Kubelet Authorization Webhook or RBAC
  Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node has kubelet authz webhook
  or rbac enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that kubelet authorization is properly configured on ACK cluster
  nodes through either authorization webhook or RBAC mechanisms. Without proper kubelet
  authorization, unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive node resources and
  container runtime operations, potentially leading to privilege escalation and compliance
  violations. This control is essential for maintaining secure multi-tenant Kubernetes
  environments and meeting security framework requirements.
