title: Container Service for Kubernetes etcd Peer TLS Communication Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes etcd has peer tls enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that etcd peer-to-peer communication is encrypted using TLS in
  Container Service for Kubernetes clusters. Without peer TLS encryption, etcd cluster
  communication is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception,
  potentially exposing sensitive cluster configuration data and compromising the entire
  Kubernetes control plane security.
