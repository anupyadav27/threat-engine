title: Container Service for Kubernetes Pod Security Policy Should Prevent Root User
  Access
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes psp has root user access prevented
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Pod Security Policies in Container Service for Kubernetes
  clusters prevent containers from running as root user (UID 0). Running containers
  as root increases the attack surface and potential for privilege escalation, violating
  security best practices and compliance frameworks that require least privilege access
  controls.
