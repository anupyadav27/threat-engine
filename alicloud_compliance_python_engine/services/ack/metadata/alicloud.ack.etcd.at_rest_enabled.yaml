severity: low
title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) etcd encryption at rest should be enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes etcd has at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that etcd data encryption at rest is enabled for ACK clusters
  to protect sensitive cluster configuration data and secrets. Without encryption
  at rest, etcd data including Kubernetes secrets, ConfigMaps, and cluster state information
  remains vulnerable to unauthorized access if storage media is compromised. This
  control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance
  requirements for containerized workloads.
