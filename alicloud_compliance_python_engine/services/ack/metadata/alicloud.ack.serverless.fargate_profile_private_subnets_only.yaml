title: Container Service for Kubernetes Serverless Fargate profiles should only use
  private subnets
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes serverless has fargate profile
  private subnets only properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Serverless Fargate
  profiles are configured to use only private subnets for enhanced network security.
  Running Fargate workloads in public subnets exposes containers to direct internet
  access, increasing attack surface and potential data exfiltration risks. This configuration
  helps maintain network isolation and supports compliance with security frameworks
  requiring private network deployment.
