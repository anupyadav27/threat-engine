title: Container Service for Kubernetes API Server Should Use RBAC Authorization Mode
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has apiserver authorization
  mode rbac properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) API servers are configured
  with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization mode. Without RBAC, the cluster
  lacks proper access controls, potentially allowing unauthorized users to perform
  privileged operations on cluster resources. This configuration is essential for
  maintaining security boundaries and meeting compliance requirements for container
  orchestration platforms.
