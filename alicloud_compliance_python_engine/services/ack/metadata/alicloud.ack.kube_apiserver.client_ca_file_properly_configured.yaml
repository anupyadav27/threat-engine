title: Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes API Server Client CA File Must
  Be Properly Configured
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes kube_apiserver has client ca file
  properly configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the Kubernetes API server in ACK clusters has a properly
  configured client certificate authority (CA) file for secure client authentication.
  Without proper client CA configuration, the API server cannot validate client certificates,
  leading to potential unauthorized access and compromised cluster security. This
  misconfiguration violates security compliance frameworks and exposes the cluster
  to privilege escalation attacks.
