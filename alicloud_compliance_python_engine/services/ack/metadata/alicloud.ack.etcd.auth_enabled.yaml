title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) etcd Authentication Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes etcd has auth enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that etcd authentication is enabled for ACK clusters to prevent
  unauthorized access to the cluster's configuration data and secrets. Without proper
  authentication, attackers could gain full control over the Kubernetes cluster, compromising
  workloads and sensitive data. This control is essential for maintaining cluster
  security posture and meeting compliance requirements for container orchestration
  platforms.
