title: Container Service for Kubernetes Admission Controller Should Deny Host Namespace
  Usage
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes admission_webhook has admission
  host namespace usage denied properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that admission controllers in Container Service for
  Kubernetes (ACK) clusters are configured to deny pods from using host namespaces
  (hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC). Allowing host namespace usage can lead to container
  escape vulnerabilities and privilege escalation attacks. Proper admission control
  enforcement is essential for maintaining container isolation and meeting security
  compliance requirements.
