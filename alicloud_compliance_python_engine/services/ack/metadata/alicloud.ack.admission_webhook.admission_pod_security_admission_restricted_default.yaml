title: Container Service for Kubernetes admission webhook should enforce Pod Security
  Admission restricted policy as default
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes admission_webhook has admission
  pod security admission restricted default properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters
  have admission webhooks configured to enforce the restricted Pod Security Admission
  policy by default. Without this configuration, pods may be deployed with excessive
  privileges, potentially allowing container escapes, privilege escalation, and unauthorized
  access to cluster resources. This control is essential for maintaining a secure
  multi-tenant environment and meeting compliance requirements for container security
  standards.
