title: Container Service for Kubernetes Control Plane Secure Port Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes control_plane has secure port
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that the Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) control plane
  has secure port enabled for encrypted API server communication. Disabling secure
  port exposes the Kubernetes API server to unencrypted traffic, potentially allowing
  unauthorized access and data interception. This configuration is essential for maintaining
  cluster security and meeting compliance requirements for encrypted communications.
