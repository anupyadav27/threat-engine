title: Container Service for Kubernetes RBAC Least Privilege Secrets Access Enforced
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes rbac has least privilege secrets
  access enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that RBAC policies in Container Service for Kubernetes clusters
  follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to secrets. Overly
  permissive secrets access can lead to credential exposure, privilege escalation,
  and unauthorized access to sensitive application data. This control helps maintain
  compliance with security frameworks that require minimal necessary permissions.
