title: Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) node pool nodes should not have public
  IP addresses
rationale: Ensures Container Service for Kubernetes node_pool has nodes no public
  ip properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ACK cluster node pool nodes do not have public IP addresses
  assigned to reduce attack surface and prevent direct internet exposure. Nodes with
  public IPs increase security risks by allowing direct external access, potentially
  exposing sensitive workloads and violating network isolation compliance requirements.
  Use NAT gateways or load balancers for controlled internet access instead.
