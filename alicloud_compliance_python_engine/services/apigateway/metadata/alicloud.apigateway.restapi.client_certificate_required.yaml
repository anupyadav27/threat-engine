title: AliCloud API Gateway REST API Should Require Client Certificate Authentication
rationale: Ensures APIGATEWAY restapi has client certificate required properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that AliCloud API Gateway REST APIs are configured
  to require client certificate authentication for enhanced security. Without mandatory
  client certificates, APIs are vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. Implementing client certificate requirements helps meet compliance standards
  for secure API communications and provides mutual TLS authentication.
