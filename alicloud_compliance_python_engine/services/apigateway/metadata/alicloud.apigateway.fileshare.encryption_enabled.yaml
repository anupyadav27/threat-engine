title: API Gateway File Share Encryption Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures APIGATEWAY fileshare has encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that file shares used by API Gateway instances have encryption
  enabled to protect sensitive data at rest. Unencrypted file shares expose API configurations,
  logs, and potentially sensitive application data to unauthorized access, violating
  data protection compliance requirements. This control helps maintain confidentiality
  and meets regulatory standards for data encryption.
