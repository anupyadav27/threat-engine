title: Alibaba Cloud Container Registry vulnerability analysis should be enabled
rationale: Ensures ARTIFACTS container has analysis enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that vulnerability analysis is enabled for container images in
  Alibaba Cloud Container Registry. Without vulnerability scanning, container images
  may contain known security vulnerabilities, malware, or outdated packages that could
  compromise application security and violate compliance requirements. This control
  helps identify and remediate security risks before deploying containers to production
  environments.
