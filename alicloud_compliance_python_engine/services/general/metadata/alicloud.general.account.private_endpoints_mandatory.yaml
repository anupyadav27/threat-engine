  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that private endpoints are enforced for accessing
  Alibaba Cloud services within your account to prevent data exposure over public

  access. Enforcing private endpoints helps meet compliance requirements for data
  privacy and network security controls.
