title: Ensure AliCloud Security Center is Enabled for Comprehensive Threat Detection
rationale: Ensures GENERAL resource has security center enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Security Center is enabled to provide
  centralized security monitoring and threat detection across cloud resources. Without
  Security Center enabled, organizations lack visibility into security vulnerabilities,
  malware threats, and compliance violations, potentially exposing critical assets
  to undetected attacks. Enabling Security Center is essential for maintaining security
  compliance frameworks and implementing proactive threat response capabilities.
