title: Ensure AliCloud Access Logging is Enabled with 90-Day Retention Period
rationale: Ensures GENERAL access_logging_enabled_90_day_retention has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that access logging is properly configured with a
  minimum 90-day retention period across AliCloud services. Insufficient log retention
  can hinder security incident investigation, forensic analysis, and compliance with
  regulatory requirements that mandate extended audit trails. Organizations may face
  compliance violations and reduced visibility into historical security events without
  adequate log retention policies.
