title: Virtual Private Cloud Subnet Configuration With NAT Gateway
rationale: Ensures GENERAL vpc has subnet configuration with nat gateway properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Virtual Private Cloud subnets are properly configured with
  NAT Gateway for secure outbound internet access. Misconfigured subnet routing without
  NAT Gateway can expose private resources directly to the internet, creating security
  vulnerabilities and potential compliance violations. Proper NAT Gateway configuration
  maintains network isolation while enabling controlled internet connectivity.
