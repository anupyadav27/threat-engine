subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: AliCloud Data Catalog Metadata Encryption At Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL data_catalog has metadata encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Data Catalog metadata is encrypted at rest to protect
  sensitive data schema information and metadata from unauthorized access. Without
  encryption at rest, metadata containing database schemas, table structures, and
  data lineage information could be exposed if storage media is compromised. This
  control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance
  requirements for data protection regulations.
