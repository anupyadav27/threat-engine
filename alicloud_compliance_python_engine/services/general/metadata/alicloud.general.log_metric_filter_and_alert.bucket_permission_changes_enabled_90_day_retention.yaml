title: Ensure Object Storage Service Bucket Permission Changes Have Log Metric Filter
  and Alert with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has bucket permission changes
  enabled 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Object Storage Service (OSS) bucket permission
  changes are monitored through log metric filters with alerting mechanisms and maintain
  a 90-day log retention period. Inadequate monitoring of bucket permission modifications
  can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations. Proper
  logging and alerting ensure timely detection of security incidents and support forensic
  analysis requirements.
