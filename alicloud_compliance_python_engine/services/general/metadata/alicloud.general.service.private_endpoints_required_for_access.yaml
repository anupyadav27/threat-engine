title: Alibaba Cloud Services Must Use Private Endpoints for Secure Access
rationale: Ensures GENERAL service has private endpoints required for access properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud services are configured to use private endpoints
  instead of public internet access, reducing exposure to external threats and data
  interception risks. Private endpoints provide secure, isolated connectivity within
  your VPC, helping meet compliance requirements for data protection and network security
  standards.
