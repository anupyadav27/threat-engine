title: Alibaba Cloud Firewall Should Restrict Access to Selected Networks Only
rationale: Ensures GENERAL account has firewall restrict to selected networks properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Firewall rules are configured to restrict
  access to specific, authorized networks rather than allowing broad or unrestricted
  access. Overly permissive firewall rules can expose resources to unauthorized access
  and increase the attack surface, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. This control helps maintain network segmentation and follows the principle
  of least privilege access.
