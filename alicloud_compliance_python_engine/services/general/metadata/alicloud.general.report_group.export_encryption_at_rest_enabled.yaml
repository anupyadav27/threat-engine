title: AliCloud CodeBuild Report Group Export Encryption At Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL report_group has export encryption at rest enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud CodeBuild report groups have encryption at rest
  enabled for exported test reports and code coverage data. Without encryption, sensitive
  build artifacts and test results stored in report exports are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and data breaches. This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality
  and meeting compliance requirements for secure software development pipelines.
