title: ApsaraDB for Redis Cluster Should Enforce In-Transit Encryption
rationale: Ensures GENERAL redis_cluster has in transit encryption enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ApsaraDB for Redis clusters have SSL/TLS encryption enabled
  for data transmission between clients and Redis instances. Without in-transit encryption,
  sensitive data transmitted to and from Redis clusters is vulnerable to interception
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially compromising data confidentiality and
  failing compliance requirements for data protection standards.
