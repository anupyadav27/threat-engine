title: Ensure AliCloud General Project Source Repository URLs Use Secure HTTPS Protocol
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has source repo url secure properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule validates that source repository URLs configured in AliCloud
  projects use secure HTTPS protocol instead of insecure HTTP or other unencrypted
  protocols. Insecure repository URLs can expose source code and credentials during
  transmission, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Using
  HTTPS ensures encrypted communication and protects sensitive development assets
  from man-in-the-middle attacks.
