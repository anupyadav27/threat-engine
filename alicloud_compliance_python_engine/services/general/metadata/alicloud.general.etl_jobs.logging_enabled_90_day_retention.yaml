title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks ETL Jobs Have Logging Enabled with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL etl_jobs has logging enabled 90 day retention properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ETL jobs in AliCloud DataWorks have comprehensive
  logging enabled with a minimum 90-day retention period. Insufficient logging retention
  can hinder security incident investigation, compliance auditing, and forensic analysis.
  Organizations may fail to meet regulatory requirements such as SOX, GDPR, or industry-specific
  mandates that require extended log retention for data processing activities.
