title: Alibaba Cloud ActionTrail Log Metric Filter and Alert for Custom Role Changes
  with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has custom role changes enabled
  90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that log metric filters and alerts are configured to monitor
  custom role changes in Alibaba Cloud with a minimum 90-day retention period. Without
  proper monitoring and alerting on role modifications, unauthorized privilege escalations
  and security policy violations may go undetected, potentially leading to data breaches
  and compliance failures. Extended retention periods are essential for forensic analysis
  and meeting regulatory audit requirements.
