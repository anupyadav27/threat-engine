title: Ensure Insecure SSL Ciphers Are Disabled Across AliCloud Services
rationale: Ensures GENERAL insecure_ssl_ciphers_disabled has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that weak and insecure SSL/TLS cipher suites are disabled
  across AliCloud services to prevent cryptographic vulnerabilities. Insecure ciphers
  can expose data in transit to man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise encryption
  integrity. Proper cipher configuration is essential for meeting compliance requirements
  including PCI DSS, SOC 2, and industry security standards.
