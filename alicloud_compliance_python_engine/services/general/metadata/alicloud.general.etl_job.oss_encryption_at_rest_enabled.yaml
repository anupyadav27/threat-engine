subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Object Storage Service Encryption At Rest Is Enabled for ETL Jobs
rationale: Ensures GENERAL etl_job has oss encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets used by
  ETL jobs have encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data. Without encryption
  at rest, data stored in OSS buckets remains vulnerable to unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. Enabling OSS encryption helps meet compliance requirements
  for data protection regulations and industry security standards.
