title: Alibaba Cloud CDN Distribution Logging Must Be Enabled With 90 Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL distribution has logging enabled with 90 day retention
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud CDN distributions have access logging enabled
  with a minimum retention period of 90 days. Without proper logging and retention,
  organizations cannot effectively monitor for security incidents, perform forensic
  analysis, or meet compliance requirements for audit trails. Insufficient log retention
  periods can result in loss of critical security evidence and violation of regulatory
  mandates.
