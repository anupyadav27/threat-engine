subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud General Projects Do Not Store Secrets in Environment Variables
rationale: Ensures GENERAL project has no secrets in environment variables properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule validates that sensitive information such as passwords, API
  keys, and access tokens are not stored in environment variables within AliCloud
  projects. Storing secrets in environment variables creates security vulnerabilities
  as they can be easily exposed through process lists, logs, or configuration dumps,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and compliance violations.
