rule_id: alicloud.general.service.private_link_enforced_for_all_traffic
service: general
resource: service
requirement: Private Link Enforced For All Traffic
scope: general.service.private_networking
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: private_connectivity
severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud PrivateLink is Enforced for All Service Traffic
rationale: Ensures GENERAL service has private link enforced for all traffic properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud PrivateLink is configured to handle
  all service traffic, preventing data from traversing the public internet. Without
  proper PrivateLink enforcement, sensitive data may be exposed to network-based attacks
  and fail to meet compliance requirements for data privacy and network isolation.
  This configuration is essential for maintaining secure communication between VPC
  resources and AliCloud services.
