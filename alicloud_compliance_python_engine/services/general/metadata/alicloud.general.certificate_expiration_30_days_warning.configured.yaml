  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that certificate expiration warnings are configured to alert
  30 days before SSL/TLS certificates expire across AliCloud services. Without proper
  expiration monitoring, expired certificates can cause service outages, break encrypted
  communications, and lead to compliance violations. This proactive alerting mechanism
  is essential for maintaining continuous security posture and preventing certificate-related
  incidents.
