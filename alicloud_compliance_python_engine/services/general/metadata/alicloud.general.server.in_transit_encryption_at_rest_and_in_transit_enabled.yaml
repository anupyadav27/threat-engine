rule_id: alicloud.general.server.in_transit_encryption_at_rest_and_in_transit_enabled
service: general
resource: server
requirement: In Transit Encryption At Rest And In Transit Enabled
scope: general.server.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service instances have both encryption
  at rest and in-transit encryption enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL server has in transit encryption at rest and in transit
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS instances implement comprehensive encryption
  protection through both data-at-rest encryption for storage volumes and in-transit
  encryption for network communications. Without proper encryption implementation,
  sensitive data remains vulnerable to unauthorized access, interception, and potential
  compliance violations with data protection regulations. Enabling both encryption
  types ensures end-to-end data protection across the entire compute infrastructure.
