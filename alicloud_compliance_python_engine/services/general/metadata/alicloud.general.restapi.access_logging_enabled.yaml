title: AliCloud API Gateway REST API Access Logging Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL restapi has access logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: REST APIs in AliCloud API Gateway should have access logging enabled
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of all API requests and responses. Without
  proper access logging, organizations cannot effectively monitor API usage patterns,
  detect suspicious activities, or meet compliance requirements for data access tracking.
  This creates significant security blind spots and hampers incident response capabilities.
