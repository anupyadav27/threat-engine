title: AliCloud Message Queue for Apache RocketMQ Broker Should Use Active-Active
  Deployment Mode
rationale: Ensures GENERAL broker has active active deployment mode properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Message Queue for Apache RocketMQ brokers are configured
  with active-active deployment mode to provide high availability and fault tolerance.
  Single-node deployments create single points of failure that can lead to message
  loss, service disruptions, and potential compliance violations for business continuity
  requirements. Active-active deployment mode enables automatic failover and maintains
  service availability during node failures.
