title: Ensure AliCloud Resource Access Management Least Privilege Assessment is Configured
rationale: Ensures GENERAL least_privilege_assessment_enabled has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that least privilege assessment is properly configured
  to continuously monitor and analyze permissions across AliCloud resources. Without
  this assessment enabled, organizations risk over-privileged access that could lead
  to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation attacks, and compliance violations
  with security frameworks requiring principle of least privilege implementation.
  Proper configuration helps identify unused permissions and recommends policy optimizations
  to minimize security exposure.
