title: Alibaba Cloud Container Registry Image Vulnerability Scanning Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL container has image vulnerability scanning enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that vulnerability scanning is enabled for container images in
  Alibaba Cloud Container Registry to detect security vulnerabilities, malware, and
  configuration issues. Without proper image scanning, organizations risk deploying
  compromised containers that could lead to data breaches, compliance violations,
  and security incidents in production environments.
