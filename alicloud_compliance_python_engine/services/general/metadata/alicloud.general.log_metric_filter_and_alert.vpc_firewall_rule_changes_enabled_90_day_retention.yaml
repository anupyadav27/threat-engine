title: Ensure Virtual Private Cloud Firewall Rule Changes Have Log Metric Filters
  and Alerts with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has vpc firewall rule changes
  enabled 90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Virtual Private Cloud firewall rule modifications
  are monitored through log metric filters with alerting mechanisms and maintain logs
  for at least 90 days. Inadequate monitoring of VPC security group and firewall changes
  can lead to undetected unauthorized access attempts and compliance violations. Proper
  logging and alerting enable rapid incident response and support forensic investigations
  for security breaches.
