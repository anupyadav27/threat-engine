title: Ensure Virtual Private Cloud Network Changes Have Log Metric Filters and Alerts
  with 90-Day Retention
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_metric_filter_and_alert has vpc network changes enabled
  90 day retention properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network configuration
  changes are monitored through log metric filters with alerting mechanisms and maintain
  logs for at least 90 days. Without proper monitoring and retention of VPC network
  changes, organizations cannot detect unauthorized network modifications, investigate
  security incidents effectively, or meet compliance requirements for audit trails.
  Inadequate logging retention may result in loss of critical forensic evidence during
  security investigations.
