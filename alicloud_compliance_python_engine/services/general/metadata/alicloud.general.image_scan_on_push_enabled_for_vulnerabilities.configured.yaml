rationale: Ensures GENERAL image_scan_on_push_enabled_for_vulnerabilities has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Container Registry has automatic image scanning
  enabled when images are pushed to repositories. This security control helps identify
  vulnerabilities, malware, and security issues in container images before they are
  deployed to production environments. Without this configuration, vulnerable container
  images may be deployed, exposing applications to security risks and potential compliance
  violations.
