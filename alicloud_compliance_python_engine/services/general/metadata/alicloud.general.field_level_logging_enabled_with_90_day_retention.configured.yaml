  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Field-level logging with adequate retention periods is essential for
  security monitoring, incident response, and compliance requirements. Without proper
  logging retention, organizations cannot effectively investigate security incidents,
  perform forensic analysis, or meet regulatory compliance standards that require
  audit trails. A 90-day retention period provides sufficient time for security teams
  to detect and respond to threats while maintaining historical data for compliance
  audits.
