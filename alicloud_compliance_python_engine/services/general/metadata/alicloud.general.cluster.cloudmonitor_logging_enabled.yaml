title: Ensure AliCloud Container Service for Kubernetes Clusters Have CloudMonitor
  Logging Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL cluster has cloudmonitor logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor logging is enabled for AliCloud
  Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) clusters to ensure comprehensive monitoring
  and audit trail collection. Without proper logging enabled, security incidents,
  performance issues, and compliance violations may go undetected, creating blind
  spots in cluster operations. Enabling CloudMonitor logging is essential for meeting
  security compliance requirements and maintaining operational visibility.
