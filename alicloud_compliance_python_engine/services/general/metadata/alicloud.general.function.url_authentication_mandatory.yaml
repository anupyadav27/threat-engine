title: AliCloud Function Compute URL Authentication Must Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL function has url authentication mandatory properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Function Compute functions have URL authentication enabled
  to prevent unauthorized access to function endpoints. Without proper authentication,
  function URLs can be accessed by anyone with knowledge of the endpoint, potentially
  leading to data exposure, unauthorized code execution, and compliance violations.
  This control is essential for maintaining secure serverless architectures and protecting
  sensitive business logic.
