  API Protection
rationale: Ensures GENERAL restapi has waf acl enforced properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control
  Lists (ACLs) are properly configured and enforced to protect REST API endpoints.
  Without proper WAF ACL enforcement, APIs are vulnerable to malicious attacks, data
  breaches, and unauthorized access attempts. This control is essential for maintaining
  API security posture and meeting compliance requirements for web application protection.
