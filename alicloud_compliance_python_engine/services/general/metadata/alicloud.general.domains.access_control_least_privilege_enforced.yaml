title: Alibaba Cloud Domain Name Service Access Control Least Privilege Enforced
rationale: Ensures GENERAL domains has access control least privilege enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that domain management access follows the principle of least
  privilege by restricting user permissions to only necessary domain operations. Inadequate
  access controls can lead to unauthorized domain modifications, DNS hijacking, or
  service disruptions that impact business continuity and regulatory compliance. Proper
  implementation reduces the attack surface and prevents privilege escalation in domain
  management systems.
