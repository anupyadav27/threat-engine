title: AliCloud Network Attached Storage File Share Encryption At Rest Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL fileshare has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud Network Attached Storage (NAS) file shares have
  encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without
  encryption at rest, data stored in file shares remains vulnerable to potential security
  breaches and may not meet compliance requirements for data protection standards
  such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or SOC 2. This security control is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and regulatory compliance.
