title: AliCloud Machine Learning Platform for AI Notebook Instances Should Not Have
  Direct Internet Access
rationale: Ensures GENERAL notebook_instance has no direct internet access properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Machine Learning Platform for AI notebook instances with direct internet
  access expose computational resources and sensitive data to potential external threats
  and unauthorized access. This configuration increases the attack surface and may
  violate data protection compliance requirements by allowing unrestricted network
  connectivity. Disabling direct internet access ensures notebook instances operate
  within controlled network boundaries with proper security controls.
