title: ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL Instance Should Have Disconnection Logging Flag
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance_postgres has disconnection logging flag enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that PostgreSQL instances have the log_disconnections parameter
  enabled to track database session terminations. This logging capability is essential
  for security monitoring, forensic analysis, and detecting potential unauthorized
  access attempts or abnormal connection patterns. Proper disconnection logging helps
  meet compliance requirements for audit trails and database activity monitoring.
