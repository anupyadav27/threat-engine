description: Windows file systems should be configured with multi-AZ deployment to
  ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. Single-AZ deployments
  create a single point of failure that can lead to service disruptions and potential
  data unavailability during zone-level outages. Multi-AZ configuration is essential
  for meeting business continuity requirements and compliance standards that mandate
  fault-tolerant infrastructure.
