title: Alibaba Cloud DataWorks Dataset CMK Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL dataset has cmk encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud DataWorks datasets are encrypted at rest using
  Customer Master Keys (CMK) for enhanced data protection. Without CMK encryption,
  sensitive data stored in datasets remains vulnerable to unauthorized access and
  may not meet regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR or industry-specific
  data protection standards. This control helps organizations maintain data confidentiality
  and meet security governance requirements.
