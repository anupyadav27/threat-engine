title: Alibaba Cloud API Gateway Access Restrictions Must Be Configured
rationale: Ensures GENERAL api has access restrictions configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that API Gateway instances have proper access restrictions configured
  to control client access and prevent unauthorized API consumption. Without proper
  access controls, APIs are exposed to potential abuse, data breaches, and compliance
  violations. This control helps maintain API security posture and meets regulatory
  requirements for access management.
