service: general
resource: instance
requirement: Attached Disks Encryption At Rest With Customer Managed Keys Enabled
scope: general.instance.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service Instance Attached Disks Use Customer-Managed
  Key Encryption at Rest
rationale: Ensures GENERAL instance has attached disks encryption at rest with customer
  managed keys enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all disks attached to ECS instances are encrypted
  at rest using customer-managed keys (CMK) rather than service-managed keys. Using
  customer-managed keys provides enhanced security control, ensures compliance with
  data sovereignty requirements, and reduces the risk of unauthorized data access
  in case of service compromise. Organizations can maintain full control over encryption
  key lifecycle, rotation policies, and access permissions.
