title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Log Service Collection is Properly Configured
rationale: Ensures GENERAL log_collection_enabled has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that log collection is properly enabled and configured
  across Alibaba Cloud services. Without proper log collection configuration, organizations
  lose critical visibility into security events, system activities, and potential
  threats, making incident response and compliance auditing significantly more difficult.
  Inadequate logging can result in non-compliance with regulatory frameworks that
  require comprehensive audit trails.
