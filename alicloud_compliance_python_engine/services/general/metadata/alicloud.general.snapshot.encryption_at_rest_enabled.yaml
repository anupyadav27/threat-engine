title: Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service Snapshots Must Have Encryption At Rest
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures GENERAL snapshot has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that all ECS disk snapshots are encrypted at rest to
  protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted snapshots expose data
  to potential security breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI
  DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2. Enabling encryption at rest provides an additional layer of
  security for backup data stored in Alibaba Cloud.
