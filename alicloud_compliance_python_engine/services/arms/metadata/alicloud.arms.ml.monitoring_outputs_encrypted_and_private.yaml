title: Application Real-Time Monitoring Service (ARMS) Machine Learning monitoring
  outputs should be encrypted and configured for private access
rationale: Ensures ARMS ml has monitoring outputs encrypted and private properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ARMS Machine Learning monitoring outputs are encrypted
