title: Application Real-Time Monitoring Service Machine Learning Private Networking
  Enforced
rationale: Ensures ARMS ml has monitoring private networking enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ARMS Machine Learning components are configured to use private
  networking exclusively, preventing exposure to public internet traffic. This configuration
  reduces attack surface by eliminating unauthorized external access and protects
  sensitive monitoring data and ML model inference traffic. Non-compliance may lead
  to data breaches and violation of data protection regulations.
