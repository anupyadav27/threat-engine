  Fields
rationale: Ensures ARMS api has monitoring api access log fields identity present
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ARMS API access logs contain identity fields to track user
  and service account activities. Missing identity information in API logs creates
  security blind spots that prevent effective incident response, compliance auditing,
  and detection of unauthorized access attempts. This requirement is essential for
  maintaining audit trails and meeting regulatory compliance standards.
