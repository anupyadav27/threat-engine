title: Application Real-Time Monitoring Service (ARMS) Tracing Sampling Rule Storage
  Should Be Encrypted
rationale: Ensures ARMS tracing_sampling_rule has sampling rule storage encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ARMS tracing sampling rule storage is encrypted to protect
  sensitive application performance data and tracing configurations. Unencrypted sampling
  rule storage exposes application topology, performance metrics, and business logic
  patterns to unauthorized access. This encryption requirement is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality and meeting compliance standards for application monitoring
  data.
