title: Ensure Application Security Review Disaster Recovery Drill Testing Execution
  Roles Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures ASR dr_drills_tests has testing execution roles least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that IAM roles used for executing disaster recovery
  drill tests in Application Security Review service adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. Overprivileged testing roles can expose sensitive production data during
  DR simulations and create potential attack vectors for privilege escalation. Non-compliance
  increases security risks during business continuity testing and may violate regulatory
  requirements for access control segregation.
