title: Ensure Application Security Reinforcement DR Drill Testing Results Storage
  is Encrypted and Private
rationale: Ensures ASR dr_drills_tests has testing results storage encrypted and private
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that disaster recovery drill testing results stored
  by Application Security Reinforcement are encrypted at rest and configured with
  private access controls. Unencrypted or publicly accessible testing results can
  expose sensitive security assessment data, vulnerability information, and system
  architecture details to unauthorized parties. Proper encryption and access controls
  are essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements
  for security testing documentation.
