title: Application Service Recovery Instance Security Groups Should Follow Restrictive
  Access Policies
rationale: Ensures ASR recovery_instance has security groups restrictive properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Service Recovery (ASR) instances are protected
  by security groups with restrictive inbound and outbound rules. Overly permissive
  security group configurations can expose recovery instances to unauthorized access,
  potentially compromising disaster recovery operations and violating compliance requirements.
  Restrictive security groups help maintain the principle of least privilege for critical
  recovery infrastructure.
