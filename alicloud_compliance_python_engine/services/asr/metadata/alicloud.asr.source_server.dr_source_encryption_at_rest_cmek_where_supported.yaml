service: asr
resource: source_server
requirement: Dr Source Encryption At Rest Cmek Where Supported
scope: asr.source_server.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Application Server Recovery (ASR) disaster recovery source servers should use
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for data at rest encryption where supported
rationale: Ensures ASR source_server has dr source encryption at rest cmek where supported
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ASR disaster recovery source servers implement
  encryption at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) rather than service-managed
  keys. Using CMEK provides enhanced security control and compliance capabilities
  by allowing organizations to manage their own encryption keys, meeting regulatory
  requirements for data protection and reducing risks associated with unauthorized
  data access during disaster recovery operations.
