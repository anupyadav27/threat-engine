subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Alibaba Cloud Application Service Recovery recovery instance volumes should
  be encrypted
rationale: Ensures ASR recovery_instance has volumes encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that all volumes attached to Application Service Recovery
  (ASR) recovery instances are encrypted at rest. Unencrypted volumes expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized access and may violate data protection regulations such as
  GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Enabling volume encryption protects against data breaches
  in case of physical media theft or unauthorized access to storage infrastructure.
