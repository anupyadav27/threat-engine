title: Data Transmission Service Disaster Recovery Replication Must Use TLS Encryption
  in Transit
rationale: Ensures DTS dr has replication encryption in transit tls required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Transmission Service (DTS) disaster recovery replication
  channels are configured with TLS encryption to protect data in transit. Unencrypted
  replication exposes sensitive data to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks
  during transmission between source and target databases. This control is essential
  for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements for data
  protection regulations.
