requirement: Critical Vulnerabilities Blocked
scope: cr.image.security
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Ensure Container Registry images with critical vulnerabilities are blocked
  from deployment
rationale: Ensures CR image has critical vulnerabilities blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Container Registry has security policies configured
  to automatically block container images containing critical severity vulnerabilities
  from being deployed. Allowing images with critical vulnerabilities increases the
  risk of security breaches and may violate compliance requirements for secure software
  supply chain practices.
