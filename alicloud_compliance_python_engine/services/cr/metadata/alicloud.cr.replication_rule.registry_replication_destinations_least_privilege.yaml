title: Container Registry Replication Rule Should Follow Least Privilege Access for
  Destination Registries
rationale: Ensures CR replication_rule has registry replication destinations least
  privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Container Registry replication rules are configured with
  minimal necessary permissions for destination registries. Overly permissive replication
  destinations can lead to unauthorized access to container images and potential data
  breaches. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks by enforcing
  the principle of least privilege for cross-registry replication operations.
