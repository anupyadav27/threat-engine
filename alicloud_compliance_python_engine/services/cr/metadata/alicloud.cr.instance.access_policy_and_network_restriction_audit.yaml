title: Container Registry Instance Access Policy and Network Restriction Audit
rationale: Ensures CR instance has access policy and network restriction audit properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Audits access policies and network restrictions configured for Container
  Registry instances to ensure proper security controls are in place. Inadequate access
  controls can lead to unauthorized image access, potential data breaches, and compliance
  violations with security frameworks requiring least-privilege access principles.
  This check helps maintain secure container image repositories by validating that
  appropriate network and access restrictions are properly configured.
