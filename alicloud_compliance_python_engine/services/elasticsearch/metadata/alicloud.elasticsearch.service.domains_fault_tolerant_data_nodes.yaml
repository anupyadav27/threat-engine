title: Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch Service domains should have fault tolerant data
  nodes configured
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH service has domains fault tolerant data nodes properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures Elasticsearch Service domains are configured with multiple data
  nodes across different availability zones to maintain high availability and prevent
  data loss. Single data node configurations create critical points of failure that
  can result in service outages and potential data loss, violating business continuity
  and disaster recovery compliance requirements.
