severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud Elasticsearch Service Documentation Storage is Encrypted and
  Private
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH confluence_n_a_service has documentation storage
  encrypted and private properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that Elasticsearch Service clusters have proper encryption
  enabled for data storage and are configured with private access controls. Unencrypted
  documentation storage can expose sensitive business data and violate compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and PCI DSS. Private access configuration prevents unauthorized
  external access to critical search and analytics data.
