title: Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch Domain Public Access Should Be Blocked
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH domain has public access blocked properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch domains are not accessible from
  the public internet to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Public access
  to Elasticsearch clusters can expose sensitive data and search indices to malicious
  actors, potentially leading to data exfiltration or service disruption. This control
  helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations and security best practices.
