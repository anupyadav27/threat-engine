title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch Service Domains Have CloudWatch Logging
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures ELASTICSEARCH service has domains cloudwatch logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Elasticsearch Service domains have CloudWatch
  logging enabled to capture search slow logs, index slow logs, and error logs. Without
  proper logging enabled, security incidents, performance issues, and unauthorized
  access attempts may go undetected, hindering compliance with audit requirements
  and incident response capabilities. Enabling comprehensive logging is essential
  for maintaining security visibility and meeting regulatory compliance standards.
