title: DataWorks Metadata Registry Should Implement RBAC Least Privilege Access Controls
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS metadata has registry rbac least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks metadata registry implements role-based access
  control (RBAC) with least privilege principles to restrict user permissions to only
  necessary resources and operations. Excessive permissions in metadata registries
  can lead to unauthorized data access, metadata tampering, and compliance violations
  with data governance regulations. Proper RBAC implementation reduces the attack
  surface and maintains data lineage integrity.
