title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Data Governance Policy Administrator Change Audit
  Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS governance_data has policy admin change audit logging
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for policy administrator
  changes within DataWorks Data Governance to maintain proper access control oversight.
  Without proper audit logging of administrative policy modifications, organizations
  cannot track unauthorized privilege escalations or policy tampering that could lead
  to data breaches. This monitoring is essential for compliance frameworks requiring
  administrative action auditability and maintaining data governance integrity.
