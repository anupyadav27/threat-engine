title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Data Catalogs Are Not Publicly Accessible
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data has catalogs not publicly accessible properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks data catalogs are not configured with
  public access permissions, preventing unauthorized exposure of sensitive metadata
  and data schemas. Public accessibility of data catalogs can lead to information
  disclosure vulnerabilities and potential compliance violations with data protection
  regulations. Proper access controls ensure that only authorized users and applications
  can discover and access catalog information.
