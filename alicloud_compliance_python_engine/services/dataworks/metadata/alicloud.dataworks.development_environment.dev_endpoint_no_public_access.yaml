severity: high
title: AliCloud DataWorks Development Environment Endpoint Should Not Allow Public
  Access
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS development_environment has dev endpoint no public access
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks development environment endpoints are not accessible
  from the public internet to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data processing
  environments. Public access to development endpoints can expose proprietary code,
  data pipelines, and development resources to potential security threats, violating
  data protection compliance requirements and increasing the attack surface.
