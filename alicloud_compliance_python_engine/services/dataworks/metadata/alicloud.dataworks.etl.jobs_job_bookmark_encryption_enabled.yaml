  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks ETL jobs have job bookmark encryption

  processing state and metadata that could expose data patterns or processing logic
  if compromised. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements for data
  protection standards and prevents unauthorized access to job execution details.
