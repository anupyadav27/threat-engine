title: AliCloud DataWorks Data Map Catalog Audit Logging Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS datamap_catalog has catalog audit logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that audit logging is enabled for DataWorks Data Map catalogs
  to track data access, modifications, and administrative operations. Without proper
  audit logging, organizations cannot monitor data governance activities, detect unauthorized
  access to sensitive data assets, or maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
  This control is essential for maintaining data lineage visibility and meeting audit
  requirements for data management platforms.
