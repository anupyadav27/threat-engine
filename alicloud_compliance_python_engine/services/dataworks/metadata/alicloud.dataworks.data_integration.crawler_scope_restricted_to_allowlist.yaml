title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Data Integration Crawler Scope is Restricted to Allowlist
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_integration has crawler scope restricted to allowlist
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks data integration crawlers are configured
  with restricted scope using allowlists to limit data discovery and access. Unrestricted
  crawler scope can lead to unauthorized data exposure, compliance violations, and
  potential data breaches by allowing crawlers to access sensitive data sources beyond
  intended boundaries. Proper allowlist configuration ensures data governance compliance
  and reduces the attack surface for data exfiltration.
