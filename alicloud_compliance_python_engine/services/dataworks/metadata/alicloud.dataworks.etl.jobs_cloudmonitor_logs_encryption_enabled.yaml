service: dataworks
resource: etl
requirement: Jobs Cloudmonitor Logs Encryption Enabled
scope: dataworks.etl.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure DataWorks ETL Jobs CloudMonitor Logs Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS etl has jobs cloudmonitor logs encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for CloudMonitor logs generated
  by DataWorks ETL jobs. Unencrypted logs may expose sensitive data processing information,
  job execution details, and potentially confidential business data in transit and
  at rest. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements and protects against
  unauthorized access to operational logs.
