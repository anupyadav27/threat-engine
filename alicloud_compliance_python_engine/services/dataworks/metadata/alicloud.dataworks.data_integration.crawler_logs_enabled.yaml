title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Data Integration Crawler Logs Are Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS data_integration has crawler logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for DataWorks Data Integration
  crawlers to maintain proper audit trails and security monitoring. Without crawler
  logs enabled, organizations cannot track data discovery activities, troubleshoot
  integration issues, or detect potential security incidents involving sensitive data
  crawling operations. Proper logging is essential for compliance with data governance
  requirements and security incident response procedures.
