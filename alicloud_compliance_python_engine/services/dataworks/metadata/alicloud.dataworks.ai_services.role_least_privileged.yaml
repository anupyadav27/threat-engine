scope: dataworks.ai_services.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege

title: Ensure DataWorks AI Services roles follow least privilege principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS ai_services has role least privileged properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks AI Services roles are configured with
  minimal necessary permissions to reduce security risks. Overprivileged roles can
  lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data processing workflows and AI model
  resources, potentially violating data protection compliance requirements. Implementing
  least privilege access controls helps minimize the attack surface and ensures proper
  segregation of duties.
