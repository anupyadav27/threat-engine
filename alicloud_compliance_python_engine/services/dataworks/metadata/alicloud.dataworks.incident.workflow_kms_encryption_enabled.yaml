rule_id: alicloud.dataworks.incident.workflow_kms_encryption_enabled
service: dataworks
resource: incident
requirement: Workflow KMS Encryption Enabled
scope: dataworks.incident.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Workflow KMS Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS incident has workflow kms encryption enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks workflows have KMS encryption enabled
  to protect sensitive data processing logic and parameters. Without proper encryption,
  workflow configurations and data transformation rules may be exposed to unauthorized
  access, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Enabling
  KMS encryption ensures that workflow metadata and execution details are encrypted
  at rest using customer-managed or service-managed keys.
