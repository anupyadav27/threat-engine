severity: medium
title: Ensure DataWorks Data Quality Center Output Location is Private and Encrypted
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS dqc has data quality output location private and encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks Data Quality Center (DQC) output locations
  are configured with private access controls and encryption at rest. Unencrypted
  or publicly accessible data quality outputs can expose sensitive data profiling
  results and quality metrics, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations with regulations like GDPR or industry standards. Proper encryption and
  private access ensure data quality assessment results remain confidential and meet
  security requirements.
