title: Alibaba Cloud DataWorks Database Cross-Account Sharing Should Be Restricted
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS database has cross account sharing restricted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks databases are not shared across different Alibaba
  Cloud accounts without proper authorization controls. Unrestricted cross-account
  database sharing can lead to unauthorized data access, data breaches, and compliance
  violations with data governance regulations. This control helps maintain data isolation
  and prevents inadvertent exposure of sensitive information to external accounts.
