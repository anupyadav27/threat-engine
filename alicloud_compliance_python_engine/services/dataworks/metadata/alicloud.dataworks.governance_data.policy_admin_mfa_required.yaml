description: Ensures that policy administrators in DataWorks data governance have
  multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled for their accounts. Without MFA, privileged
  accounts are vulnerable to credential-based attacks that could lead to unauthorized
  data access, policy manipulation, and compliance violations. This control is essential
  for maintaining data governance integrity and meeting regulatory requirements for
  privileged access management.
