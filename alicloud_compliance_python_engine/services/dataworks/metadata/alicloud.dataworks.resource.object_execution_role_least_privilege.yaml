service: dataworks
resource: resource
requirement: Object Execution Role Least Privilege
scope: dataworks.resource.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Object Execution Roles Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS resource has object execution role least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks object execution roles are configured
  with minimal necessary permissions to perform their intended functions. Excessive
  permissions in execution roles can lead to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized
  access to sensitive data processing workflows. Proper role configuration is essential
  for maintaining data governance compliance and reducing the attack surface in data
  pipeline operations.
