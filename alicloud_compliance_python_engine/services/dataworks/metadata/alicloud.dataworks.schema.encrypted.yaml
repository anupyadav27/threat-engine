title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks schema encryption is enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS schema has encrypted properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataWorks schemas should have encryption enabled to protect sensitive
  data definitions and metadata from unauthorized access. Unencrypted schemas expose
  data structure information and potentially sensitive business logic, creating compliance
  risks under data protection regulations. This control ensures data governance requirements
  are met through proper encryption of schema configurations.
