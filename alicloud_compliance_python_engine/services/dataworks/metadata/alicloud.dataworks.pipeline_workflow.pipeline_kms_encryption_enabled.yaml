subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure DataWorks Pipeline Workflows Have KMS Encryption Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS pipeline_workflow has pipeline kms encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks pipeline workflows are configured with
  KMS encryption to protect sensitive data during processing and storage. Without
  proper encryption, pipeline data may be exposed to unauthorized access, potentially
  violating data protection regulations and compromising business-critical information.
  Enabling KMS encryption ensures data confidentiality and helps meet compliance requirements
  for data governance frameworks.
