title: Ensure DataWorks Database Has PII Detection Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS database has pii detection enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection
  is enabled for DataWorks databases to automatically identify and classify sensitive
  data. Without PII detection, organizations risk exposing personal data in violation
  of privacy regulations like GDPR and may fail to implement proper data governance
  controls. Enabling PII detection helps maintain compliance and prevents unauthorized
  access to sensitive personal information.
