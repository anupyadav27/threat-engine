title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks Job Scripts Are Stored in Private and Encrypted Locations
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS tasks_jobs has job script location private and encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that DataWorks job scripts are stored in private,
  encrypted storage locations to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive code and
  data processing logic. Unencrypted or publicly accessible job scripts can expose
  business logic, database connections, and sensitive data transformation processes,
  leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Proper encryption
  and access controls are essential for maintaining data security and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
