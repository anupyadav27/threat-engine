title: AliCloud DataWorks Workflow Approval Steps Required For Destructive Actions
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS incident has workflow approval steps required for destructive
  actions properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DataWorks workflows implement mandatory approval steps before
  executing destructive operations such as data deletion, table drops, or schema modifications.
  Without proper approval mechanisms, unauthorized or accidental destructive actions
  can lead to irreversible data loss, compliance violations, and business continuity
  disruptions. This control helps maintain data governance and regulatory compliance
  by enforcing human oversight for high-risk operations.
