title: Ensure AliCloud DataWorks MaxCompute Project Database Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAWORKS maxcompute_project has database encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that database encryption is enabled for MaxCompute
