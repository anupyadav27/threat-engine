title: Ensure AliCloud Cloud Firewall Microsegmentation Identity-Aware Policies Are
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures CFW microsegmentation has microseg identity aware policies enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that identity-aware policies are enabled for Cloud
  Firewall microsegmentation to provide granular access control based on user and
  device identity. Without identity-aware policies, network segmentation relies solely
  on IP-based rules, which can be bypassed and fail to provide adequate protection
  against lateral movement attacks. Enabling this feature enhances zero-trust security
  posture and helps meet compliance requirements for identity-based access controls.
