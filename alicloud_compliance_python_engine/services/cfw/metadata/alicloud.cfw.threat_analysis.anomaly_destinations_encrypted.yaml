resource: threat_analysis
requirement: Anomaly Destinations Encrypted
scope: cfw.threat_analysis.security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Cloud Firewall Threat Analysis Should Monitor Encrypted Traffic to Anomaly
  Destinations
rationale: Ensures CFW threat_analysis has anomaly destinations encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Cloud Firewall threat analysis monitors and analyzes encrypted
  traffic flows to anomalous destinations to detect potential data exfiltration or
  command-and-control communications. Unmonitored encrypted traffic to suspicious
  destinations can bypass security controls and hide malicious activities, potentially
  leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This control is essential for
  maintaining comprehensive network security visibility and meeting regulatory requirements
  for traffic monitoring.
