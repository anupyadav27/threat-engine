subcategory: security_monitoring

title: Ensure Cloud Firewall IP Sets contain valid and minimized CIDR blocks
rationale: Ensures CFW ipset has ip set cidrs valid and minimized properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule validates that IP sets in Cloud Firewall contain properly formatted
  CIDR blocks and are minimized to reduce attack surface. Invalid or overly broad
  CIDR ranges can lead to unintended network access, security policy bypass, and compliance
  violations. Properly configured IP sets ensure precise network access control and
  maintain security boundaries.
