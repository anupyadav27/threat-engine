title: Alibaba Cloud Certificate Authority Service Certificate Key Length Minimum
  Requirements
rationale: Ensures CAS cas has certificate key length minimum properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures SSL/TLS certificates managed by Alibaba Cloud Certificate Authority
  Service meet minimum key length requirements to maintain cryptographic strength.
  Weak key lengths below industry standards (typically less than 2048 bits for RSA)
  can be vulnerable to brute force attacks and may not meet compliance requirements
  for data protection regulations. This control helps maintain the integrity of encrypted
  communications and prevents the use of cryptographically weak certificates.
