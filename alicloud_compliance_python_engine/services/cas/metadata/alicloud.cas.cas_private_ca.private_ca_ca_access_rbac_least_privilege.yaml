  Access Controls
rationale: Ensures CAS cas_private_ca has private ca ca access rbac least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Certificate Authority Service Private CA instances implement
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege principles to restrict certificate
  management operations. Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized certificate
  issuance, compromised PKI infrastructure, and potential security breaches affecting
  encrypted communications. Proper RBAC implementation is essential for compliance
  with security frameworks and maintaining certificate authority integrity.
