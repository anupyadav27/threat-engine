title: AliCloud DevOps Project Variables Should Not Contain Hardcoded Secrets
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has no secrets in variables properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that AliCloud DevOps project variables do not contain
  hardcoded secrets such as passwords, API keys, or tokens. Storing secrets in plain
  text variables creates significant security risks including credential exposure
  in logs, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, and potential compliance violations.
  Organizations should use secure secret management solutions instead of embedding
  sensitive data directly in project variables.
