title: Ensure AliCloud DevOps Project Object Storage Service Logs Are Encrypted
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has oss logs encrypted properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that OSS logs generated by DevOps projects are encrypted
  at rest to protect sensitive build and deployment information. Unencrypted logs
  expose source code details, deployment configurations, and potentially credentials
  to unauthorized access. Proper encryption helps maintain compliance with data protection
  regulations and prevents data breaches through log file exposure.
