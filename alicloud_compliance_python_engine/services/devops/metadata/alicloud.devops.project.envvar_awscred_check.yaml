requirement: Envvar Awscred Check
scope: devops.project.security

subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: AliCloud DevOps Project Environment Variables Should Not Contain AWS Credentials
rationale: Ensures DEVOPS project has envvar awscred check properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule detects AWS credentials stored in environment variables within
  AliCloud DevOps projects, which poses significant security risks including credential
  exposure and unauthorized access to AWS resources. Storing sensitive credentials
  in environment variables violates security best practices and compliance requirements,
  as they can be easily accessed by unauthorized users or exposed in logs and configuration
  files.
