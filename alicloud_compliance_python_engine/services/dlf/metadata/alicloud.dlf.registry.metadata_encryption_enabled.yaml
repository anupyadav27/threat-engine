title: Ensure Data Lake Formation Registry Has Metadata Encryption Enabled
rationale: Ensures DLF registry has metadata encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud Data Lake Formation registry instances
  have metadata encryption enabled to protect sensitive data catalog information.
  Without proper encryption, metadata containing schema definitions, table structures,
  and data lineage information could be exposed to unauthorized access, potentially
  leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Enabling metadata encryption
  is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting regulatory requirements
  for data protection.
