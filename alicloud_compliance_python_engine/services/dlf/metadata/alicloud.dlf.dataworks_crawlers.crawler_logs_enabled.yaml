title: Ensure Data Lake Formation DataWorks Crawlers Have Logging Enabled
rationale: Ensures DLF dataworks_crawlers has crawler logs enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for DataWorks crawlers in
  Data Lake Formation to maintain proper audit trails and security monitoring. Without
  crawler logging enabled, organizations lose visibility into data discovery activities,
  making it difficult to detect unauthorized access patterns or compliance violations.
  Proper logging is essential for meeting data governance requirements and security
  incident response capabilities.
