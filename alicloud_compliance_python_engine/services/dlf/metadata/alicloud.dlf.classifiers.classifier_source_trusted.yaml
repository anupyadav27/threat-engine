title: Ensure Data Lake Formation Classifier Sources Are From Trusted Origins
rationale: Ensures DLF classifiers has classifier source trusted properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Data Lake Formation classifiers are configured
  to use only trusted data sources and repositories. Untrusted classifier sources
  can lead to data poisoning attacks, compromised data classification accuracy, and
  potential compliance violations in data governance frameworks. Ensuring classifier
  source integrity is critical for maintaining reliable automated data discovery and
  classification processes.
