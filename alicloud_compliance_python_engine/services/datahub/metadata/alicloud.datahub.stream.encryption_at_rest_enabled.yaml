severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud DataHub Stream Has Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Ensures DATAHUB stream has encryption at rest enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that AliCloud DataHub streams have encryption at rest
  enabled to protect sensitive data stored within the stream. Without encryption at
  rest, data stored in DataHub streams remains vulnerable to unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches, which can lead to compliance violations with data protection
  regulations. Enabling encryption at rest ensures that data is automatically encrypted
  when written to storage and decrypted when accessed by authorized applications.
