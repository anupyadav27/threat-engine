title: Alibaba Cloud DataHub Stream Should Follow Least Privilege Access Control
rationale: Ensures DATAHUB stream has least privilege properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataHub streams should implement least privilege access control to minimize
  security risks and prevent unauthorized data access. Overly permissive access policies
  can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and unauthorized stream operations.
  Proper access control ensures only necessary permissions are granted to users and
  applications accessing streaming data.
