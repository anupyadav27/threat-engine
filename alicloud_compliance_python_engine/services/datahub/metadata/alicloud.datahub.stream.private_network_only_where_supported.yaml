title: Ensure AliCloud DataHub streams are configured for private network access only
  where supported
rationale: Ensures DATAHUB stream has private network only where supported properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DataHub streams should be configured to allow access only through private
  networks (VPC) rather than public internet endpoints where this capability is supported.
  Public network access exposes data streams to potential unauthorized access and
  increases the attack surface. This configuration helps maintain data confidentiality
  and supports compliance with data protection regulations requiring network-level
  access controls.
