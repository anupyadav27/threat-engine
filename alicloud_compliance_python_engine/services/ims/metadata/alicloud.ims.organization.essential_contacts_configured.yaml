  Configured
rationale: Ensures IMS organization has essential contacts configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that essential contacts are properly configured for AliCloud
  IMS organizations to enable critical security notifications and incident response
  communications. Without configured essential contacts, organizations may miss critical
  security alerts, compliance notifications, and incident response communications,
  potentially leading to delayed threat response and regulatory compliance violations.

  timely communication during security events.
