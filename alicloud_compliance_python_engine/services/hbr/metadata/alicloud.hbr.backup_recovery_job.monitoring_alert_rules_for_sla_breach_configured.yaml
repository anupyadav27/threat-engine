title: Hybrid Backup Recovery Jobs Must Have Monitoring Alert Rules Configured for
  SLA Breach Detection
rationale: Ensures HBR backup_recovery_job has monitoring alert rules for sla breach
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery (HBR) jobs have proper monitoring
  alert rules configured to detect SLA breaches and backup failures. Without these
  alerts, organizations may not be aware of backup job failures or performance degradation,
  potentially leading to data loss scenarios and compliance violations. This monitoring
  is critical for maintaining business continuity and meeting regulatory requirements
  for data protection.
