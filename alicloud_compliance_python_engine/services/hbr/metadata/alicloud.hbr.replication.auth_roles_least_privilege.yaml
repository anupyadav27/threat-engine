subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Hybrid Backup Recovery replication should use roles with least privilege access
rationale: Ensures HBR replication has auth roles least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery replication operations use IAM roles
  with minimal required permissions rather than overly permissive access. Excessive
  permissions increase the risk of unauthorized data access, privilege escalation,
  and potential data breaches during backup replication processes. This control helps
  maintain compliance with security frameworks requiring principle of least privilege
  implementation.
