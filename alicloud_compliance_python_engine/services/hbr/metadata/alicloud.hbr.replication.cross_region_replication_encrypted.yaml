title: Hybrid Backup Recovery Cross-Region Replication Should Use Encryption
rationale: Ensures HBR replication has cross region replication encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery cross-region replication jobs are
  configured with encryption to protect backup data during transit and storage across
  regions. Unencrypted cross-region replication exposes sensitive backup data to potential
  interception and unauthorized access, violating data protection compliance requirements.
  This control is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting regulatory
  standards for backup security.
