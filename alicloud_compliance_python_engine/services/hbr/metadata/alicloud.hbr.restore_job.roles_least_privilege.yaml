title: Hybrid Backup Recovery restore jobs should use roles with least privilege access
rationale: Ensures HBR restore_job has roles least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Hybrid Backup Recovery restore job operations are performed
  using IAM roles with minimal required permissions. Overprivileged roles can lead
  to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation attacks, and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege access reduces the
  blast radius of potential security incidents during backup restoration processes.
