title: Function Compute Trigger Event Source Permissions Should Follow Least Privilege
  Principle
rationale: Ensures FC trigger has event source permissions least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Function Compute triggers are configured with minimal necessary
  permissions for their event sources to reduce security risks. Overly permissive
  event source configurations can lead to unauthorized function invocations, data
  exposure, and potential privilege escalation attacks. This control helps maintain
  compliance with security frameworks requiring least privilege access controls.
