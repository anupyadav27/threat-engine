title: Alibaba Cloud Function Compute functions should have VPC isolation enabled
rationale: Ensures FC function has vpc isolation enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute functions without VPC isolation are exposed to the public
  internet, increasing attack surface and potential unauthorized access risks. VPC
  isolation provides network-level security controls and helps meet compliance requirements
  for data protection and network segmentation.
