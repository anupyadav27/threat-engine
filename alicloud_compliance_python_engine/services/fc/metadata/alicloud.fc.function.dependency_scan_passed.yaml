title: Function Compute functions should pass dependency vulnerability scans
rationale: Ensures FC function has dependency scan passed properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute functions must undergo dependency scanning to identify
  known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and packages. Vulnerable dependencies
  can expose functions to security exploits, data breaches, and compliance violations.
  Regular dependency scanning helps maintain secure serverless applications and meets
  security compliance requirements.
