title: Function Compute minimum TLS version 1.2 should be enforced
rationale: Ensures FC minimum_tls_version_1_2_enforced has configured properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute services should enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher to
  ensure secure communication and protect against protocol downgrade attacks. Using
  outdated TLS versions exposes applications to known cryptographic vulnerabilities
  and may result in non-compliance with security standards and regulations. Enforcing
  minimum TLS 1.2 helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity during transmission.
