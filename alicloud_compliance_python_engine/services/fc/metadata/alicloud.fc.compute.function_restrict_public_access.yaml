service: fc
resource: compute
requirement: Function Restrict Public Access
scope: fc.compute.public_access
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Function Compute functions restrict public access
rationale: Ensures FC compute has function restrict public access properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Function Compute functions should not be publicly accessible to prevent
  unauthorized invocation and potential data exposure. Public access can lead to unexpected
  charges, security breaches, and compliance violations. Restricting access through
  proper authentication and authorization mechanisms ensures functions are only accessible
  by authorized users and services.
