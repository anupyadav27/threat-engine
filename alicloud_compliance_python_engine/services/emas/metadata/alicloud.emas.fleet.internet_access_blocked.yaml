title: Ensure Enterprise Mobile Application Studio (EMAS) Fleet Internet Access is
  Blocked
rationale: Ensures EMAS fleet has internet access blocked properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that EMAS fleet configurations have internet access
  properly blocked to prevent unauthorized external communications. Unrestricted internet
  access from mobile application fleets can expose sensitive data to external threats
  and create potential attack vectors. Blocking internet access helps maintain compliance
  with data protection regulations and reduces the attack surface for mobile applications.
