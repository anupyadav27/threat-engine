domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: private_connectivity
severity: medium
title: Ensure Realtime Compute for Apache Flink Analytics Network is Private Only
rationale: Ensures FLINK compute_for_apache_flink has analytics network private only
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Realtime Compute for Apache Flink workspaces
  are configured with private network access only, preventing exposure to the public
  internet. Public network access increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive data processing workloads. Implementing private-only network
  access helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations and enterprise
  security policies.
