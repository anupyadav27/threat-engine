service: dns
resource: service
requirement: Rsasha1 Deprecated For Zone Signing In Dnssec
scope: dns.service.security
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Alibaba Cloud DNS should not use deprecated RSASHA1 algorithm for DNSSEC zone
  signing
rationale: Ensures DNS service has rsasha1 deprecated for zone signing in dnssec properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Alibaba Cloud DNS zones do not use the deprecated
  RSASHA1 algorithm for DNSSEC zone signing. The RSASHA1 algorithm is considered cryptographically
  weak and vulnerable to collision attacks, which can compromise DNS security and
  integrity. Using deprecated algorithms may also result in non-compliance with modern
  security standards and DNS security best practices.
