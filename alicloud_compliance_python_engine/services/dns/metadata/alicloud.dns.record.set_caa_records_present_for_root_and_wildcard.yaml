title: Ensure CAA Records Are Present for Root and Wildcard Domains in Alibaba Cloud
  DNS
rationale: Ensures DNS record has set caa records present for root and wildcard properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) records must be configured
  for both root and wildcard domains to prevent unauthorized SSL/TLS certificate issuance.
  Missing CAA records expose domains to certificate-based attacks and man-in-the-middle
  exploits, potentially compromising data integrity and failing compliance requirements
  for secure communications.
