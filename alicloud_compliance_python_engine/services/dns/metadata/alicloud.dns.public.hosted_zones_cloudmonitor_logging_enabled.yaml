title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud DNS Public Hosted Zones Have CloudMonitor Logging Enabled
rationale: Ensures DNS public has hosted zones cloudmonitor logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor logging is enabled for public hosted
  zones in Alibaba Cloud DNS service. Without proper logging enabled, DNS query activities
  and potential security threats cannot be monitored or analyzed, creating blind spots
  in network security monitoring. Enabling CloudMonitor logging is essential for compliance
  requirements and helps detect DNS-based attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and
  suspicious query patterns.
