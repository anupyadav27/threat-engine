service: hologres
resource: database
requirement: Cluster Private Networking Enforced
scope: hologres.database.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: private_connectivity
severity: medium
title: Ensure AliCloud Hologres Database Cluster Private Networking is Enforced
rationale: Ensures HOLOGRES database has cluster private networking enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Hologres database clusters are configured to
  use private networking exclusively, preventing direct internet access. Enforcing
  private networking reduces the attack surface by ensuring database traffic flows
  through secure internal networks only. Non-compliance increases risks of unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and may violate regulatory requirements for data protection.
