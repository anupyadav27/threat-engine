subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure ActionTrail logs have Object Storage Service bucket access logging enabled
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail logs has s3 bucket access logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets storing
  ActionTrail logs have access logging enabled to track all bucket operations. Without
  access logging, organizations cannot monitor who accessed audit logs, potentially
  missing unauthorized access attempts or compliance violations. This is critical
  for maintaining audit trail integrity and meeting regulatory requirements for log
  monitoring.
