title: Ensure ActionTrail Data Events Read Logging is Enabled for Object Storage Service
  Buckets
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail oss has dataevents read logging enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is configured to log data events
  for read operations on Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets. Without proper data
  event logging, organizations cannot track unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration
  activities, or maintain adequate audit trails for compliance requirements. Enabling
  read logging is essential for security monitoring and forensic analysis of OSS bucket
  access patterns.
