service: actiontrail
resource: vpc
requirement: Change Monitoring
scope: actiontrail.vpc.monitoring
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: medium
title: Ensure ActionTrail monitors Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration changes
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail vpc has change monitoring properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is configured to monitor and log
  all VPC configuration changes including network modifications, security group updates,
  and routing table changes. Proper VPC change monitoring is essential for detecting
  unauthorized network modifications that could compromise network security and is
  required for compliance frameworks like ISO 27001 and SOC 2. Without comprehensive
  VPC monitoring, organizations may miss critical security events that could lead
  to data breaches or network compromises.
