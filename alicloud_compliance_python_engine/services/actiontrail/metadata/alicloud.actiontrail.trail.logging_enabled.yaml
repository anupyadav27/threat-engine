title: Ensure AliCloud ActionTrail Trail Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail trail has logging enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: ActionTrail trails must have logging enabled to capture and record API
  calls and management events across AliCloud services. Without active logging, security
  incidents cannot be properly investigated, compliance requirements may be violated,
  and unauthorized activities will go undetected. This creates significant security
  blind spots and regulatory compliance risks.
