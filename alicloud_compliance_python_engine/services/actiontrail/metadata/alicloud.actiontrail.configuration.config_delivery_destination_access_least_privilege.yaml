rule_id: alicloud.actiontrail.configuration.config_delivery_destination_access_least_privilege
service: actiontrail
resource: configuration
requirement: Config Delivery Destination Access Least Privilege
scope: actiontrail.configuration.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Ensure ActionTrail Configuration Delivery Destination Access Follows Least
  Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail configuration has config delivery destination access
  least privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail configuration delivery destinations
  (OSS buckets, Log Service projects) are configured with minimal necessary permissions
  to prevent unauthorized access to audit logs. Excessive permissions on delivery
  destinations can lead to log tampering, data breaches, and compliance violations
  with security frameworks requiring proper audit trail protection.
