title: Ensure AliCloud ActionTrail OSS Write Events Logging is Configured
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail oss_write_events_logging_enabled has configured properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail is properly configured to log Object
  Storage Service (OSS) write events, which include operations like object uploads,
  deletions, and modifications. Without proper OSS write event logging, organizations
  cannot track data manipulation activities, potentially missing critical security
  incidents and failing compliance requirements. Enabling this logging is essential
  for data governance, forensic analysis, and meeting regulatory standards that require
  comprehensive audit trails of data access and modification.
