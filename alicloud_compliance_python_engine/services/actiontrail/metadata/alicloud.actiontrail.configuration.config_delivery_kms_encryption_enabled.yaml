service: actiontrail
resource: configuration
requirement: Config Delivery KMS Encryption Enabled
scope: actiontrail.configuration.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AliCloud ActionTrail Configuration Delivery Channel Has KMS Encryption
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures ActionTrail configuration has config delivery kms encryption enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail configuration delivery channels are
  encrypted using Key Management Service (KMS) to protect audit log data in transit
  and at rest. Without KMS encryption, sensitive configuration and API activity data
  may be exposed to unauthorized access, potentially compromising compliance with
  data protection regulations and security standards. Enabling KMS encryption ensures
  that audit trails maintain confidentiality and integrity throughout the delivery
  process.
