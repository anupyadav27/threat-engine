title: Data Management Service replication instance should have source logging enabled
  with 90-day retention
rationale: Ensures DMS replication_instance has source logging enabled 90 day retention
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DMS replication instances have source logging enabled with
  a minimum 90-day retention period for comprehensive audit trails. Without adequate
  logging retention, organizations cannot effectively investigate security incidents,
  track data replication activities, or meet compliance requirements for data governance
  and regulatory auditing.
