  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Data Management Service (DMS) data classification classifiers
  are sourced from trusted and verified origins to prevent data misclassification
  and unauthorized access. Untrusted classifier sources can lead to incorrect data
  sensitivity labeling, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing compliance
  violations. This control is essential for maintaining data governance standards
  and regulatory compliance in cloud environments.
