domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Data Management Service (DMS) Data Masking Execution Roles Should Follow Least
  Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures DMS data_masking has masking execution roles least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that DMS data masking execution roles are configured with minimal
  necessary permissions to perform masking operations. Overprivileged roles can lead
  to unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and compliance violations
  with data protection regulations. Implementing least privilege access controls reduces
  the attack surface and limits potential damage from compromised credentials.
