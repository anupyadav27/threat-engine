service: dms
resource: instance
requirement: Multi Az Deployment
scope: dms.instance.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Data Management Service instances should be deployed across multiple availability
  zones
rationale: Ensures DMS instance has multi az deployment properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Data Management Service instances deployed in a single availability zone
  create a single point of failure that can lead to service disruption and data unavailability
  during zone-level outages. Multi-AZ deployment ensures high availability and disaster
  recovery capabilities, which are essential for maintaining business continuity and
  meeting compliance requirements for data accessibility and resilience.
