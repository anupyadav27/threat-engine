subcategory: private_connectivity
severity: medium
title: Ensure Global Traffic Manager Traffic Policy Documents Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Ensures GTM traffic_manager_policy has traffic policy policy documents
  encrypted and private properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Global Traffic Manager traffic policy documents
  are properly encrypted and configured with private access controls. Unencrypted
  or publicly accessible policy documents can expose sensitive routing configurations,
  DNS resolution patterns, and infrastructure topology to unauthorized parties. This
  security gap may lead to compliance violations and potential attack vectors against
  your global traffic distribution strategy.
