title: Ensure AliCloud API Gateway Stage Has Throttling Enabled
rationale: Ensures API stage has throttling enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that throttling is enabled for API Gateway stages
  to prevent API abuse and ensure service availability. Without proper throttling
  controls, APIs are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, resource exhaustion,
  and unexpected cost increases. Enabling throttling helps maintain compliance with
  availability and security requirements by controlling request rates and protecting
  backend services.
