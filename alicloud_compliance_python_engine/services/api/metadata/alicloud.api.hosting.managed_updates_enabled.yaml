title: Ensure AliCloud API Gateway Managed Updates Are Enabled
rationale: Ensures API hosting has managed updates enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that managed updates are enabled for AliCloud API
  Gateway instances to ensure automatic security patches and system updates are applied.
  Without managed updates, API Gateway services may remain vulnerable to known security
  exploits and fail to meet compliance requirements for timely security patching.
  Enabling managed updates helps maintain security posture and reduces operational
  overhead for critical infrastructure components.
