title: Ensure AliCloud API Gateway Functions Are Not Publicly Accessible
rationale: Ensures API function has not publicly accessible properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that API Gateway functions are not configured with
  public access permissions that could expose sensitive functionality to unauthorized
  users. Publicly accessible functions can lead to data breaches, unauthorized code
  execution, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. Proper access
  controls should be implemented to restrict function invocation to authenticated
  and authorized users only.
