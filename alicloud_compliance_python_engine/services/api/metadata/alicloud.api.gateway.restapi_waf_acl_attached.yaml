service: api
resource: gateway
requirement: Restapi Waf ACL Attached
scope: api.gateway.security
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Ensure API Gateway REST APIs have Web Application Firewall ACL attached
rationale: Ensures API gateway has restapi waf acl attached properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that API Gateway REST APIs are protected by Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) Access Control Lists (ACLs). Without WAF protection, APIs are vulnerable
  to common web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks.
  Implementing WAF ACLs helps meet security compliance requirements and provides essential
  application-layer protection for API endpoints.
