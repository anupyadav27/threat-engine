title: AliCloud API Gateway Request Schema Validation Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures API gateway has validation api request schema validation enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.

  validate incoming API requests against predefined schemas. Without proper schema
  validation, APIs are vulnerable to malformed requests, injection attacks, and data
  integrity issues that can compromise application security and compliance with data
  protection standards.
