subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Auto Scaling Group instances should not have public IP addresses assigned
rationale: Ensures AUTO scaling_group has instance group no public ip assigned properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that instances within Auto Scaling Groups are not automatically
  assigned public IP addresses to reduce attack surface and prevent direct internet
  exposure. This configuration helps maintain network security by forcing traffic
  through controlled access points like load balancers or NAT gateways, supporting
  compliance with security frameworks that require private network architectures.
