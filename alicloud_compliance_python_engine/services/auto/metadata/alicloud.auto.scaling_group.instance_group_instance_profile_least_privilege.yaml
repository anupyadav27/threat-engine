subcategory: least_privilege
severity: high
title: Auto Scaling Group Instance Profile Should Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Ensures AUTO scaling_group has instance group instance profile least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Auto Scaling Group instances are configured with RAM roles
  that follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for operation. Overprivileged instance profiles can lead to privilege
  escalation attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive AliCloud resources. This
  control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and reduces the attack
  surface of your infrastructure.
