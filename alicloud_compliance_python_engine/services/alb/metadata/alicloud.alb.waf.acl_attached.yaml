title: Application Load Balancer Web Application Firewall ACL Attachment
rationale: Ensures ALB waf has acl attached properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Load Balancer instances have Web Application
  Firewall Access Control Lists (ACLs) properly attached to provide protection against
  common web attacks and unauthorized access. Missing WAF ACL attachments leave applications
  vulnerable to SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top 10 threats,
  potentially resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
