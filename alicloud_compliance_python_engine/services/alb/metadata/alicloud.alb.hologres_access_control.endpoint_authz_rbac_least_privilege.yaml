title: Application Load Balancer Hologres Access Control Should Implement Endpoint
  Authorization RBAC with Least Privilege Principles
rationale: Ensures ALB hologres_access_control has endpoint authz rbac least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Load Balancer configurations for Hologres database
  access implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege principles
  for endpoint authorization. Improper access controls can lead to unauthorized data
  access, privilege escalation, and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
  This control helps maintain secure database connectivity through load balancer endpoints.
