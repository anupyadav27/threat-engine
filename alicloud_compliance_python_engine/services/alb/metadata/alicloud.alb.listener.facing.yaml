title: Application Load Balancer listener should not be internet-facing when handling
  sensitive traffic
rationale: Ensures ALB listener has facing properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: Internet-facing Application Load Balancer listeners expose applications
  directly to public internet traffic, increasing attack surface and potential security
  risks. Internal-facing listeners should be used for applications that only need
  to serve internal traffic to reduce exposure to external threats and maintain compliance
  with security frameworks that require network segmentation.
