resource: hologres_endpoint
requirement: Endpoint Access Private Only
scope: alb.hologres_endpoint.private_networking
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: private_connectivity
severity: medium
title: Application Load Balancer Hologres endpoints should be configured for private
  access only
rationale: Ensures ALB hologres_endpoint has endpoint access private only properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Application Load Balancer Hologres endpoints are
  configured to allow private access only, preventing unauthorized external access
  to sensitive data warehouse services. Public endpoint exposure can lead to data
  breaches, unauthorized data access, and compliance violations with data protection
  regulations. Restricting endpoint access to private networks significantly reduces
  the attack surface and ensures secure data transmission.
