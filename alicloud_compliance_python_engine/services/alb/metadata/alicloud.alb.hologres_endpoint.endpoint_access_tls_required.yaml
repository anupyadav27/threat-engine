title: Application Load Balancer Hologres Endpoint Must Require TLS Encryption
rationale: Ensures ALB hologres_endpoint has endpoint access tls required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Application Load Balancer endpoints connecting to Hologres

  expose sensitive data warehouse queries and results to potential interception and
  compromise. This requirement is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and
  meeting compliance standards for data protection.
