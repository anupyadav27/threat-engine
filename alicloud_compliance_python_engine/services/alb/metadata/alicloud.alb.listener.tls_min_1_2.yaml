rule_id: alicloud.alb.listener.tls_min_1_2
service: alb
resource: listener
requirement: TLS Min 1 2
scope: alb.listener.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_in_transit
severity: medium
title: Application Load Balancer listeners should enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher
rationale: Ensures ALB listener has tls min 1 2 properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Application Load Balancer listeners are configured
  to use TLS version 1.2 or higher to protect data in transit. Using outdated TLS
  versions (1.0 or 1.1) exposes applications to known cryptographic vulnerabilities
  and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS. Enforcing modern TLS versions
  helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures secure communication between
  clients and backend services.
