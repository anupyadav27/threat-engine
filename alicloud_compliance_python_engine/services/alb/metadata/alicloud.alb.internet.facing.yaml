severity: low
title: Application Load Balancer Should Not Be Internet-Facing Unless Required
rationale: Ensures ALB internet has facing properly configured for security compliance.
  This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Application Load Balancers that are configured with
  internet-facing schemes, which expose them directly to public internet traffic.
  Internet-facing ALBs increase attack surface and potential security risks including
  DDoS attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and data exposure. Organizations should
  use internal load balancers when possible and ensure proper security controls are
  implemented for internet-facing deployments to maintain compliance with security
  frameworks.
