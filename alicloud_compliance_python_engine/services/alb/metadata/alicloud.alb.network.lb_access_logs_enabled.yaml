service: alb
resource: network
requirement: Lb Access Logs Enabled
scope: alb.network.security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Application Load Balancer Access Logs Should Be Enabled
rationale: Ensures ALB network has lb access logs enabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Application Load Balancer instances should have access logging enabled
  to maintain comprehensive audit trails of all incoming requests. Without access
  logs, organizations cannot effectively monitor traffic patterns, investigate security
  incidents, or meet compliance requirements for data access tracking. This creates
  significant gaps in security monitoring and forensic capabilities.
