  regulatory requirements.
description: Application Load Balancers deployed in a single availability zone create
  a single point of failure that can result in service outages and violate high availability
  requirements. Multi-AZ deployment ensures fault tolerance and maintains service
  continuity during zone-level failures. This configuration is essential for meeting
  business continuity and disaster recovery compliance standards.
