title: Express Connect VPN IKE Phase 1 Should Use Strong Encryption Algorithms
rationale: Ensures EXPRESSCONNECT connect has vpn ike phase encryption strong properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Express Connect VPN connections use strong encryption algorithms
  in IKE Phase 1 negotiations to protect IPsec tunnel establishment. Weak encryption
  algorithms like DES or 3DES can be compromised through cryptographic attacks, potentially
  exposing sensitive data transmission and violating security compliance requirements.
  Strong encryption algorithms such as AES-256 are essential for maintaining data
  confidentiality and meeting industry security standards.
