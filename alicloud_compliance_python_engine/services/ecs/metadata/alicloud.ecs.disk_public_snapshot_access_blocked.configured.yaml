title: Elastic Compute Service disk snapshots should block public access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk_public_snapshot_access_blocked has
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) disk snapshots are not publicly
