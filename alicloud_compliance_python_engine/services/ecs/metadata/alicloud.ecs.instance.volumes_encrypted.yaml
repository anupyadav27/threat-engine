title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Instance Volumes Are Encrypted
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has volumes encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all ECS instance volumes have encryption enabled
  to protect data at rest. Unencrypted volumes expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  access in case of physical media compromise or insider threats. Enabling volume
  encryption is essential for meeting compliance requirements such as PCI DSS, HIPAA,
  and other data protection regulations.
