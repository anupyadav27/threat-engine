domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Load Balancer has access logging enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service load_balancer has logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that access logging is enabled for ECS Load Balancer
  instances to capture detailed request information including client IP addresses,
  request paths, and response codes. Without proper logging enabled, organizations
  cannot effectively monitor traffic patterns, detect security incidents, or meet
  compliance requirements for audit trails. Enabling access logs is essential for
  security monitoring, troubleshooting, and forensic analysis of potential attacks
  or unauthorized access attempts.
