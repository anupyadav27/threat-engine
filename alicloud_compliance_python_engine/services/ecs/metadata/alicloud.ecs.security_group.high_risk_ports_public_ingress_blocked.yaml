severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block High Risk Ports from Public
  Internet Access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has high risk ports public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow inbound
  traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) on high-risk ports such as SSH (22), RDP (3389),
  Telnet (23), FTP (21), and database ports. Exposing these ports publicly increases
  the attack surface and creates potential entry points for unauthorized access, data
  breaches, and compliance violations.
