title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To Oracle Database TCP Ports 1521 and 2483
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port oracle 1521 2483 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to Oracle database ports
  1521 (default listener) and 2483 (SSL/TLS listener). Exposing Oracle database ports
  directly to the internet creates significant security risks including unauthorized
  data access, SQL injection attacks, and potential data breaches that may violate
  compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
