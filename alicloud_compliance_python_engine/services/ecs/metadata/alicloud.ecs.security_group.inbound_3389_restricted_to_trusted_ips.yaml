requirement: Inbound 3389 Restricted To Trusted Ips

subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Restrict Inbound RDP Access
  on Port 3389 to Trusted IP Addresses
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has inbound 3389 restricted
  to trusted ips properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access on port 3389 (RDP) from any source IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted
  RDP access significantly increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized remote
  access, brute force attacks, and potential data breaches. This control is essential
  for maintaining compliance with security frameworks and protecting Windows-based
  ECS instances from external threats.
