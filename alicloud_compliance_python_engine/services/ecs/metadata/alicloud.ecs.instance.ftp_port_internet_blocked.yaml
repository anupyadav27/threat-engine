subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block FTP port access from the internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has ftp port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances do not allow inbound
  FTP traffic (port 21) from the internet through security group rules. Exposing FTP
  ports to the internet creates significant security risks including data breaches,
  unauthorized access, and compliance violations due to FTP's unencrypted nature and
  known vulnerabilities. This control helps maintain secure network boundaries and
  reduces attack surface area.
