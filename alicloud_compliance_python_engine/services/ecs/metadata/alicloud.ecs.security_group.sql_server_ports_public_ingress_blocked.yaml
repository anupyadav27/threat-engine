severity: high
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Block Public Ingress Access
  to SQL Server Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has sql server ports public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public access (0.0.0.0/0) to SQL Server ports (1433, 1434). Exposing SQL Server
  ports to the internet significantly increases the risk of unauthorized database
  access, data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
