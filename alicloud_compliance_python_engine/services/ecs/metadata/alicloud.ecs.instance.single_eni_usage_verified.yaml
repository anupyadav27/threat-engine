title: Elastic Compute Service instances should use single ENI configuration for network
  security verification
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has single eni usage verified
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances are configured
  with a single Elastic Network Interface (ENI) to maintain proper network security
  boundaries and simplify traffic monitoring. Multiple ENIs can create complex network
  paths that may bypass security controls and complicate compliance auditing. Single
  ENI usage helps maintain clear network segmentation and reduces the attack surface
  for potential lateral movement.
