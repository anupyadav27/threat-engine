title: Elastic Compute Service Task Definitions Should Enable Logging Block Mode
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service task has definitions logging block mode
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS task definitions have logging block mode properly
  configured to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive log data. Without proper
  logging block mode configuration, task logs may be exposed to unauthorized users,
  potentially leading to data leakage and compliance violations. Proper logging configuration
  is essential for maintaining audit trails and meeting security compliance requirements.
