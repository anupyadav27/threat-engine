service: ecs
resource: snapshot
requirement: Encryption At Rest Enabled
scope: ecs.snapshot.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service snapshots should have encryption at rest enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service snapshot has encryption at rest enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS snapshots are encrypted at rest to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access. Unencrypted snapshots expose data to potential
  security breaches and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
  Enabling encryption at rest provides an additional layer of security for backup
  data stored in AliCloud.
