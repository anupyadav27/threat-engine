title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To TCP Port 22
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port 22 properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies ECS security groups that allow unrestricted SSH
  access (TCP port 22) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Exposing SSH services to the
  entire internet significantly increases the risk of brute force attacks, unauthorized
  access, and potential system compromise. This configuration violates security best
  practices and may impact compliance with security frameworks that require restricted
  administrative access.
