title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block RDP port 3389 from internet
  access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has rdp port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances do not
  allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access on port 3389 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
  Exposing RDP to the internet significantly increases the attack surface and risk
  of brute force attacks, unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. Restricting
  RDP access helps maintain compliance with security frameworks and reduces the likelihood
  of successful remote exploitation attempts.
