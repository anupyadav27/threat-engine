title: Elastic Compute Service Launch Templates Must Require Instance Metadata Service
  Version 2 (IMDSv2)
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch has template imdsv2 required properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ECS launch templates are configured to require IMDSv2, which
  provides enhanced security through session-oriented requests and cryptographic protection.
  IMDSv1 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks that can lead
  to credential theft and unauthorized access to instance metadata. Enforcing IMDSv2
  helps meet security compliance requirements and protects against metadata service
  exploitation.
