subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Network ACL DNS Query Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has dns query logging enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: DNS query logging should be enabled for Network ACLs to monitor and audit
  DNS resolution requests within your VPC network. Without DNS query logging, security
  teams cannot detect malicious domain lookups, data exfiltration attempts, or compliance
  violations that may indicate compromised instances or insider threats. This monitoring
  capability is essential for meeting security compliance requirements and maintaining
  network visibility.
