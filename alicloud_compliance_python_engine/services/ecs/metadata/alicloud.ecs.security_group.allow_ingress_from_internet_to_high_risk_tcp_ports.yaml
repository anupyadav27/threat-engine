title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To High Risk TCP Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to high risk tcp ports properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  inbound traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to high-risk TCP ports such as SSH
  (22), RDP (3389), database ports, and other sensitive services. Exposing these ports
  to the internet significantly increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized
  access, brute force attacks, and potential data breaches. This configuration violates
  security best practices and may impact compliance with data protection regulations.
