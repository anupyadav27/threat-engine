title: Elastic Compute Service Launch Template Should Have Public IP Assignment Disabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch_template has public ip assignment
  disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ECS launch templates are configured to disable automatic
  public IP assignment for instances. Enabling public IP assignment by default increases
  the attack surface by exposing instances directly to the internet, potentially violating
  network security policies and compliance requirements that mandate private network
  architectures.
