rule_id: alicloud.ecs.compute_service.vm_no_public_ip_assigned
service: ecs
resource: compute_service
requirement: Vm No Public Ip Assigned
scope: ecs.compute_service.public_access
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should not have public IP addresses assigned
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm no public ip assigned
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances do not have public IP addresses
  directly assigned, reducing the attack surface and preventing direct internet exposure.
  Instances with public IPs are vulnerable to internet-based attacks and may violate
  compliance requirements for network isolation. Use NAT gateways or load balancers
  for controlled internet access instead.
