title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Restrict SSH Access to Approved
  IP Addresses
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has ssh access restricted
  to whitelist properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not
  allow unrestricted SSH access (port 22) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Unrestricted
  SSH access significantly increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access,
  brute force attacks, and potential data breaches. Implementing IP whitelisting for
  SSH access is essential for maintaining compliance with security frameworks and
  protecting critical infrastructure.
