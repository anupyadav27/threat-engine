title: Ensure Unattached Elastic Compute Service Disks Are Encrypted With Customer
  Master Keys
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ensure has unattached disks encrypted with
  cmk properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Verifies that all unattached ECS disks are encrypted using Customer Master
  Keys (CMK) rather than service-managed keys. Unencrypted or inadequately encrypted
  storage volumes pose significant data breach risks and may violate compliance requirements
  such as PCI DSS and GDPR. CMK encryption provides enhanced security control and
  audit capabilities for sensitive data protection.
