title: Elastic Compute Service launch templates must not contain hardcoded secrets
  or credentials
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service launch has template no secrets properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Launch templates should not contain hardcoded secrets, passwords, API
  keys, or other sensitive credentials in user data or metadata fields. Embedded secrets
  in launch templates pose significant security risks as they can be exposed to unauthorized
  users and may violate compliance requirements for data protection and access control.
