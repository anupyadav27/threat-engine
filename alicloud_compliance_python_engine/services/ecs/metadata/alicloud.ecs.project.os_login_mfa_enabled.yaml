rule_id: alicloud.ecs.project.os_login_mfa_enabled
service: ecs
resource: project
requirement: Os Login MFA Enabled
scope: ecs.project.authentication
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: multi_factor_authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service OS Login Multi-Factor Authentication is Enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service project has os login mfa enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
  for OS Login on Elastic Compute Service instances. Without MFA, user authentication
  relies solely on passwords or SSH keys, creating significant security vulnerabilities
  including unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling MFA adds an
  essential security layer that helps meet compliance requirements for access control
  and identity management.
