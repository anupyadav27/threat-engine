title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Do Not Allow Unrestricted Internet
  Access and Web Application Firewall ACLs Are Properly Configured
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to all ports, alicloud api gateway restapi waf acl attached, alicloud alb waf acl
  attached properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule validates that ECS security groups do not permit ingress traffic
  from the internet to all ports, which creates significant security vulnerabilities
  and potential attack vectors. Additionally, it ensures that API Gateway REST APIs
  and Application Load Balancers have Web Application Firewall ACLs properly attached
  to provide essential protection against common web exploits and maintain compliance
  with security frameworks.
