severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service Task Definitions Should Have Logging Enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service task has definitions logging enabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: ECS task definitions must have logging configured to capture container
  runtime events and application logs. Without proper logging, security incidents
  cannot be effectively investigated, compliance requirements may be violated, and
  operational troubleshooting becomes significantly more difficult. This creates blind
  spots in security monitoring and audit trails.
