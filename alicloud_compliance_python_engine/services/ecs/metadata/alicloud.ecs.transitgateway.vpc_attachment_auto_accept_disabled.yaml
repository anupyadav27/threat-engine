title: Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service Transit Gateway VPC Attachment Auto Accept
  Should Be Disabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service transitgateway has vpc attachment auto
  accept disabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Transit Gateway VPC attachments do not automatically accept
  connection requests without proper authorization. Enabling auto-accept bypasses
  security controls and allows unauthorized VPC connections, potentially exposing
  sensitive resources to unintended network access. This configuration violates network
  segmentation principles and can lead to compliance violations in regulated environments.
