severity: low
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Elastic IP addresses are not unassigned
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service elastic has ip unassigned properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Unassigned Elastic IP addresses in Elastic Compute Service create unnecessary
  security exposure and incur ongoing costs without providing value. These orphaned
  IP addresses can be inadvertently reassigned to unauthorized resources or remain
  as potential attack vectors, violating cost optimization and security compliance
  requirements.
