title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service volumes are actively in use
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service volume has in use properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies unused Elastic Compute Service (ECS) volumes that
  are not attached to any instances. Unused volumes pose security risks through unnecessary
  data exposure, potential unauthorized access to stored data, and increased attack
  surface. Additionally, unused volumes may violate compliance requirements for data
  lifecycle management and cost optimization policies.
