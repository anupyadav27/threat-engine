title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block RDS SQL Server port access from
  internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has rds sqlserver port internet
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances have security group rules
  that block direct internet access to RDS SQL Server default port (1433). Exposing
  database ports directly to the internet increases the risk of unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and compliance violations with data protection regulations.
