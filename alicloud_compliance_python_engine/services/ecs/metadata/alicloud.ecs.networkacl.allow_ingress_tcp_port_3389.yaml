title: Elastic Compute Service Network ACL Should Restrict Ingress TCP Port 3389 Access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has allow ingress tcp port 3389
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Network ACLs that allow unrestricted ingress access
  on TCP port 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol). Allowing broad access to RDP can expose
  Windows instances to brute force attacks and unauthorized remote access attempts.
  Restricting RDP access to specific IP ranges helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks and reduces the attack surface for critical infrastructure.
