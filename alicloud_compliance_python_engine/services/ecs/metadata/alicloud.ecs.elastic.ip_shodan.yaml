rule_id: alicloud.ecs.elastic.ip_shodan
service: ecs
resource: elastic
requirement: Ip Shodan
scope: ecs.elastic.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service Elastic IP addresses should not be exposed in Shodan
  search engine
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service elastic has ip shodan properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service (ECS) Elastic IP addresses
  that are indexed and publicly discoverable through the Shodan search engine. Exposure
  in Shodan indicates that services running on these IPs are publicly accessible and
  may reveal sensitive information about your infrastructure to potential attackers.
  This visibility increases the attack surface and can lead to targeted attacks, compliance
  violations, and unauthorized reconnaissance of your cloud resources.
