rule_id: alicloud.ecs.compute_service.vm_imds_hardened
service: ecs
resource: compute_service
requirement: Vm Imds Hardened
scope: ecs.compute_service.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances have hardened Instance Metadata Service
  configuration
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm imds hardened properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS instances have properly configured Instance
  Metadata Service (IMDS) security settings to prevent unauthorized access to instance
  metadata. Unsecured IMDS endpoints can expose sensitive information including temporary
  credentials, instance details, and user data, potentially leading to privilege escalation
  and data breaches. Proper IMDS hardening is essential for maintaining compliance
  with security frameworks and protecting against SSRF attacks.
