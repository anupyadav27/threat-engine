title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances block public access to Telnet port
  23
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has telnet port public access
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow
  public internet access to port 23 (Telnet). Telnet transmits data in plain text
  including credentials, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Blocking public Telnet access helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
  and prevents unauthorized remote access to instances.
