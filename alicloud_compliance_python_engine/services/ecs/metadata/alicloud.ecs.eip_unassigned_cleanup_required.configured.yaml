title: Elastic Compute Service Unassigned Elastic IP Address Cleanup Configuration
  Required
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service eip_unassigned_cleanup_required has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that unassigned Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) in Elastic Compute
  Service are properly configured for cleanup to prevent unnecessary costs and reduce
  attack surface. Unassigned EIPs can lead to billing waste and potential security
  risks if not properly managed, as they may be inadvertently exposed or misconfigured.
  This control helps maintain cost optimization and security compliance by ensuring
  proper EIP lifecycle management.
