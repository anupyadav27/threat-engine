resource: transitgateway
requirement: Auto Accept VPC Attachments
scope: ecs.transitgateway.security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Alibaba Cloud Express Connect Transit Gateway should disable auto-accept VPC
  attachments
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service transitgateway has auto accept vpc attachments
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Express Connect Transit Gateway instances with auto-accept VPC attachments
  enabled automatically accept all VPC attachment requests without manual approval,
  potentially allowing unauthorized network access. This configuration bypasses security
  controls and can lead to unintended network connectivity, increasing the risk of
  lateral movement and data exposure across VPC boundaries.
