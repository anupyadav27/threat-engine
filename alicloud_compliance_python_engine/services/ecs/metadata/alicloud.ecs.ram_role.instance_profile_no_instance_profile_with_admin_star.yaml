resource: ram_role
requirement: Instance Profile No Instance Profile With Admin Star
scope: ecs.ram_role.security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service Instance Profiles Should Not Have Administrative Wildcard
  Permissions
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ram_role has instance profile no instance
  profile with admin star properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ECS instance profiles do not have RAM roles with administrative
  wildcard (*) permissions attached. Instance profiles with overly broad permissions
  violate the principle of least privilege and can lead to privilege escalation attacks
  if the instance is compromised. This configuration increases the blast radius of
  potential security incidents and may violate compliance frameworks requiring granular
  access controls.
