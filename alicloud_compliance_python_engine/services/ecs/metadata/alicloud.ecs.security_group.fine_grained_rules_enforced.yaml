title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Enforce Fine-Grained Access
  Rules
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has fine grained rules enforced
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Security groups with overly permissive rules (such as 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0
  for all ports) create significant security vulnerabilities by allowing unrestricted
  network access to ECS instances. Fine-grained rules that specify exact source IPs,
  port ranges, and protocols are essential for maintaining network segmentation and
  reducing attack surface. This configuration helps meet compliance requirements for
  network access controls and prevents unauthorized access to critical resources.
