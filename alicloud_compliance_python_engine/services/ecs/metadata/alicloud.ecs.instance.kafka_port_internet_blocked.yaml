severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block Kafka port access from internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has kafka port internet blocked
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not allow inbound traffic
  on Kafka ports (9092, 9093) from the internet through security group rules. Exposing
  Kafka ports to the internet can lead to unauthorized data access, message interception,
  and potential data breaches, violating data protection compliance requirements.
