subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service vulnerability scanning is scheduled and configured
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service vulnerability_scan_scheduled has configured
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that vulnerability scanning is properly scheduled
  and configured for ECS instances to detect security weaknesses and potential threats.
  Without regular vulnerability scanning, instances may remain exposed to known security
  flaws, increasing the risk of exploitation and compromising compliance with security
  frameworks. Automated vulnerability scanning helps maintain a proactive security
  posture by identifying and addressing security gaps before they can be exploited.
