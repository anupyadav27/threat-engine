title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To TCP Port 9092 (Kafka)
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port kafka 9092 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 9092, commonly
  used by Apache Kafka. Exposing Kafka brokers directly to the internet creates significant
  security risks including unauthorized data access, message interception, and potential
  data breaches. This configuration violates security best practices and may impact
  compliance with data protection regulations.
