title: Elastic Compute Service instances should block Elasticsearch Kibana port access
  from internet
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has elasticsearch kibana port
  internet blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service instances do not expose Elasticsearch
  Kibana ports (typically 5601) to internet traffic through security group rules.
  Unrestricted access to Kibana interfaces can lead to unauthorized data access, system
  compromise, and compliance violations with data protection regulations. This control
  helps maintain secure network boundaries and prevents potential data breaches through
  exposed management interfaces.
