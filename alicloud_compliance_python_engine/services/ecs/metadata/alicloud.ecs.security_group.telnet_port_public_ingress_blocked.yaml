title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  on Telnet Port 23
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has telnet port public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access on port 23 (Telnet) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Telnet transmits
  data in plain text including passwords, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and
  man-in-the-middle attacks. Blocking public Telnet access helps maintain compliance
  with security frameworks and reduces the attack surface of ECS instances.
