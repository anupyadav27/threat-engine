title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service instances have Security Center Agent installed
  and active
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has security center agent installed
  and active properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Verifies that AliCloud Security Center Agent is properly installed and
  running on ECS instances to enable real-time threat detection and security monitoring.
  Instances without active Security Center Agent lack essential security capabilities
  including malware detection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance monitoring.
  This creates significant security gaps and may violate regulatory compliance requirements
  for continuous security monitoring.
