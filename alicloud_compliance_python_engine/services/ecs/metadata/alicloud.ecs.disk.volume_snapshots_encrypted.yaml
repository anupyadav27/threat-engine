title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service disk volume snapshots are encrypted
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service disk has volume snapshots encrypted properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that ECS disk volume snapshots are encrypted to protect
  data at rest. Unencrypted snapshots expose sensitive data to unauthorized access
  and may violate compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Encryption ensures
  that snapshot data remains protected even if storage media is compromised.
