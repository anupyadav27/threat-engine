title: Ensure Elastic Compute Service Client VPN Endpoint Connection Logging is Enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service client has vpn endpoint connection logging
  enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that connection logging is enabled for Client VPN
  endpoints in Elastic Compute Service. Without proper logging, organizations cannot
  monitor VPN access patterns, detect unauthorized connections, or maintain audit
  trails required for security incident response and compliance frameworks. Enabling
  connection logging is essential for tracking user activities and identifying potential
  security breaches in VPN infrastructure.
