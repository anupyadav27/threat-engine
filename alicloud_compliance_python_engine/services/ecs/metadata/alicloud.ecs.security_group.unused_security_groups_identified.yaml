requirement: Unused Security Groups Identified
scope: ecs.security_group.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: security_group_management
severity: medium
title: Identify Unused Elastic Compute Service Security Groups
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has unused security groups
  identified properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Detects security groups that are not associated with any ECS instances
  or other resources, creating unnecessary attack surface and compliance violations.
  Unused security groups can contain overly permissive rules that pose security risks
  and make it difficult to maintain proper network access controls. Regular identification
  and removal of unused security groups helps maintain security hygiene and reduces
  potential misconfigurations.
