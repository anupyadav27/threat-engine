title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  to Kafka Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has kafka port public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public ingress access to Kafka ports (9092, 9093). Exposing Kafka brokers to the
  internet can lead to unauthorized data access, message interception, and potential
  data breaches. This control helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations
  and prevents unauthorized access to streaming data infrastructure.
