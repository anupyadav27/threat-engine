title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block Public Ingress Access
  to Oracle Database Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has oracle ports public
  ingress blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  public ingress access to Oracle database ports (1521, 2483, 2484). Exposing Oracle
  database ports to the internet creates significant security risks including unauthorized
  data access, database compromise, and potential data breaches. This control helps
  maintain compliance with data protection regulations and database security best
  practices.
