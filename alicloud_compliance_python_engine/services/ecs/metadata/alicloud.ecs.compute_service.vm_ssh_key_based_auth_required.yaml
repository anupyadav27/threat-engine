title: Elastic Compute Service instances must use SSH key-based authentication instead
  of password authentication
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service compute_service has vm ssh key based auth
  required properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances are configured to use SSH key-based
  authentication rather than password-based authentication for secure access. Password-based
  authentication is vulnerable to brute force attacks and credential theft, while
  SSH keys provide stronger cryptographic security. Implementing key-based authentication
  helps meet compliance requirements for secure remote access and reduces the risk
  of unauthorized instance access.
