service: ecs
resource: e_hpc_ai
requirement: Network Isolation Enabled
scope: ecs.e_hpc_ai.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Elastic High Performance Computing AI Instances Should Have Network Isolation
  Enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service e_hpc_ai has network isolation enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic High Performance Computing (E-HPC) AI instances
  have network isolation properly configured to prevent unauthorized network access
  and lateral movement attacks. Network isolation helps maintain compliance with data
  protection regulations and reduces the attack surface by restricting network communications
  to authorized channels only.
