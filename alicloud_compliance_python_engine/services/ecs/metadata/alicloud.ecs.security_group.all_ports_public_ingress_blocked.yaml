severity: high
title: Elastic Compute Service Security Groups Should Block All Ports from Public
  Internet Access
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has all ports public ingress
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that Elastic Compute Service security groups do not allow unrestricted
  inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) on all ports. Open access to all ports
  significantly increases the attack surface and exposes instances to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and compliance violations. This control helps maintain network
  segmentation and follows the principle of least privilege access.
