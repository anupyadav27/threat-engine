subcategory: security_monitoring

title: Ensure Elastic Block Storage Volumes Are Protected By Backup Plan
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ebs has volume protected by backup plan
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes have backup
  protection enabled through AliCloud's backup service. Unprotected volumes pose significant
  data loss risks during system failures, security incidents, or accidental deletions,
  potentially leading to compliance violations and business continuity disruptions.
  Regular automated backups are essential for maintaining data integrity and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
