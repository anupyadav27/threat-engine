title: Elastic Compute Service Security Group Should Not Allow Ingress From Internet
  To TCP Port Redis 6379
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service security_group has allow ingress from internet
  to tcp port redis 6379 properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies Elastic Compute Service security groups that allow
  unrestricted inbound access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to TCP port 6379, commonly
  used by Redis databases. Exposing Redis instances directly to the internet creates
  significant security risks including unauthorized data access, data breaches, and
  potential compliance violations with data protection regulations.
