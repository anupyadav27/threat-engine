title: Elastic Compute Service instances should not remain in stopped state for extended
  periods
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service stopped has instance properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Stopped ECS instances may contain sensitive data in memory dumps, temporary
  files, or unencrypted storage that could be accessed if the underlying infrastructure
  is compromised. Extended stopped states can also lead to compliance violations regarding
  asset management and increase security risks from unpatched systems that may restart
  unexpectedly.
