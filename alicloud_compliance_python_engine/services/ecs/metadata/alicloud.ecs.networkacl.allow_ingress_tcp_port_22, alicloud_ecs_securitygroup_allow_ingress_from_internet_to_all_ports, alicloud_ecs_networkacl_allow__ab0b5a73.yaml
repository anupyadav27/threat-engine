service: ecs
resource: networkacl
requirement: Allow Ingress Tcp Port 22, Alicloud ECS Securitygroup Allow Ingress From
  Internet To All Ports, Alicloud ECS Networkacl Allow Ingress Tcp Port 3389, Alicloud
  Pai Notebook Instance Without Direct Internet Access Configured

severity: medium
title: Elastic Compute Service Network ACL and Security Group Ingress Controls for
  Critical Ports
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service networkacl has allow ingress tcp port 22,
  alicloud ecs securitygroup allow ingress from internet to all ports, alicloud ecs
  networkacl allow ingress tcp port 3389, alicloud pai notebook instance without direct
  internet access configured properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Validates that Elastic Compute Service instances have proper network
  access controls configured for high-risk ports including SSH (22) and RDP (3389),
  and ensures security groups don't allow unrestricted internet access to all ports.
  Misconfigured ingress rules can expose instances to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and compliance violations with security frameworks requiring network segmentation.
