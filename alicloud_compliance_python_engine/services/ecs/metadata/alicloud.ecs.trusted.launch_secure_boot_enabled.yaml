  Secure Boot enabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service trusted has launch secure boot enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances have Secure Boot enabled as part
  of Trusted Launch features to protect against boot-level malware and unauthorized
  operating system modifications. Secure Boot validates the digital signature of boot
  components, preventing rootkits and bootkits from compromising the system integrity.
  Disabling this feature increases the risk of persistent malware infections and may
  impact compliance with security frameworks requiring boot-level protection.
