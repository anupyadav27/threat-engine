rule_id: alicloud.ecs.instance.password_auth_disabled
service: ecs
resource: instance
requirement: Password Auth Disabled
scope: ecs.instance.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Elastic Compute Service instances should have password authentication disabled
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has password auth disabled properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ECS instances are configured to disable password-based
  authentication in favor of key-based authentication methods. Password authentication
  is vulnerable to brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing,
  which can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Disabling password
  authentication and using SSH key pairs significantly improves instance security
  posture and helps meet compliance requirements for secure access controls.
