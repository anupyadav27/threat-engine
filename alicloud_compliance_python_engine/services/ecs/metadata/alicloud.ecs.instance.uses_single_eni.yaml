title: Elastic Compute Service Instance Should Use Single Elastic Network Interface
rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has uses single eni properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures ECS instances are configured with only one Elastic Network Interface
  (ENI) to reduce network attack surface and simplify security management. Multiple
  ENIs can create complex routing scenarios and increase the risk of network-based
  attacks or misconfigurations. This configuration helps maintain network security
  boundaries and supports compliance with network segmentation requirements.
