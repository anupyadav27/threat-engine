title: AliCloud CloudMonitor Dashboard Public Embeds Should Be Disabled
rationale: Ensures CMS dashboard has public embeds disabled properly configured for
  security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that AliCloud CloudMonitor dashboards have public embedding functionality
  disabled to prevent unauthorized access to monitoring data. Public embeds can expose
  sensitive infrastructure metrics and performance data to unauthorized users, potentially
  revealing system architecture and operational patterns. Disabling public embeds
  maintains data confidentiality and supports compliance with data protection requirements.
