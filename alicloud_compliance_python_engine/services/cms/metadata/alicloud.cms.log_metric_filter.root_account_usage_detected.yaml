title: Alibaba Cloud CloudMonitor Log Metric Filter Should Detect Root Account Usage
rationale: Ensures CMS log_metric_filter has root account usage detected properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that CloudMonitor log metric filters are configured
  to detect and alert on root account usage activities. Root account usage poses significant
  security risks as it provides unrestricted access to all cloud resources and should
  be monitored for compliance with security best practices. Unmonitored root account
  activity can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and compliance violations.
