title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Log Metric Filter Monitors Disable or Scheduled
  Deletion of Key Management Service Customer Master Keys
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter disable or scheduled deletion of kms
  cmk properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service has proper log metric filters
  configured to detect when Key Management Service Customer Master Keys (CMKs) are
  disabled or scheduled for deletion. Without proper monitoring of CMK lifecycle events,
  organizations may miss critical security incidents that could lead to data access
  loss or unauthorized encryption key management. This monitoring is essential for
  maintaining data protection compliance and preventing accidental or malicious key
  deletion that could render encrypted data inaccessible.
