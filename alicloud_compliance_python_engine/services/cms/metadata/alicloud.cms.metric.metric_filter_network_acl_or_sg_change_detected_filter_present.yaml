title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Has Metric Filter for Network ACL and Security
  Group Changes
rationale: Ensures CMS metric has metric filter network acl or sg change detected
  filter present properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor has configured metric filters to
  detect changes to Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Security Groups. Without
  proper monitoring of network security configuration changes, unauthorized modifications
  to network access controls may go undetected, potentially exposing resources to
  security breaches and failing compliance requirements for network change auditing.
