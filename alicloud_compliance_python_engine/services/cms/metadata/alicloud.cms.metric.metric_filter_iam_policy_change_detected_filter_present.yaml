rationale: Ensures CMS metric has metric filter iam policy change detected filter
  present properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.

  may go undetected, potentially compromising compliance with security frameworks
  and exposing sensitive resources to unauthorized access.
