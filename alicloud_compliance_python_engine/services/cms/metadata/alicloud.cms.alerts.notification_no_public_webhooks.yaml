title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Alert Notifications Do Not Use Public Webhooks
rationale: Ensures CMS alerts has notification no public webhooks properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CloudMonitor Service alert notifications are
  not configured to send data to publicly accessible webhook endpoints. Public webhooks
  can expose sensitive monitoring data and alert information to unauthorized parties,
  potentially leading to information disclosure and compliance violations. Restricting
  webhook endpoints to private or authenticated channels helps maintain data confidentiality
  and meets security compliance requirements.
