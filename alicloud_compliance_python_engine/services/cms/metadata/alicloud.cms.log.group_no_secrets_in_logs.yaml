title: CloudMonitor Service Log Groups Should Not Contain Secrets in Log Data
rationale: Ensures CMS log has group no secrets in logs properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that CloudMonitor Service log groups do not contain sensitive
  information such as passwords, API keys, or tokens in log entries. Storing secrets
  in logs creates significant security risks including unauthorized access, compliance
  violations, and potential data breaches when logs are accessed by unauthorized personnel
  or systems.
