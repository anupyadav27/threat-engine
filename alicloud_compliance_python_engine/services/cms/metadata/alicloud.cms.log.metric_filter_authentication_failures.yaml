rule_id: alicloud.cms.log.metric_filter_authentication_failures
service: cms
resource: log
requirement: Metric Filter Authentication Failures
scope: cms.log.authentication
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: high
title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service has metric filters configured for authentication
  failures
rationale: Ensures CMS log has metric filter authentication failures properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Authentication failure events should be monitored through CloudMonitor
  Service metric filters to detect potential brute force attacks, credential stuffing,
  or unauthorized access attempts. Without proper monitoring of authentication failures,
  security incidents may go undetected, leading to compliance violations and potential
  data breaches.
