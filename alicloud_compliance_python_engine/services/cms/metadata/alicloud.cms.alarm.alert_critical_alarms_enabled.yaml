title: Ensure CloudMonitor Service Critical Alarm Notifications Are Enabled
rationale: Ensures CMS alarm has alert critical alarms enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that critical alarms in AliCloud CloudMonitor Service
  have alert notifications properly configured and enabled. Without proper alerting
  for critical alarms, security incidents and system failures may go unnoticed, leading
  to prolonged service disruptions and potential compliance violations. Enabling critical
  alarm notifications ensures timely response to security threats and maintains operational
  visibility required by security frameworks.
