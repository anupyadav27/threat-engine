title: Ensure E-MapReduce cluster monitoring is enabled through CloudMonitor
rationale: Ensures CMS emr_admin has monitoring enabled properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: E-MapReduce clusters must have monitoring enabled to track cluster health,
  performance metrics, and security events. Without proper monitoring, security incidents,
  resource anomalies, and performance degradation may go undetected, leading to potential
  data breaches and compliance violations. This monitoring is essential for maintaining
  operational visibility and meeting security audit requirements.
