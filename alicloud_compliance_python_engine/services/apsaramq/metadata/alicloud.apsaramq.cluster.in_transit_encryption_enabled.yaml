title: ApsaraMQ for Apache Kafka Cluster Should Have In-Transit Encryption Enabled
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ cluster has in transit encryption enabled properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that ApsaraMQ for Apache Kafka clusters have in-transit
  encryption enabled to protect data transmission between clients and brokers. Without
  encryption, sensitive message data transmitted over the network is vulnerable to
  interception and eavesdropping attacks. Enabling in-transit encryption helps meet
  compliance requirements for data protection standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
