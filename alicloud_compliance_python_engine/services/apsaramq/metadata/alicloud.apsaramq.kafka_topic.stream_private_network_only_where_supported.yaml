title: ApsaraMQ for Apache Kafka Topics Should Use Private Network Access Only Where
  Supported
rationale: Ensures APSARAMQ kafka_topic has stream private network only where supported
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: Ensures that ApsaraMQ for Apache Kafka topics are configured to use private
  network access only in regions where this feature is supported. Public network exposure
  of Kafka topics increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized data access
  or message interception. This configuration helps maintain data confidentiality
  and meets compliance requirements for network isolation.
