resource: volume
requirement: Backup Enabled
title: Ensure Persistent Volume Backups Are Configured
description: This rule checks whether persistent volumes in Kubernetes clusters have
  an associated backup process configured. It validates configurations against best
  practices for backup frequency, retention policies, and secure storage of backups.
  Ensuring backups are enabled helps in mitigating risks associated with data loss,
  supports disaster recovery plans, and aids in maintaining compliance with industry
  standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without regular backups, persistent volumes in Kubernetes are vulnerable
  to data loss due to incidents such as hardware failures, accidental deletions, or
  ransomware attacks. Lack of backups can lead to significant business disruptions,
  loss of critical data, and inability to recover quickly from failures, impacting
  both operational continuity and regulatory compliance.
