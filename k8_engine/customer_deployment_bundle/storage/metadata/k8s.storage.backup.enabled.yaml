title: Ensure Persistent Volume Backups Are Enabled and Configured
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes persistent volumes have backup solutions
  enabled and correctly configured according to best practices. It ensures that data
  is regularly backed up and securely stored, reducing the likelihood of data loss
  and facilitating rapid recovery. A good configuration includes automated backup
  schedules, secure storage of backups, and regular restoration tests. This enhances
  data integrity and availability, and helps meet compliance requirements by protecting
  sensitive data.
rationale: Without properly configured backups, data stored in Kubernetes persistent
  volumes is at risk of loss due to accidental deletion, corruption, or attacks such
  as ransomware. Backups are critical for data recovery and continuity, protecting
  against data breaches and ensuring system resilience.
