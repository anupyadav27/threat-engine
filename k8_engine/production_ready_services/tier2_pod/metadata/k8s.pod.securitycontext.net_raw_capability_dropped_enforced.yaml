resource: securitycontext
requirement: Net Raw Capability Dropped Enforced
title: Ensure NET_RAW Capability is Dropped in Pod SecurityContext
description: This control checks that the NET_RAW capability is not present in the
  securityContext of Kubernetes pods. A correctly configured pod will have this capability
  explicitly dropped, which helps to prevent potential misuse of raw sockets. This
  configuration aligns with security best practices by reducing the privileges of
  the container process, thereby adhering to the principle of least privilege.
rationale: Allowing the NET_RAW capability in pods can expose the cluster to potential
  security risks such as packet spoofing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or unauthorized
  network traffic capture. Dropping this capability minimizes the attack surface by
  restricting pods from crafting arbitrary network packets.
