requirement: Psa Enforced
title: Enforce Pod Security Admission Policies
description: This control checks if Pod Security Admission policies are enforced in
  the cluster. PSA provides a mechanism to define and apply security standards at
  the namespace level, ensuring that pods adhere to defined security profiles such
  as 'privileged', 'baseline', or 'restricted'. By enforcing these policies, you can
  prevent the deployment of pods with configurations that pose security risks, such
  as running as root or accessing sensitive host resources. Proper enforcement of
  PSA enhances overall cluster security by reducing the attack surface and aligning
  with industry security standards.
rationale: Failure to enforce Pod Security Admission (PSA) policies can lead to elevated
  security risks, such as privilege escalation, data breaches, and unauthorized access
  to sensitive resources. Without PSA, there is an increased risk of deploying pods
  with insecure configurations that could be exploited by attackers to compromise
  the cluster.
