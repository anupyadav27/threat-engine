service: pod
resource: security
requirement: Host Network Policy Check
title: Restrict Host Network Access for Pods
description: This rule checks that pods are not configured to use the host network
  unless absolutely necessary. A pod using the host network shares the network namespace
  of the host, which can lead to exposure of sensitive internal network traffic and
  increase the attack surface. Properly configured, pods should use their own network
  namespace to limit the potential impact of a compromised pod. This control ensures
  that any exception to this is explicitly justified and documented, enhancing the
  overall security posture of the cluster by reducing unnecessary exposure.
rationale: If a pod is allowed to use the host network, it can potentially listen
  on network interfaces and gain access to network traffic that it shouldn't. This
  can be exploited to intercept traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or scan
  the network for vulnerabilities, posing significant security risks.
