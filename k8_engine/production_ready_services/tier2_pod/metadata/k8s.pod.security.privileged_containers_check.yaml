resource: security
requirement: Privileged Containers Check
title: Prohibit Privileged Containers in Pods
description: 'This control checks that no pods in the Kubernetes cluster are configured
  with privileged containers enabled. Privileged containers have elevated permissions
  that allow them to perform operations typically restricted by the container runtime.
  By ensuring that the ''privileged: true'' setting is not used in pod specifications,
  this control helps maintain an isolated and secure environment, reducing the risk
  of container breakout and unauthorized access to the host system. Proper configuration
  involves setting ''privileged: false'' in the SecurityContext of all pods.'
rationale: Allowing privileged containers in Kubernetes can lead to severe security
  vulnerabilities. Such containers can access the host's resources, potentially leading
  to privilege escalation attacks where malicious actors gain unauthorized access
  to the host system. This can compromise the entire cluster by enabling the attacker
  to bypass namespace isolation and access sensitive data or inject malicious code.
