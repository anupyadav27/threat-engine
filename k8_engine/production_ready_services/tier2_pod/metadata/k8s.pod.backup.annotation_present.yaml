resource: backup
requirement: Annotation Present
title: Ensure Backup Annotation is Present on Pods
description: This control checks for the presence of specific backup-related annotations
  on Kubernetes pods. Properly configured annotations ensure that backup tools can
  accurately identify which pods require backup, how frequently they should be backed
  up, and any specific requirements for the backup process. By validating these annotations,
  organizations can ensure that their data protection strategies are implemented consistently
  across their Kubernetes infrastructure, reducing the risk of data loss and enhancing
  compliance with industry standards.
rationale: The absence of backup annotations on Kubernetes pods can lead to inconsistencies
  in backup operations and the potential loss of critical data. Annotations provide
  essential metadata that can be used by backup tools to identify and manage backup
  operations effectively. Without these annotations, there is a risk of improper backup
  scheduling, resulting in data loss, compliance breaches, and potential exposure
  to security vulnerabilities.
