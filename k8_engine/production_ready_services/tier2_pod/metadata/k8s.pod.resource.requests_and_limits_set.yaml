title: Set Pod Resource Requests and Limits to Prevent Resource Exhaustion
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes pods have resource requests and
  limits defined for CPU and memory. Properly setting these values ensures that each
  pod receives the resources it needs without exceeding what the cluster can provide.
  This not only helps in maintaining application performance but also prevents a single
  pod from monopolizing cluster resources, which can lead to denial of service attacks.
  By adhering to this configuration, you align with security best practices and benchmarks
  like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failing to set resource requests and limits on pods can lead to resource
  exhaustion, impacting cluster availability and performance. Attackers can exploit
  this by deploying pods that consume excessive CPU or memory, causing denial of service
  to other applications.
