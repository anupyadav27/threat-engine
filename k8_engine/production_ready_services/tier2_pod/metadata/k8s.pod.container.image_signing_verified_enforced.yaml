service: pod
resource: container
requirement: Image Signing Verified Enforced
title: Enforce Image Signature Verification for Pod Containers
description: This rule checks if container images used in Kubernetes Pods have their
  signatures verified before deployment. Proper image signature verification ensures
  that only images from trusted sources are executed, reducing the risk of running
  compromised or unauthorized software. A good configuration involves integrating
  admission controllers or custom policies that enforce image signature checks, thus
  enhancing the overall security posture by ensuring image integrity and authenticity.
rationale: Failure to verify container image signatures can lead to the deployment
  of untrusted or malicious images, increasing the risk of unauthorized code execution
  and potential breaches. Attackers could exploit unsigned images to introduce vulnerabilities,
  exploit known security flaws, or execute arbitrary code within the cluster.
