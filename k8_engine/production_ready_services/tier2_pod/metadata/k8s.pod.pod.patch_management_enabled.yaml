title: Ensure Regular Patch Updates for Kubernetes Pods
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes pods are configured to receive
  regular patch updates. A good configuration involves using image tags that correspond
  to specific, updated versions rather than 'latest', and implementing automated processes
  for testing and deploying new patches. By maintaining up-to-date images, vulnerabilities
  are minimized, reducing the risk of exploitation and maintaining compliance with
  security standards.
rationale: Without regular patch updates, Kubernetes pods can be vulnerable to known
  exploits and security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities
  to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or escalate privileges. Ensuring
  patch management guards against such threats by applying security updates promptly.
