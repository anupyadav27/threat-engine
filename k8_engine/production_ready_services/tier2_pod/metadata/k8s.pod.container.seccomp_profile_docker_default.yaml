resource: container
requirement: Seccomp Profile Docker Default
title: Enforce Default Seccomp Profile for Containers
description: This control checks whether each container within a pod is configured
  to use the 'docker/default' seccomp profile. The default seccomp profile provides
  a balanced set of restrictions that limit the container's ability to make potentially
  dangerous system calls, thereby reducing the attack surface. Properly setting the
  seccomp profile helps in adhering to security best practices by limiting system
  call access and preventing exploitation of known kernel vulnerabilities.
rationale: If a container runs without a seccomp profile or with an overly permissive
  one, it increases the risk of system calls being exploited by attackers to escalate
  privileges or perform malicious actions within the host. This could lead to container
  escape, data leakage, or unauthorized access to host resources.
