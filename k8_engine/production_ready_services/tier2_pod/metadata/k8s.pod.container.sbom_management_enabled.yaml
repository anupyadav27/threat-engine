rule_id: k8s.pod.container.sbom_management_enabled
service: pod
resource: container
requirement: Sbom Management Enabled
title: Enable SBOM Management in Pod Containers
description: This rule checks whether SBOM management is enabled for each container
  within a Kubernetes pod. An effective SBOM management ensures that all software
  components and their dependencies are documented, enabling security teams to identify
  and remediate vulnerabilities promptly. Proper configuration includes the automatic
  generation and validation of SBOMs, which helps maintain integrity, supports compliance
  with industry standards, and mitigates risks associated with unpatched software.
rationale: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management is crucial for identifying
  and tracking the components within a container image. Without SBOM management, there
  is an increased risk of using outdated or vulnerable software components, which
  can be exploited by attackers. Misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches by allowing vulnerable libraries to remain unnoticed.
