service: pod
resource: pod
requirement: Disruption Budget Configured
title: Ensure Pod Disruption Budgets are Configured
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes pods have an associated Pod Disruption
  Budget configured. A PDB sets a limit on the number of disruptions that can occur
  at any one time, ensuring that a minimum number of pods remain available. Proper
  configuration of disruption budgets helps maintain application availability and
  resilience against planned disruptions, reducing the risk of accidental denial of
  service during maintenance operations.
rationale: Without a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB), critical applications may experience
  unexpected downtime during voluntary disruptions, such as node maintenance or cluster
  scaling. This can lead to service unavailability and impact the resilience of applications,
  potentially opening up avenues for denial-of-service attacks if critical services
  are unavailable.
