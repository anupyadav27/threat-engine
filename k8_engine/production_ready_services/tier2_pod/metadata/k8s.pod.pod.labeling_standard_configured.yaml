requirement: Labeling Standard Configured
title: Enforce Pod Labeling Standards for Security Compliance
description: This control verifies that all Kubernetes pods adhere to a predefined
  labeling scheme. The labeling standard should include labels for environment, application
  type, and compliance status, among others. Proper labeling enhances security by
  facilitating effective resource management, enabling precise network policies, and
  simplifying monitoring and logging. It ensures that security policies can be applied
  consistently across the cluster, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring
  compliance with security best practices such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without standardized labeling, it becomes challenging to manage and secure
  workloads across a Kubernetes cluster. Proper labeling helps in organizing resources,
  enforcing security policies, and controlling access using tools like RBAC. Misconfigured
  or absent labels can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and difficulties
  in auditing and monitoring, which can be exploited by attackers to move laterally
  within the cluster.
