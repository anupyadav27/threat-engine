requirement: Compliance Check
title: Ensure Pod Security Standards are Enforced
description: This control checks that Kubernetes pods adhere to defined Pod Security
  Standards, ensuring configurations align with best practices for security. Validations
  focus on preventing privilege escalation, enforcing strict access controls, and
  ensuring secure runtime configurations. Good configuration includes disabling host
  networking, ensuring containers run as non-root users, and enforcing read-only root
  file systems. Implementing these standards mitigates risks of container escapes,
  unauthorized access, and data breaches.
rationale: Without enforcing Pod Security Standards, Kubernetes pods may be susceptible
  to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation, unauthorized network access, and
  resource hijacking. Attackers can exploit misconfigurations to execute arbitrary
  code, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
