service: pod
resource: pod
requirement: Falco Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Falco Security Monitoring on Kubernetes Pods
description: This rule checks that Falco, an open-source runtime security tool, is
  enabled and correctly configured on Kubernetes pods. Proper configuration involves
  ensuring Falco is actively monitoring for suspicious behavior using predefined security
  rules. This helps identify unauthorized actions, such as running non-whitelisted
  processes or modifying system binaries, thereby enhancing the security posture by
  providing real-time alerts and mitigating risks before they escalate.
rationale: Without enforcing Falco for runtime security monitoring, pods are vulnerable
  to unnoticed malicious activity such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
  and data exfiltration. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in running containers,
  leading to potential breaches and disruption of services.
