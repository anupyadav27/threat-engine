requirement: Autoscaler Enabled
title: Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for Resource Management
description: This rule checks if the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is enabled and configured
  correctly for Kubernetes pods. A properly configured HPA dynamically adjusts the
  number of pod replicas based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics,
  ensuring efficient resource utilization. This proactive resource management helps
  mitigate risks associated with resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks
  by automatically scaling pods in response to demand spikes, thus maintaining service
  reliability and security.
rationale: Without enabling the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Kubernetes pods may
  become overutilized, leading to performance degradation and potential denial-of-service
  conditions. Unmanaged resource consumption can exhaust cluster resources, making
  it easier for attackers to launch resource-based attacks or disrupt service availability.
