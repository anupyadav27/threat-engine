rule_id: k8s.pod.pod.resource_limits_configured
service: pod
resource: pod
requirement: Resource Limits Configured
title: Enforce Resource Limits on Pods
description: This rule ensures that every Kubernetes pod is configured with explicit
  CPU and memory resource limits. It verifies that both 'requests' and 'limits' are
  set for resources to prevent any pod from monopolizing node resources. Proper configuration
  provides isolation between workloads, preventing resource contention and ensuring
  fair resource distribution across all running applications, thus maintaining system
  stability and protecting against denial-of-service attacks.
rationale: Without resource limits, a single pod can consume excessive CPU or memory
  resources, potentially leading to node instability, application downtime, and denial
  of service (DoS) conditions. Attackers may exploit misconfigured resource limits
  to disrupt services or degrade system performance, impacting availability.
