requirement: Termination Grace Period Configured
title: Enforce Pod Termination Grace Period Configuration
description: This control checks whether each Kubernetes pod has a termination grace
  period configured. A well-defined termination grace period allows applications to
  handle termination signals appropriately, ensuring that all necessary shutdown routines
  are executed. This reduces the risk of leaving sensitive data in an inconsistent
  state, prevents resource leaks, and mitigates potential attack vectors where abruptly
  terminated processes might be exploited. The recommended practice is to set a termination
  grace period that aligns with the application's shutdown process requirements, typically
  30 seconds or more, depending on the application.
rationale: A properly configured termination grace period ensures that a pod has enough
  time to gracefully terminate its processes, which helps preserve data integrity
  and allows for proper resource cleanup. Without this, abrupt termination may lead
  to data corruption, potential security vulnerabilities, or inconsistent states which
  could be exploited by attackers.
