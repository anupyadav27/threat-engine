service: pod
resource: container
requirement: Config Enforced
title: Ensure Pod Configuration is Enforced with PodSecurityPolicy
description: This rule checks that PodSecurityPolicies (PSP) or Pod Security Admission
  (PSA) are enforced on all pods. It ensures that configurations such as privilege
  escalation, host network usage, and container capabilities are restricted according
  to predefined security policies. Proper configuration helps in adhering to security
  benchmarks, preventing unauthorized access, and mitigating potential security threats
  by enforcing a consistent security posture across the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Improperly configured pod settings can lead to vulnerabilities such as
  privilege escalation, unauthorized network access, and data breaches. Attackers
  may exploit misconfigurations to execute arbitrary code, gain elevated privileges,
  or access sensitive data. Enforcing configuration policies ensures that all pods
  adhere to security best practices, reducing the risk of such attacks.
