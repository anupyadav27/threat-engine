resource: security
requirement: Standard Vulnerability Checks
title: Implement Comprehensive Pod Vulnerability Scanning
description: This control ensures that Kubernetes pods undergo comprehensive vulnerability
  scanning to identify and mitigate known security vulnerabilities. The scanning process
  should include assessing images for known vulnerabilities before deployment and
  continuously monitoring running pods for newly discovered vulnerabilities. A proper
  configuration involves integrating vulnerability scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline
  and enabling runtime scanning to detect vulnerabilities in active pods. By implementing
  this control, organizations can proactively address security weaknesses, reduce
  the attack surface, and maintain compliance with industry security standards.
rationale: Neglecting to perform comprehensive vulnerability scans on Kubernetes pods
  can lead to the exploitation of known vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to compromise
  containerized applications. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and disruption of services by exploiting outdated or misconfigured software components
  within the pods.
