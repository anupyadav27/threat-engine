requirement: Anomaly Detection Enabled
title: Enable Anomaly Detection in Pod Deployments
description: Checks if anomaly detection mechanisms are enabled for pod deployments
  to identify deviations from normal behavior. This includes monitoring CPU/memory
  usage patterns and network traffic. Proper configuration involves integrating with
  tools that support anomaly detection, such as Kubernetes-native solutions or external
  monitoring systems. This helps in early detection of potential threats, enabling
  prompt response to mitigate risks.
rationale: Without anomaly detection, abnormal behavior and potential security incidents
  in pod deployments may go unnoticed, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access,
  or service disruption. Attack vectors include privilege escalation and exploitation
  of unpatched vulnerabilities.
