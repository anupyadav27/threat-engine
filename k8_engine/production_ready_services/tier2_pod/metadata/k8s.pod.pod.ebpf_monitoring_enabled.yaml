requirement: Ebpf Monitoring Enabled
title: Enable eBPF Monitoring in Pods for Threat Detection
description: This control checks if eBPF monitoring is enabled on Kubernetes pods,
  which facilitates real-time kernel-level monitoring and tracing. Proper eBPF configuration
  allows for the detection of anomalous system calls and network traffic, enhancing
  the visibility of pod activities and enabling quicker incident response. A correctly
  configured setup includes eBPF programs that are actively collecting and reporting
  data to a monitoring system, thus ensuring compliance with best security practices
  and detection capabilities.
rationale: Without eBPF monitoring, malicious activities such as unauthorized network
  connections or process executions can go undetected in Kubernetes pods. This exposes
  the cluster to potential lateral movement by attackers and makes it challenging
  to trace the source of security incidents.
