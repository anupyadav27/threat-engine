requirement: Network Disabled
title: Disable Host Network for Pods to Limit Exposure
description: This control checks whether the 'hostNetwork' field is set to false in
  pod specifications. A secure configuration ensures that pods do not share the host's
  network namespace. This isolation prevents pods from accessing the host's network
  interfaces and services directly, thereby limiting the impact of compromised pods
  and enhancing network security within the cluster. Proper configuration also aligns
  with security best practices and compliance standards such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Allowing pods to use the host's network namespace can lead to significant
  security risks, such as unauthorized access to the host network, potential privilege
  escalation, and lateral movement within the cluster. Attackers may exploit this
  to intercept sensitive data or disrupt network services. Disabling host networking
  minimizes these risks by isolating pod networks, thus reducing the attack surface.
