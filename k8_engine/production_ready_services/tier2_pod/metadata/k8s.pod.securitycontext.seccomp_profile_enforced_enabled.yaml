title: Enforce Seccomp Profile in Pod SecurityContext
description: This control checks if a Seccomp profile is explicitly set to either
  'runtime/default' or a custom profile in the pod's SecurityContext. A properly configured
  Seccomp profile limits the set of system calls that a container can make, thereby
  minimizing the potential for malicious activity. Enabling seccomp profiles helps
  adhere to security best practices and complies with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark,
  reducing the risk of container escape and other forms of attacks.
rationale: Without enforcing a Seccomp profile, pods may execute system calls that
  could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
  Seccomp acts as an additional layer of defense by restricting the system calls available
  to a container, reducing the attack surface and preventing the exploitation of kernel
  vulnerabilities.
