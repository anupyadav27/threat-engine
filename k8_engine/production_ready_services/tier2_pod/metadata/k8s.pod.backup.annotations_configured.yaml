requirement: Annotations Configured
title: Ensure Pod Backups Have Security Annotations
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes pod backups include necessary
  security annotations as per defined policies. Annotations are metadata that help
  manage and enforce security measures, such as specifying backup retention policies
  or encryption requirements. Proper configuration ensures that backups are consistently
  handled according to security best practices, reducing the risk of exposure or unauthorized
  access. It also aids in maintaining compliance with frameworks like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark by ensuring that security configurations are consistently applied.
rationale: Properly configured annotations on pod backups are crucial for enforcing
  security policies and ensuring compliance with organizational and industry standards.
  Without these annotations, there is a risk of misconfigurations leading to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, or failure to meet regulatory requirements such as NIST SP
  800-53. Attackers could exploit unannotated or misconfigured backups to gain insights
  into sensitive application data or operations.
