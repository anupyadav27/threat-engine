requirement: Inventory Maintained
title: Enforce Consistent Pod Labeling for Inventory Management
description: This control checks that all pods have consistent and predefined labels
  that adhere to organizational inventory management policies. A good configuration
  involves having a standard set of labels for each pod, which may include application
  name, environment, version, and owner. This practice helps in operational visibility,
  resource allocation, and applying security policies more efficiently. By ensuring
  proper labeling, organizations can prevent unauthorized access, quickly identify
  unapproved or rogue workloads, and maintain compliance with security standards.
rationale: Inconsistent or missing pod labels can lead to poor inventory management,
  making it difficult to track and monitor resources effectively. This can expose
  the cluster to risks such as unauthorized access, misconfiguration, and inefficient
  resource utilization. Attackers can exploit untracked pods to persist malicious
  workloads or evade detection.
