requirement: Limits Set
title: Enforce Pod Resource Limit Configuration
description: This rule checks that each Kubernetes pod has defined resource limits
  for CPU and memory. Configuring these limits ensures that no single pod can overuse
  cluster resources, which is essential for maintaining system stability and security.
  Proper configuration involves setting 'limits.cpu' and 'limits.memory' in the pod
  specification. This practice mitigates the risk of resource starvation for other
  pods and contributes to compliance with security benchmarks such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Setting resource limits on pods is crucial to prevent resource exhaustion
  attacks, which can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by monopolizing cluster resources.
  Without limits, a rogue or compromised pod could consume excessive CPU or memory,
  affecting the availability and performance of other applications. This configuration
  also aids in maintaining predictable performance and enforcing fair resource sharing
  across applications.
