resource: pod
requirement: Annotations Maintained
title: Ensure Critical Annotations Are Applied to Pods
description: This rule checks whether required critical annotations are applied and
  maintained on Kubernetes pods. Proper annotations can trigger security policies
  through admission controllers, facilitate auditing, and ensure compliance with security
  standards. A secure configuration involves ensuring that annotations related to
  security policies, such as `seccomp`, `appArmor`, and network policies, are present
  and correctly configured. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and enhances
  compliance with security benchmarks.
rationale: Annotations in Kubernetes pods provide metadata that can be used for security
  policies, monitoring, and automation. If critical annotations are missing or misconfigured,
  it may lead to security gaps such as unauthorized access, lack of audit trails,
  or misconfigured network policies. Attack vectors include privilege escalation within
  the cluster or data exfiltration due to inadequate logging and monitoring.
