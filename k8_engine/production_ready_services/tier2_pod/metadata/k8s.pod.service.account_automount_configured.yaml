title: Disable Default Service Account Token Automount in Pods
description: 'This check ensures that Kubernetes pods are configured to not automatically
  mount the default service account token unless explicitly required. By setting `automountServiceAccountToken:
  false` in the pod specification, you prevent unnecessary exposure of credentials
  that could be used by an attacker to escalate privileges. This configuration reduces
  the attack surface by limiting access to the Kubernetes API and aligns with security
  best practices and the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.'
rationale: If the default service account token is automatically mounted in pods,
  it can be exploited by an attacker who gains access to the pod. This could lead
  to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to interact with the Kubernetes API
  server and potentially perform unauthorized actions within the cluster.
