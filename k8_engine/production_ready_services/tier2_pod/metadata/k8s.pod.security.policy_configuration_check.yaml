resource: security
requirement: Policy Configuration Check
title: Enforce Pod Security Admission Policies
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes Pod Security Admission (PSA) policies
  are correctly configured to enforce security best practices. It validates the presence
  of policies that restrict the use of privileged containers, host namespaces, and
  potentially dangerous capabilities. A well-configured PSA ensures that all pods
  meet the organization's security requirements before they are allowed to run, significantly
  reducing the attack surface and preventing the deployment of insecure workloads.
rationale: Without properly configured pod security policies, Kubernetes clusters
  are vulnerable to privilege escalation, data breaches, and unauthorized access.
  Attackers could exploit misconfigured pods to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges,
  or access sensitive data within the cluster. Proper policy enforcement helps mitigate
  these risks by ensuring that only compliant pods are deployed.
