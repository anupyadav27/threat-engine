title: Ensure Automatic Kubernetes Patch Management is Enabled
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes clusters have automatic patch management
  enabled, ensuring that security patches and updates are applied promptly. Proper
  configuration involves enabling automated processes that check for and apply patches
  to Kubernetes components, such as the kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager.
  This practice helps minimize the attack surface by ensuring that known vulnerabilities
  are mitigated swiftly, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and compromise.
rationale: Failure to enable automatic patch management can expose Kubernetes clusters
  to known vulnerabilities, as unpatched software is a common target for attackers.
  Without timely application of patches, critical security updates may not be implemented,
  leaving the system susceptible to exploitation through well-documented attack vectors
  such as privilege escalation and remote code execution.
