requirement: Snapshot Enabled
title: Ensure Persistent Volume Snapshots are Enabled and Properly Configured
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes Persistent Volumes have snapshot
  features enabled and configured according to best practices. A properly configured
  snapshot policy ensures regular, consistent backups and secure storage of snapshots.
  This helps in recovering from data loss events and mitigates the risk of data corruption
  or loss due to malicious activities. A good configuration includes setting up scheduled
  snapshots, maintaining a history of snapshots, and ensuring snapshots are stored
  securely with access controls.
rationale: Without enabled and properly configured snapshots, persistent data on volumes
  may be lost in the event of accidental deletions or malicious attacks, such as ransomware
  or data corruption. Snapshots provide a mechanism for data recovery, allowing for
  restoration to a previous state, thereby protecting against data integrity issues
  and ensuring business continuity.
