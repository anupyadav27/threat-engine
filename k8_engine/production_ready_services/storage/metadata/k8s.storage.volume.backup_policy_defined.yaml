requirement: Backup Policy Defined
title: Enforce Backup Policies for Persistent Volumes
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes Persistent Volumes have an associated
  backup policy in place. A proper backup policy ensures that data is regularly copied
  and can be restored in case of failure or data loss. It should include details such
  as backup frequency, retention periods, and recovery procedures. Implementing and
  validating these policies helps mitigate risks associated with data loss, supports
  disaster recovery efforts, and aligns with security best practices.
rationale: Without a defined backup policy for Persistent Volumes, critical data may
  be lost due to accidental deletion, corruption, or malicious attacks, including
  ransomware. A lack of backups increases the risk of prolonged downtime and data
  breaches, as attackers could exploit this to cause intentional data loss or demand
  ransom.
