rule_id: k8s.ingress.tls.certificate_expiration_check
service: ingress
resource: tls
requirement: Certificate Expiration Check
title: Ensure Ingress TLS Certificates Are Valid and Not Expired
description: This rule checks that all TLS certificates used in Kubernetes Ingress
  resources are currently valid and not expired. It ensures that certificates used
  for encrypting traffic between clients and services are not outdated, which could
  otherwise lead to failed secure connections or security vulnerabilities. A valid
  TLS configuration helps ensure encrypted data transmission, protects against eavesdropping,
  and complies with security frameworks like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: TLS certificates that are expired or invalid can expose applications to
  man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches as they fail to
  establish a secure communication channel. Attackers can exploit expired certificates
  to impersonate services, leading to data interception and compromise. Proper certificate
  management is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
