requirement: Tls Protocols Configured
title: Enforce Secure TLS Protocols in Ingress Controllers
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes ingress controllers are configured
  to use strong, secure TLS protocols and ciphers, specifically prioritizing TLS 1.2
  and above while disabling deprecated versions such as TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Ensuring
  proper TLS configuration mitigates risks of outdated encryption methods, enhances
  protection against eavesdropping and data breaches, and aligns with stringent compliance
  standards like PCI DSS and CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A secure configuration also
  includes the use of robust ciphers and ensuring certificate validity.
rationale: If TLS protocols in Kubernetes ingress controllers are not properly configured,
  it exposes the cluster to vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks, data
  leakage, and unauthorized data access. Attackers could exploit weak or deprecated
  TLS protocols to intercept or tamper with data in transit, undermining both data
  integrity and confidentiality.
