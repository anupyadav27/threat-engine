rule_id: k8s.ingress.certificate.expiration_check
service: ingress
resource: certificate
requirement: Expiration Check
title: Enforce Ingress Certificate Expiration Monitoring
description: This rule checks that all Kubernetes ingress certificates are monitored
  for expiration and are renewed before they expire. A valid certificate ensures encrypted
  communication between clients and services, maintaining confidentiality and integrity
  of data in transit. By ensuring certificates are current, the risk of unauthorized
  access due to expired encryption mechanisms is minimized. This control is critical
  for maintaining compliance with security best practices and regulations like PCI
  DSS.
rationale: Failure to monitor and renew ingress certificates before expiration can
  lead to service disruptions and potential security breaches. Expired certificates
  may cause data exposure to man-in-the-middle attacks, as secure communication channels
  become vulnerable when certificates are not renewed on time.
