requirement: Enforced
title: Enforce TLS in Ingress Resources
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes ingress resources have TLS configurations
  properly enforced. A valid TLS configuration requires specifying the `tls` field
  in ingress resources with correctly set `hosts` and `secretName` attributes. By
  ensuring TLS is enforced, data integrity and confidentiality between clients and
  services are maintained, thus protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring
  compliance with security best practices.
rationale: Without enforcing TLS, data transmitted between clients and services may
  be exposed to eavesdropping or tampering by attackers. This can lead to the interception
  of sensitive information or unauthorized access to services, especially in scenarios
  where ingress resources expose services to the internet.
