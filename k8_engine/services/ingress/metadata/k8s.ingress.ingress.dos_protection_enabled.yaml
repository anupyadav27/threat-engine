service: ingress
resource: ingress
requirement: Dos Protection Enabled
title: Enable DoS Protection for Kubernetes Ingress
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes Ingress resources have Denial of
  Service (DoS) protection mechanisms enabled. Proper configuration involves setting
  rate limiting and connection limits to mitigate the risk of DoS attacks. Ensuring
  these settings are in place helps maintain service availability and protects against
  resource exhaustion, aligning with best security practices.
rationale: Without DoS protection, Kubernetes Ingress resources are vulnerable to
  Denial of Service attacks, which can overwhelm applications, degrade performance,
  and lead to outages. Attackers might exploit this by sending a large volume of requests
  to exhaust system resources, potentially causing service downtime and impacting
  availability.
