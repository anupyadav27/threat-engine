rule_id: k8s.ingress.controller.tls_enforced
service: ingress
resource: controller
requirement: Tls Enforced
title: Enforce TLS in Kubernetes Ingress Controllers
description: This rule checks that TLS is configured and enforced on all Kubernetes
  ingress controllers. A correct configuration includes specifying TLS certificates
  and ensuring all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS. This practice ensures that
  data in transit is encrypted, maintaining confidentiality and integrity, and aligns
  with industry standards for data protection.
rationale: Without TLS enforced on ingress controllers, data transmitted between clients
  and services is vulnerable to interception and tampering by attackers, leading to
  potential data breaches and MITM attacks. This poses a significant security risk,
  especially when handling sensitive information, and can result in non-compliance
  with standards like PCI DSS.
