rule_id: k8s.ingress.ingress.tls_enforced
service: ingress
resource: ingress
requirement: Tls Enforced
title: Enforce TLS on Kubernetes Ingress Resources
description: This rule checks that all Kubernetes Ingress resources have TLS configured
  properly by verifying the presence of a valid TLS section within the Ingress specification.
  A correctly configured TLS ensures that data transmitted between clients and services
  is encrypted, maintaining confidentiality and integrity. Implementing TLS on Ingress
  resources reduces the risk of unauthorized data access and strengthens the overall
  security of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Failing to enforce TLS on Ingress resources exposes data in transit to
  eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This misconfiguration can also lead
  to sensitive information leakage and non-compliance with security standards, increasing
  the risk of data breaches and regulatory fines.
