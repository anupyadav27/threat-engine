rule_id: k8s.ingress.controller.ssl_protocols_check
service: ingress
resource: controller
requirement: Ssl Protocols Check
title: Enforce Secure SSL Protocols in Ingress Controllers
description: This rule checks that the ingress controllers in a Kubernetes cluster
  are configured to use only secure SSL/TLS protocols, such as TLS 1.2 or higher.
  This involves verifying the `ssl-protocols` setting in ingress controller configurations
  to ensure deprecated protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 are not in use. Proper configuration
  prevents the use of weak encryption algorithms, reduces the risk of eavesdropping,
  and ensures compliance with standards such as PCI DSS and the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Using outdated or insecure SSL/TLS protocols in ingress controllers exposes
  applications to vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception,
  and protocol downgrade attacks. Ensuring only secure protocols are enabled protects
  sensitive data in transit and complies with security standards.
