requirement: Protection Enabled
title: Enable Ingress DoS Protection for Mitigating Traffic Floods
description: This rule ensures that Denial of Service (DoS) protection is enabled
  on Kubernetes ingress resources. It checks for configurations such as rate limiting
  and IP whitelisting that are crucial in mitigating excessive traffic floods. Properly
  configured ingress DoS protections can prevent unauthorized traffic spikes and maintain
  the availability and reliability of applications by limiting the impact of potential
  DoS attacks.
rationale: Ingress DoS protection is crucial as it mitigates the risk of Denial of
  Service attacks that can overwhelm Kubernetes clusters with excessive traffic, causing
  service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential financial losses. Without
  proper protection, attackers can exploit ingress points to flood services with malicious
  requests, leading to downtime and degraded performance.
