rule_id: k8s.ingress.no.public_access
service: ingress
resource: 'no'
requirement: Public Access
title: Restrict Public Access to Kubernetes Ingress Resources
description: This check ensures that Kubernetes ingress resources are not publicly
  accessible by default. It validates that ingress resources are configured with appropriate
  host whitelisting, HTTPS/TLS encryption, and network policies to restrict access
  to trusted sources only. By limiting public exposure, this control helps mitigate
  the risk of unauthorized access and protects sensitive applications and data from
  external threats.
rationale: Exposing Kubernetes ingress resources to the public internet without proper
  controls can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Attackers
  can exploit misconfigured ingress resources to access internal services, leading
  to information leakage, service disruption, or further lateral attacks within the
  cluster.
