rule_id: k8s.ingress.ingress.certificate_expiration_configured
service: ingress
resource: ingress
requirement: Certificate Expiration Configured
title: Ensure Ingress Certificates Have Expiration Dates Set
description: This rule checks that all TLS certificates used in Kubernetes ingress
  resources have defined expiration dates. A valid configuration includes certificates
  that are regularly rotated and monitored for expiration. Proper expiration settings
  ensure that certificates are updated before they become invalid, reducing the risk
  of service disruptions and enhancing the security of data transmitted over the network.
rationale: Failing to configure expiration dates on ingress certificates increases
  the risk of using outdated, compromised, or insecure certificates. Attackers could
  exploit expired certificates to impersonate services, intercept sensitive data,
  or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.
