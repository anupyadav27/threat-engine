requirement: No User Resources
title: Ensure Default Namespace is Free of User-Defined Resources
description: This control checks that the default namespace does not contain any user-created
  resources such as pods, services, or deployments. A clean default namespace prevents
  misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. By ensuring no user
  resources are deployed here, it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and helps
  maintain a clear separation of workloads, which is critical for auditability and
  compliance with security standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: The default namespace in Kubernetes is often a target for attacks due to
  its common usage and accessibility. Allowing user-defined resources in the default
  namespace can lead to accidental exposure of sensitive resources, privilege escalation,
  and potential namespace pollution. Misconfigurations here can be exploited by attackers
  to gain unauthorized access to resources, deploy malicious workloads, or disrupt
  services.
