service: namespace
resource: dedicated
requirement: For Clearinghouse
title: Isolate Clearinghouse Functions in Dedicated Namespace
description: This rule checks that clearinghouse operations are contained within a
  dedicated Kubernetes namespace. A dedicated namespace provides a logical boundary
  that enforces security policies such as network policies, resource quotas, and RBAC
  tailored specifically for sensitive clearinghouse activities. Proper namespace isolation
  prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data and ensures that access controls
  are appropriately enforced. This configuration aligns with best practices for securing
  critical services by limiting the blast radius of potential security incidents.
rationale: Using a dedicated namespace for clearinghouse functions isolates sensitive
  operations, reducing the risk of namespace-level attacks such as privilege escalation
  or unauthorized resource access. In a multi-tenant cluster, this separation ensures
  that misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in one namespace do not compromise others,
  thus maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulations like HIPAA.
