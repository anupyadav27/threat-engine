requirement: Dedicated For Clearinghouse Configured
title: Ensure Dedicated Namespace for Clearinghouse Operations
description: This control checks that a dedicated namespace is configured specifically
  for clearinghouse operations. A properly configured namespace should have specific
  network policies, resource quotas, and access controls that restrict operations
  to only the required resources and users. This ensures that sensitive operations
  related to clearinghouse activities are isolated from other application components,
  mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, and compliance violations.
rationale: Misconfiguration of namespaces can lead to unauthorized access and privilege
  escalation. By dedicating a specific namespace for clearinghouse operations, you
  isolate sensitive operations from other workloads, reducing the risk of lateral
  movement by attackers and minimizing the attack surface.
