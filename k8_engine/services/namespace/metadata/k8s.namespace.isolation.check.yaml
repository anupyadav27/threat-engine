requirement: Check
title: Ensure Namespace Network Policies are Configured
description: This check ensures that Kubernetes namespaces have network policies configured
  to restrict traffic between pods and external endpoints. Properly configured network
  policies act as a firewall for pod communication, allowing only explicitly permitted
  traffic. This reduces the attack surface by preventing unauthorized access and data
  leakage, and it aligns with best practices for secure multi-tenancy in Kubernetes
  environments.
rationale: Without proper network policy configurations, namespaces can communicate
  freely with each other, potentially allowing attackers to move laterally within
  the cluster. This can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources.
