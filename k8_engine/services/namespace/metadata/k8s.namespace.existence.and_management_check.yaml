requirement: And Management Check
title: Enforce Namespace Existence and Access Management
description: This control verifies that all necessary namespaces exist in the Kubernetes
  cluster and that their access is properly managed through Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC). It ensures namespaces are not missing, preventing potential disruptions
  in service operations. Additionally, it checks for configured access controls, ensuring
  that only authorized users and services can interact with resources within each
  namespace. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby
  maintaining isolation and compliance with security best practices.
rationale: Namespaces are fundamental security boundaries within Kubernetes. Misconfigured
  namespaces can lead to unauthorized access and resource conflicts, enabling potential
  privilege escalation or denial-of-service attacks. Proper management is critical
  to maintaining secure and isolated environments for workloads.
