title: Ensure Namespace Isolation for Multi-Tenancy Security
description: This rule verifies that namespaces are configured to ensure isolation
  between workloads, particularly in a multi-tenant environment. It checks for appropriate
  use of NetworkPolicies, ResourceQuotas, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to
  prevent resource contention and unauthorized access. Proper namespace isolation
  mitigates risks by restricting communication and access to resources, ensuring that
  tenants operate within their defined boundaries.
rationale: Without proper namespace isolation, there is a risk of privilege escalation
  and unauthorized access between tenants. Attackers could exploit misconfigured namespaces
  to access sensitive resources across the cluster, leading to data breaches and denial-of-service
  attacks.
