requirement: Audit Enabled
title: Enable Audit Logging for Network Policy Changes
description: This control checks that audit logging is enabled for changes to Kubernetes
  network policies. A proper configuration involves setting up audit policies to log
  all modifications to resource objects related to network policies. This helps in
  tracing unauthorized changes, ensuring accountability, and maintaining compliance
  with security standards. Enabling audit logging for network changes ensures that
  any attempts to modify network configurations are logged and can be reviewed for
  suspicious activity.
rationale: Without audit logging for network policy changes, malicious or unauthorized
  modifications can go undetected, potentially leading to security breaches. Attackers
  could exploit this to alter network configurations, allowing unauthorized access
  or data exfiltration.
