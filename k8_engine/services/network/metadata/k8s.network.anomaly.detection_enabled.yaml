requirement: Detection Enabled
title: Enable Network Anomaly Detection for Threat Mitigation
description: This rule checks if network anomaly detection is enabled across your
  Kubernetes clusters. Properly configured anomaly detection tools can identify deviations
  from normal network patterns, flagging potential security incidents. This involves
  monitoring network traffic and employing machine learning techniques to detect anomalies.
  A good configuration includes setting up alerts and integrating with logging systems
  to ensure timely response to threats, thereby enhancing the overall security posture
  of your Kubernetes deployments.
rationale: Network anomaly detection is crucial for identifying and mitigating potential
  security threats such as unauthorized access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
  Without it, malicious activities may go unnoticed, allowing attackers to exploit
  vulnerabilities within the Kubernetes environment. This can lead to data breaches
  and compromised workloads.
