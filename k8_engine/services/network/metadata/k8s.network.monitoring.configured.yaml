title: Ensure Network Monitoring Tools Are Properly Configured
description: This control verifies that network monitoring solutions are correctly
  configured within a Kubernetes cluster. A well-configured network monitoring setup
  includes specifying appropriate alert thresholds, monitoring critical network paths,
  and integrating with logging and alerting systems. Ensuring these configurations
  helps in quickly identifying and mitigating potential security threats, maintaining
  the integrity and availability of the cluster.
rationale: Improper configuration of network monitoring tools can lead to undetected
  network anomalies, exposing the cluster to risks such as data breaches or lateral
  movement by attackers. Without effective monitoring, it becomes challenging to detect
  and respond to unauthorized access or unusual network activities, increasing the
  potential for prolonged security incidents.
