title: Enforce Network Policies to Restrict Admin Protocols
description: This control checks whether network policies are in place to restrict
  access to administrative protocols like SSH and RDP. A proper configuration should
  define network policies that explicitly allow only specific pods or namespaces to
  communicate over these protocols, based on the principle of least privilege. By
  ensuring these configurations, it minimizes the attack surface, prevents unauthorized
  access, and aligns with compliance requirements such as those specified in the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to restrict administrative protocols such as SSH and RDP can lead
  to unauthorized access, exposing the cluster to potential breaches. Attackers could
  exploit these protocols to gain control over the cluster, exfiltrate data, or disrupt
  services. Implementing network policies helps mitigate the risk of lateral movement
  and privilege escalation within the cluster.
