requirement: Alerts Configured
title: Configure Network Monitoring Alerts for Anomalous Traffic
description: This rule checks that network monitoring tools are configured to generate
  alerts for anomalous traffic patterns and potential security incidents in the Kubernetes
  cluster. A well-configured alert system should cover unusual ingress/egress patterns,
  unauthorized access attempts, or abnormal resource consumption, helping to detect
  and mitigate threats quickly. It ensures compliance with security best practices
  and regulatory standards by providing visibility into the network layer, thus protecting
  sensitive workloads and data.
rationale: Failure to properly configure network monitoring alerts can lead to undetected
  malicious activities such as data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, or lateral
  movement within the cluster. Alerts provide real-time notifications of suspicious
  activities, enabling rapid incident response and minimizing potential damage.
