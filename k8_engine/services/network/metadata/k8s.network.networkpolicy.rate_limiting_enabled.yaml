service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Rate Limiting Enabled
title: Enforce Rate Limiting in Network Policies
description: This rule checks whether rate limiting is configured in Kubernetes network
  policies. A properly configured rate limit ensures that excessive or malicious traffic
  is controlled, protecting services from being overwhelmed. Effective rate limiting
  is essential for maintaining service availability and performance, preventing denial-of-service
  attacks, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
rationale: Without rate limiting, Kubernetes network policies may allow excessive
  requests, leading to denial-of-service attacks or resource exhaustion. Attack vectors
  include malicious actors flooding services with requests to degrade performance
  or cause downtime.
