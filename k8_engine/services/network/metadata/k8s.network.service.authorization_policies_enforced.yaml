service: network
resource: service
requirement: Authorization Policies Enforced
title: Enforce Network Service Authorization Policies
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes network services have proper authorization
  policies configured using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The configuration should
  ensure that only authenticated and authorized entities can access network services,
  thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access and meeting compliance requirements.
  A secure setup should include clearly defined roles and permissions, restricting
  access based on the principle of least privilege. This enhances the security posture
  by preventing unauthorized lateral movement and access to sensitive data.
rationale: Without enforced authorization policies, Kubernetes network services are
  vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within the cluster.
  This can lead to data breaches and exploitation through privilege escalation or
  unauthorized resource manipulation.
