service: network
resource: isolate
requirement: Healthcare Clearinghouse
title: Implement Network Policies to Isolate Healthcare Data
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes network policies are implemented to isolate
  workloads handling healthcare data, ensuring that only authorized services can communicate
  with these workloads. A correctly configured network policy restricts traffic to
  and from healthcare-related pods, reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  access. Proper implementation aids in compliance with regulations like HIPAA, safeguarding
  patient data and maintaining data integrity.
rationale: Without proper network isolation, sensitive healthcare data could be exposed
  to unauthorized access or lateral movement within the cluster, making it vulnerable
  to data breaches. Attack vectors such as compromised pods or misconfigured services
  can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to data or escalate privileges.
