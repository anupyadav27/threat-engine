title: Ensure TLS Encryption for Ingress Traffic in Network Policies
description: This control checks that all ingress traffic defined by Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
  is encrypted using TLS. A properly configured NetworkPolicy should specify that
  connections to services utilize TLS, ensuring that all data in transit is securely
  encrypted. This safeguard helps protect sensitive information from being exposed
  during transmission. By enforcing TLS, organizations can prevent unauthorized data
  interception and meet compliance requirements such as those outlined in the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, sensitive data transmitted over the network can
  be intercepted by attackers through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, leading to
  data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards. TLS ensures data integrity
  and confidentiality, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized data access.
