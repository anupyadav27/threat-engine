rule_id: k8s.network.ingress.ingress_controller_secure_enabled
service: network
resource: ingress
requirement: Ingress Controller Secure Enabled
title: Enable TLS for Ingress Controllers
description: This rule checks that all ingress controllers have TLS enabled to encrypt
  traffic between clients and services. A properly configured ingress controller with
  TLS helps ensure data confidentiality and integrity by encrypting data in transit.
  This configuration mitigates risks of unauthorized access and data leakage, aligning
  with industry best practices and standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without enabling TLS for ingress controllers, data transmitted between
  clients and services can be intercepted and manipulated by attackers, leading to
  potential data breaches. Attack vectors include man-in-the-middle attacks where
  traffic is intercepted and modified, and eavesdropping on sensitive information.
