title: Enable and Configure Network Flow Logs for Security Monitoring
description: This control checks if network flow logging is enabled and properly configured
  in the Kubernetes environment. A correct configuration involves enabling logs for
  all network flows and ensuring that they are retained for an appropriate duration
  to support forensic investigations. This setup aids in monitoring network traffic,
  detecting unusual patterns, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations and
  standards. Properly configured network flow logs can help detect unauthorized access
  attempts, data breaches, and other security incidents, allowing timely response
  and mitigation.
rationale: Without proper logging of network flows, detecting and investigating unauthorized
  access or data exfiltration becomes challenging. Network flow logs provide critical
  insights into the communication patterns and potential anomalous behavior within
  the Kubernetes cluster, helping to identify security incidents and mitigate risks
  such as DDoS attacks or lateral movement by attackers.
