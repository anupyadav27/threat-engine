requirement: In Transit Enabled
title: Ensure Network Traffic is Encrypted In Transit
description: This check verifies that all network communications within the Kubernetes
  cluster are encrypted using TLS. A proper configuration involves ensuring that all
  components, including the API server, kubelets, and etcd, are set to use TLS for
  all network traffic. This mitigates risks associated with data interception and
  unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and compliant
  with industry standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without encryption in transit, data transmitted between Kubernetes components
  can be intercepted by attackers, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized
  access. Attackers can exploit unencrypted traffic to perform man-in-the-middle attacks,
  compromising sensitive information and jeopardizing the integrity of the cluster.
