rule_id: k8s.network.networkpolicy.restricted_to_security_services
service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Restricted To Security Services
title: Restrict Network Policies to Security Services Only
description: This rule checks that network policies are configured to specifically
  allow only necessary traffic to security services within the Kubernetes cluster.
  By limiting network communication pathways, it mitigates risks such as unauthorized
  access and data exfiltration. A properly configured network policy ensures that
  only defined ingress and egress traffic is permitted, thereby enforcing a zero-trust
  network model and aligning with best practices and compliance standards.
rationale: Restricting network policies to security services prevents unauthorized
  access and lateral movement within the cluster. Misconfiguration can expose sensitive
  information and services to potential attackers, increasing the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized data manipulation.
