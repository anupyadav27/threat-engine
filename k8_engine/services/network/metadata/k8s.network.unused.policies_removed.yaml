title: Remove Unused Network Policies for Enhanced Security
description: This check ensures that any unused network policies in the Kubernetes
  environment are identified and removed. A good configuration involves actively managing
  and auditing network policies to ensure they are necessary, up-to-date, and aligned
  with current security requirements. By removing unused policies, you minimize the
  potential for misconfigurations and security loopholes that attackers could exploit,
  thereby improving the overall security posture of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Unused network policies in Kubernetes can lead to unnecessary complexity
  and potential security vulnerabilities. Attackers may exploit these unused policies
  to conduct lateral movement or reconnaissance within the cluster, increasing the
  risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Removing unused policies helps maintain
  the principle of least privilege and reduces the attack surface.
