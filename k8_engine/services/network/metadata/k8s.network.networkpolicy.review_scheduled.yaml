requirement: Review Scheduled
title: Enforce Regular NetworkPolicy Reviews for Compliance
description: This control checks that a schedule for reviewing Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
  is in place and adhered to. A proper schedule ensures that NetworkPolicies are evaluated
  regularly to maintain optimal security configurations. By enforcing this practice,
  organizations can prevent stale policies that might allow unauthorized network traffic,
  reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining compliance with security standards.
rationale: Neglecting regular reviews of Kubernetes NetworkPolicies can lead to outdated
  or overly permissive configurations, exposing the cluster to unauthorized access
  and lateral movement by attackers. Regular reviews help ensure policies are up-to-date
  with the current security requirements and threat landscape.
