requirement: Traffic Restricted
title: Enforce Network Policies for Internal Traffic Restriction
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes internal network traffic is restricted
  using Network Policies. It checks for policies that explicitly allow only necessary
  traffic between pods, namespaces, and external services, minimizing the risk of
  unauthorized access. A well-configured network policy should define ingress and
  egress rules, ensuring that only the required traffic is permitted. This reduces
  the attack surface and helps in maintaining compliance with security benchmarks
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without properly configured network policies, internal Kubernetes traffic
  is susceptible to lateral movement attacks. Unauthorized access could lead to data
  breaches and compromise of cluster integrity. Network policies serve as a critical
  control to prevent attackers from exploiting misconfigured services or vulnerabilities
  within the internal network.
