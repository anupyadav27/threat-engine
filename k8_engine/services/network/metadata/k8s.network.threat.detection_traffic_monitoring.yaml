resource: threat
requirement: Detection Traffic Monitoring
title: Enable and Configure Network Traffic Monitoring in Kubernetes
description: This control checks if Kubernetes clusters have network traffic monitoring
  enabled, ensuring that all ingress and egress traffic is logged and analyzed for
  anomalies. Proper configurations involve using tools like network policy controllers
  or service meshes to enforce and monitor network communications. This setup helps
  in identifying unusual traffic patterns, detecting potential breaches early, and
  maintaining compliance with security standards. A robust network traffic monitoring
  configuration includes defining comprehensive network policies, using logging tools
  to capture traffic details, and integrating with SIEM systems for ongoing threat
  analysis.
rationale: Without effective network traffic monitoring, Kubernetes environments are
  vulnerable to undetected anomalous activities, such as lateral movement attacks,
  data exfiltration, and DDoS. Attackers could exploit misconfigured network policies
  to compromise workloads and access sensitive data, posing significant risks to confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability.
