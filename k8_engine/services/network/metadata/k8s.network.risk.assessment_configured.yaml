requirement: Assessment Configured
title: Enforce Network Policy Configuration
description: This rule checks for the presence and correct configuration of Network
  Policies within a Kubernetes cluster. A well-configured Network Policy ensures that
  only allowed traffic can flow between pods, namespaces, or external endpoints. It
  verifies that policies are defined for each namespace, preventing unrestricted pod-to-pod
  communication. This helps in enforcing the principle of least privilege, thus enhancing
  overall cluster security by minimizing potential attack vectors.
rationale: Without properly configured network policies, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable
  to lateral movement attacks, where attackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive
  workloads by exploiting overly permissive network configurations. Proper network
  policy configuration limits communication between pods, reducing the attack surface
  and mitigating risks such as data exfiltration and privilege escalation.
