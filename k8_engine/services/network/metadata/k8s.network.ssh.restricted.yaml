title: Restrict Direct SSH Access to Kubernetes Nodes
description: This control checks that SSH access to Kubernetes nodes is restricted
  according to best security practices. It ensures that SSH is disabled or only accessible
  through a bastion host with strict logging and monitoring. Proper configuration
  involves using tools like SSH key-based authentication, IP whitelisting, and enabling
  two-factor authentication if SSH is necessary. This helps prevent unauthorized access
  and maintains compliance with security benchmarks, such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark,
  by enforcing stringent access control measures.
rationale: Direct SSH access to Kubernetes nodes can expose critical infrastructure
  to unauthorized access and potential exploitation. Attackers gaining SSH access
  can execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, and compromise the entire cluster.
  Limiting SSH access reduces the attack surface and helps prevent unauthorized operations
  that could lead to data breaches or system disruptions.
