requirement: External Access
title: Restrict External Network Access Using Network Policies
description: This control checks for the presence and correct configuration of NetworkPolicies
  that limit external access to Kubernetes services. A properly configured NetworkPolicy
  should explicitly define allowed ingress and egress traffic, ensuring that only
  necessary communication is permitted to and from external networks. These configurations
  help in adhering to the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface,
  and aligning with best practices for secure network design.
rationale: Misconfiguring external network access can expose the cluster to unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Attackers could exploit open network paths to access sensitive
  resources, inject malicious traffic, or exfiltrate data. By restricting external
  network access, we mitigate risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized
  data exposure.
