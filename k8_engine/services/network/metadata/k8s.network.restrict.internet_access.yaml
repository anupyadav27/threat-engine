requirement: Internet Access
title: Enforce Network Policies to Restrict Pod Internet Access
description: This control checks for the presence and enforcement of network policies
  that restrict internet access for pods. A good configuration involves defining ingress
  and egress rules that specify allowed traffic sources and destinations, effectively
  blocking unnecessary internet communication. Implementing such network policies
  helps protect sensitive data, ensures regulatory compliance, and aligns with security
  best practices by minimizing potential attack vectors.
rationale: Allowing unrestricted internet access from pods increases the risk of data
  exfiltration, unauthorized communication with external endpoints, and exposure to
  internet-borne threats. Attackers who compromise a pod can exploit unrestricted
  internet access to pivot into other parts of the network or launch further attacks.
  By enforcing network policies, you can limit communication to only required endpoints,
  reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement.
