resource: external
requirement: Access Restricted
title: Restrict External Network Access via Network Policies
description: This rule checks that network policies are in place to restrict external
  access to Kubernetes services. A well-configured network policy specifies which
  ingress and egress traffic is allowed, thus preventing unauthorized access to resources
  within the cluster. This control helps enforce the principle of least privilege
  and ensures that only expected and secure connections are established, aligning
  with compliance standards and reducing the risk of external attacks.
rationale: Improperly configured external network access can expose sensitive Kubernetes
  workloads to unauthorized entities, leading to data breaches or denial-of-service
  attacks. Restricting access minimizes the attack surface by ensuring only legitimate,
  necessary connections are permitted.
