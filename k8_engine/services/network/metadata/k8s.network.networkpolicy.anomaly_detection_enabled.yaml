rule_id: k8s.network.networkpolicy.anomaly_detection_enabled
service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Anomaly Detection Enabled
title: Enable Anomaly Detection in Network Policies
description: This rule checks if anomaly detection mechanisms are enabled in Kubernetes
  network policies, ensuring that any irregular network traffic patterns are identified
  and flagged. A well-configured anomaly detection system helps in early identification
  of potential threats, allowing for timely response and mitigation. Good configuration
  involves setting up monitoring tools that integrate with network policies to track
  deviations from typical traffic patterns, providing insights into potential security
  incidents.
rationale: Without anomaly detection in network policies, unusual or malicious network
  activities may go unnoticed, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized
  access. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to bypass security
  controls, making it crucial to detect and respond to such anomalies promptly.
