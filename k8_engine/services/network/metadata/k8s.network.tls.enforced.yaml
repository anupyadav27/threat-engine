title: Enforce TLS Encryption for Kubernetes Network Traffic
description: This rule checks that TLS encryption is enforced for all network communications
  within the Kubernetes cluster. Proper enforcement of TLS ensures that data exchanged
  between Kubernetes components and with external services is encrypted, safeguarding
  against eavesdropping and data manipulation. A correctly configured TLS setup includes
  valid certificates and protocols that meet security standards, significantly reducing
  the risk of unauthorized data access.
rationale: Failing to enforce TLS for Kubernetes network traffic exposes data in transit
  to interception and tampering. Attackers could exploit unencrypted traffic to perform
  man-in-the-middle attacks, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or credentials.
