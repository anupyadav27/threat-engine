service: network
resource: suspicious
requirement: Activity Monitoring
title: Monitor Network Traffic for Suspicious Activity
description: This rule checks that network monitoring is configured to log and analyze
  traffic patterns for unusual activity in Kubernetes clusters. Effective monitoring
  involves setting up tools and policies to capture and review network data continuously.
  A well-configured monitoring system can alert administrators to unauthorized access
  attempts, unusual connection patterns, or data transfer activities, providing an
  opportunity to respond promptly to potential threats.
rationale: Without effective network activity monitoring, malicious actors can exploit
  unmonitored traffic to perform lateral movement, data exfiltration, or denial-of-service
  attacks. Proper monitoring helps identify anomalies and potential breaches early,
  reducing the risk of significant damage.
