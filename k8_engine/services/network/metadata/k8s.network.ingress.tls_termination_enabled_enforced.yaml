rule_id: k8s.network.ingress.tls_termination_enabled_enforced
service: network
resource: ingress
requirement: Tls Termination Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce TLS Termination on Ingress Resources
description: This rule verifies that TLS termination is properly enforced on all Kubernetes
  ingress resources. It checks for the presence of TLS configurations such as valid
  certificates and appropriate HTTPS endpoints. Proper enforcement ensures that all
  ingress traffic is encrypted, protecting data in transit and aligning with security
  best practices and compliance standards. This reduces the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized access.
rationale: Without TLS termination, data transmitted over the network is vulnerable
  to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers can exploit unencrypted
  ingress traffic to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, compromising
  confidentiality and integrity.
