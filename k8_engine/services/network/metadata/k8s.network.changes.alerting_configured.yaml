requirement: Alerting Configured
title: Configure Alerts for Kubernetes Network Policy Changes
description: This rule ensures that any changes to Kubernetes network policies trigger
  alerts to a monitoring system. It checks for the presence of alerting mechanisms
  that notify administrators of modifications to network configurations. A good configuration
  involves integrating network policy changes with centralized logging and alerting
  solutions like Prometheus or third-party monitoring tools. This approach enhances
  security by providing real-time visibility and response capabilities to unauthorized
  or accidental network policy modifications.
rationale: Network policy changes in Kubernetes, if unmonitored, can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Attackers might exploit misconfigured or untracked
  changes to gain lateral movement within the cluster, bypassing intended network
  restrictions. By configuring alerts, immediate detection and response to unexpected
  changes is possible, mitigating potential security incidents.
