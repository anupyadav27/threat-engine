requirement: Audit Enabled
title: Enable Auditing for Network Configuration Changes
description: This control checks that auditing is enabled for all network-related
  changes in the Kubernetes cluster. A good configuration ensures that every change
  to network policies, services, and ingress resources is logged. This logging is
  crucial for detecting unauthorized access attempts, tracing suspicious activity,
  and meeting compliance requirements. Proper audit logging enables quick identification
  and response to security incidents, helping to maintain the integrity and availability
  of the cluster.
rationale: Without audit logging for network configuration changes, unauthorized modifications
  may go unnoticed, leading to potential exposure of sensitive data or denial-of-service
  attacks. Attackers could exploit unmonitored changes to insert malicious configurations
  or disrupt service availability.
