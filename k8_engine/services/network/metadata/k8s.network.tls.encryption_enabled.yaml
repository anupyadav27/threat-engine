requirement: Encryption Enabled
title: Ensure TLS Encryption for Ingress Traffic
description: This rule checks that TLS encryption is enabled for all ingress traffic
  to Kubernetes services. It verifies that Ingress controllers are configured to use
  HTTPS with valid TLS certificates, ensuring that data is encrypted during transmission.
  Proper TLS configuration helps protect against eavesdropping, data tampering, and
  other network-based attacks. Ensuring TLS is enabled aligns with industry standards
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, which emphasizes the importance of encrypting
  sensitive data in transit.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, sensitive data transmitted between clients and
  Kubernetes services can be intercepted by attackers, leading to data breaches. Man-in-the-middle
  attacks are a significant risk when communication is not encrypted, allowing attackers
  to eavesdrop and potentially modify data in transit.
