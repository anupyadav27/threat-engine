title: Ensure Comprehensive Documentation for Kubernetes Network Policies
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes network policies are thoroughly
  documented to reflect their intended purpose and configuration. Proper documentation
  includes details of allowed and denied traffic, the namespaces and pods affected,
  and the rationale behind specific policy decisions. This ensures that network policies
  are correctly implemented and maintained, reducing the risk of security breaches
  and aiding in compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. Having
  well-documented network policies also facilitates audits and simplifies troubleshooting
  by providing clear guidance on network security intentions.
rationale: Undocumented or poorly documented network policies can lead to misconfigurations
  that expose services to unintended network traffic. This increases the risk of unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and lateral movement within the cluster by attackers exploiting
  network vulnerabilities.
