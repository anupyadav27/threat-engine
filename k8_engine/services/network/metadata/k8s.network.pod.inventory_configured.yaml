service: network
resource: pod
requirement: Inventory Configured
title: Ensure Pod Network Policy is Configured
description: This rule checks whether a Network Policy is applied to each pod to control
  the inbound and outbound traffic. A well-configured Network Policy allows you to
  specify how pods communicate with each other and other network endpoints, reducing
  the attack surface by limiting network exposure. Ensuring that every pod has a Network
  Policy helps achieve a defense-in-depth strategy by enforcing least privilege principles
  within network communications.
rationale: Without a properly configured Network Policy, pods may be exposed to unnecessary
  network traffic, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  or denial of service attacks. Misconfigured Network Policies can lead to unauthorized
  lateral movement within the cluster.
