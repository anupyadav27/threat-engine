service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Namespace Isolation Enforced
title: Enforce Namespace Isolation with Network Policies
description: This rule checks that Network Policies are configured to enforce isolation
  between namespaces. Proper configuration involves creating default deny-all ingress
  and egress policies for each namespace, ensuring that only explicitly defined traffic
  is permitted. By enforcing namespace isolation, you limit communications to only
  what is necessary, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks, and
  aligning with best practices for secure cluster configurations.
rationale: Without enforced namespace isolation, attackers can exploit network vulnerabilities
  to access resources across different namespaces, leading to potential data breaches
  and unauthorized access. Namespace isolation is critical in mitigating lateral movement
  within the cluster, reducing the attack surface, and ensuring that network traffic
  is explicitly allowed between namespaces only when necessary.
