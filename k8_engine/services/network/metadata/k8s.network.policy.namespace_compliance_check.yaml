service: network
resource: policy
requirement: Namespace Compliance Check
title: Enforce Namespace-Specific Network Policies
description: This rule checks for the presence and configuration of network policies
  that enforce traffic restrictions at the namespace level. It ensures that each namespace
  has a defined network policy to control inbound and outbound traffic. A well-configured
  policy limits the network communication to only required pods and services, reducing
  the attack surface by preventing unauthorized inter-namespace traffic, and ensuring
  compliance with security best practices such as those outlined in the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without namespace-specific network policies, there is a risk of unintended
  cross-namespace communication, which can lead to data leakage and unauthorized access.
  Attack vectors include lateral movement within clusters and exploitation of misconfigured
  network policies that allow access to sensitive resources across namespaces.
