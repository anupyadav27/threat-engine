service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Unused Policies Removed Configured
title: Remove Unused NetworkPolicies to Minimize Attack Surface
description: This rule checks for the presence of unused NetworkPolicies in the Kubernetes
  cluster. A good configuration ensures that only active and necessary NetworkPolicies
  are deployed, reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could expose the cluster
  to unauthorized access. By removing unused policies, clusters maintain a cleaner
  and more secure environment, which simplifies auditing and ensures that all policies
  are relevant and correctly applied to the intended workloads.
rationale: Unused NetworkPolicies can create confusion and increase the attack surface
  by allowing potential misconfigurations that attackers might exploit. They can also
  lead to an accumulation of stale configurations that make it harder to manage and
  audit network security effectively. If misconfigured, these policies might inadvertently
  allow unauthorized traffic, undermining the intended security posture.
