rule_id: k8s.network.no.public_access
service: network
resource: 'no'
requirement: Public Access
title: Restrict Public Network Access to Kubernetes Services
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes services are appropriately configured
  to restrict public access. Services should be exposed only to necessary internal
  networks or specific external IPs using network policies or ingress controllers.
  This helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures compliance with security standards
  by limiting exposure to only trusted entities.
rationale: Allowing public access to Kubernetes services increases the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Attackers can exploit exposed services to penetrate
  the network, leading to data exfiltration or service disruption. Properly restricting
  public access minimizes the attack surface and helps maintain a secure environment.
