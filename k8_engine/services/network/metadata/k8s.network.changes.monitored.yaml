requirement: Monitored
title: Monitor and Audit Kubernetes Network Configuration Changes
description: This control verifies that all network configuration changes, including
  those to Network Policies and Services, are monitored and logged. Proper monitoring
  involves setting up audit logs and alerts for changes to critical network components.
  A good configuration ensures that audit logs are stored securely and reviewed regularly.
  This aids in maintaining a secure cluster by ensuring any unauthorized or unexpected
  changes can be detected and remediated promptly, thereby enhancing compliance with
  security standards.
rationale: Unmonitored network configuration changes can lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Attackers may exploit unsecured network policies to
  gain lateral movement within the cluster, intercept sensitive data, or disrupt service
  availability. Ensuring these changes are tracked helps in early detection of suspicious
  activities and mitigates potential attack vectors.
