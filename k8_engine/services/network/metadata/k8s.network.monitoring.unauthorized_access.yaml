service: network
resource: monitoring
requirement: Unauthorized Access
title: Enforce Network Policy to Prevent Unauthorized Access
description: This control checks for the presence and enforcement of network policies
  that restrict access to Kubernetes network monitoring components. A well-defined
  network policy should specify which pods can communicate with network monitoring
  services, reducing the attack surface and mitigating risks of unauthorized access.
  It ensures that only legitimate and authenticated traffic is allowed, aligning with
  security best practices and regulatory compliance.
rationale: Without proper network policies, malicious actors can exploit unrestricted
  network access to perform lateral movement within the cluster, intercept sensitive
  data, or launch denial-of-service attacks. This misconfiguration can lead to data
  breaches and compromise the availability and integrity of critical applications.
