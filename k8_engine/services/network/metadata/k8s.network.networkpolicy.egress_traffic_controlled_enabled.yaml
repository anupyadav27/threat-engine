service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Egress Traffic Controlled Enabled
title: Enforce Egress Traffic Restrictions with NetworkPolicies
description: This rule checks for the presence of egress rules in Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
  to ensure that all outbound traffic is explicitly allowed or denied. A well-configured
  NetworkPolicy with egress controls restricts pods from communicating with external
  networks unless specifically permitted, thereby minimizing the attack surface and
  preventing data leakage. Proper egress restrictions are essential for adhering to
  security best practices and ensuring network segmentation.
rationale: Without controlling egress traffic, malicious insiders or compromised pods
  can exfiltrate sensitive data or communicate with unauthorized external systems.
  This can lead to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection standards.
  Attackers can exploit open egress to bypass firewall restrictions, making it crucial
  to enforce strict egress rules.
