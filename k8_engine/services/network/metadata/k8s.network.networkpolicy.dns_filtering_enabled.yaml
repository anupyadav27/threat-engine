service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Dns Filtering Enabled
title: Enable DNS Filtering in Network Policies
description: This control checks if Kubernetes NetworkPolicies have DNS filtering
  enabled, ensuring that only legitimate DNS traffic is allowed. A properly configured
  DNS filter in NetworkPolicies restricts DNS queries to known and trusted domains,
  significantly reducing the attack surface by preventing unauthorized DNS traffic
  from compromising the cluster. This security measure is essential for mitigating
  risks such as data exfiltration and unauthorized access through DNS-based techniques.
rationale: Without DNS filtering, malicious actors can exploit DNS requests to exfiltrate
  data, conduct command and control activities, or perform DNS tunneling attacks.
  This misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized data access, resource misuse, and
  compromised cluster integrity.
