requirement: Network Segmentation Enforced
title: Enforce Network Segmentation with Network Policies
description: This control checks for the presence and proper configuration of Network
  Policies within a Kubernetes cluster to enforce network segmentation. A valid configuration
  will define ingress and egress rules that restrict the communication between pods
  to only what is necessary. This reduces the attack surface by preventing unauthorized
  access and minimizing the potential impact of compromised pods. An adequately enforced
  Network Policy helps in achieving compliance with industry standards like the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark, which mandates restricting communication paths to mitigate
  risks.
rationale: Without enforced network segmentation, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable
  to lateral movement by attackers, unauthorized data access, and potential data exfiltration.
  Network Policies act as a firewall for controlling traffic flow at the IP address
  or port level, crucial for isolating workloads and adhering to the principle of
  least privilege.
