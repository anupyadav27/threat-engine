resource: restrict
requirement: Public Ip Access
title: Restrict Public IP Exposure for Kubernetes Services
description: This control checks that Kubernetes services do not have unrestricted
  public IP access unless explicitly required and secured. It ensures that LoadBalancer
  and NodePort services are configured with appropriate firewall rules or IP whitelisting
  to minimize exposure. Proper configuration helps prevent unauthorized access by
  ensuring that only trusted sources can interact with sensitive services, thus maintaining
  compliance with security standards and reducing the attack surface.
rationale: Exposing Kubernetes services to the public internet without restriction
  increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation. Attack vectors
  include brute force attacks, unauthorized data access, and service disruption by
  malicious actors exploiting open ports and services.
