rule_id: k8s.network.networkpolicy.no_public_ip_configured
service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: No Public Ip Configured
title: Restrict Public IP Exposure in NetworkPolicies
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes NetworkPolicies do not configure public
  IPs to limit exposure to external networks. Proper configuration ensures that only
  intended internal traffic is allowed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and
  aligning with security best practices. A secure configuration involves using private
  IPs and defining access control rules that limit traffic to specific internal sources
  and destinations.
rationale: Exposing network policies with public IPs can lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Attackers may exploit public IP exposure to bypass
  internal security controls and execute attacks such as DDoS or unauthorized data
  extraction.
