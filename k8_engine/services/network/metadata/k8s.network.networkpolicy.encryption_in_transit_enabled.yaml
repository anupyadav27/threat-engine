resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Encryption In Transit Enabled
title: Ensure Network Policies Enforce TLS for Ingress and Egress Traffic
description: This rule checks that all Kubernetes network policies enforce Transport
  Layer Security (TLS) for both ingress and egress traffic within the cluster. Properly
  configured network policies should specify the use of TLS to secure communications
  between pods and external services. This helps protect against data interception
  and ensures compliance with security best practices by maintaining confidentiality
  and integrity of the data transmitted across the network.
rationale: Without encryption in transit, data transmitted between services can be
  intercepted by attackers through man-in-the-middle attacks, leading to data breaches
  and exposure of sensitive information. Ensuring network policies enforce TLS mitigates
  these risks by encrypting data, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
