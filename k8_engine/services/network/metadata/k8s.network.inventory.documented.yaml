title: Maintain Comprehensive Network Inventory Documentation
description: This control checks that all components in the Kubernetes network inventory,
  such as services, pods, and network policies, are comprehensively documented. Proper
  documentation should include configurations, intended functions, and access controls.
  This ensures that the network architecture is transparent and auditable, reducing
  the risk of misconfigurations and unauthorized network changes. It supports security
  audits, facilitates incident response, and enhances compliance with security benchmarks
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without thorough documentation of the Kubernetes network inventory, administrators
  may overlook misconfigurations or unauthorized modifications, leading to potential
  security breaches. Attackers could exploit undocumented network paths to intercept
  or reroute traffic, access sensitive data, or escalate privileges within the cluster.
