title: Schedule Regular Network Policy Audits
description: This control checks that a schedule is in place for regular audits of
  Kubernetes network policies. A properly configured schedule ensures that network
  policies are reviewed and updated in accordance with the latest security best practices.
  This process helps identify and rectify any misconfigurations that could lead to
  unauthorized access or data exposure. It also supports compliance with security
  standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark by ensuring network policies are consistently
  aligned with current security requirements.
rationale: Without regular audits of network policies, there is a risk of outdated
  or misconfigured rules that could allow unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
  This can lead to potential security breaches such as lateral movement by attackers
  within the cluster or exposure of sensitive data.
