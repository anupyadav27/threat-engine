rule_id: k8s.network.networkpolicy.isolate_healthcare_clearinghouse_configured
service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Isolate Healthcare Clearinghouse Configured
title: Enforce NetworkPolicy for Healthcare Clearinghouse Isolation
description: This rule checks that a NetworkPolicy is implemented to isolate the healthcare
  clearinghouse namespace, ensuring that only approved communication is allowed. A
  properly configured NetworkPolicy restricts both ingress and egress traffic, which
  minimizes the attack surface by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive healthcare
  data and services. This control helps maintain compliance with industry standards
  by enforcing strict communication boundaries, thereby protecting patient information
  from unauthorized exposure.
rationale: Without a dedicated NetworkPolicy, sensitive data within the healthcare
  clearinghouse could be exposed to unauthorized internal or external entities. This
  misconfiguration increases the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential
  compliance violations with healthcare data protection regulations.
