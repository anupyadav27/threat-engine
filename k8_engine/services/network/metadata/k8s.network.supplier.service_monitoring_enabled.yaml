service: network
resource: supplier
requirement: Service Monitoring Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Service Monitoring for Network Suppliers
description: This control checks if service monitoring is enabled and correctly configured
  for network supplier services in Kubernetes. Properly configured service monitoring
  helps in early detection of anomalies, potential intrusions, or unauthorized activities
  by providing visibility into service health and performance. By ensuring that network
  suppliers have monitoring enabled, organizations can respond to threats more effectively,
  maintain compliance with security standards, and uphold the integrity of their Kubernetes
  environment.
rationale: Without proper service monitoring, malicious activities such as unauthorized
  access and data exfiltration in the network supplier services might go undetected,
  leading to potential breaches and compliance violations. Attackers could exploit
  misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the network services to pivot to other parts
  of the cluster.
