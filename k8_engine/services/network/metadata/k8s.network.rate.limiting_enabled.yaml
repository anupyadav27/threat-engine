title: Network Rate Limiting for Traffic Control
description: This control checks whether network rate limiting is configured for Kubernetes
  services and ingress resources. Proper configuration involves setting limits on
  the number of requests a client can make within a certain timeframe. Effective rate
  limiting helps protect the cluster from DoS attacks by ensuring that no single client
  can monopolize network resources. It ensures a balanced load across services, enhances
  availability, and contributes to a resilient infrastructure. The validation process
  involves reviewing Kubernetes configurations for Ingress resources and ensuring
  that rate limit policies are correctly applied according to best practices.
rationale: Without network rate limiting, Kubernetes clusters are susceptible to Denial
  of Service (DoS) attacks, where an attacker may overwhelm the network by sending
  excessive requests. This can lead to service disruption, degraded performance, and
  increased costs, as resources are consumed beyond normal operating conditions. Proper
  rate limiting helps mitigate these risks by controlling the volume of traffic and
  ensuring fair resource usage.
