requirement: Mtls Enforced
title: Enforce mTLS for Service Communication
description: This control checks that mutual TLS (mTLS) is enabled for all service-to-service
  communication within the Kubernetes cluster. It verifies that services are configured
  to require certificate-based authentication and encryption for all network traffic,
  ensuring that only trusted entities can establish connections. A proper mTLS configuration
  includes setting up a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and issuing certificates
  to all services. This enhances security by preventing unauthorized entities from
  communicating with services, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining integrity.
rationale: Without mTLS, communication between services can be intercepted or tampered
  with by attackers. This increases the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where
  sensitive data can be read or altered. Enforcing mTLS ensures that data in transit
  is encrypted and transmitted only between authenticated services, mitigating the
  risk of eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
