title: Enforce mTLS for Pod-to-Pod Communications
description: This check ensures that mutual TLS (mTLS) is enforced for all pod-to-pod
  communications within the Kubernetes cluster. The validation process involves verifying
  that network policies are configured to require encrypted connections, leveraging
  tools like Istio or Linkerd for mTLS. Properly configured mTLS protects data in
  transit from eavesdropping and tampering, thereby reducing vulnerabilities to network-level
  attacks.
rationale: Without service-to-service encryption, sensitive data can be intercepted
  during transit between pods, exposing it to unauthorized access and potential man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This misconfiguration compromises data confidentiality and integrity, increasing
  the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations.
