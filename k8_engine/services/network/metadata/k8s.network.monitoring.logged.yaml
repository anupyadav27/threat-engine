title: Ensure Network Monitoring Logs All Traffic
description: This control verifies that network monitoring in Kubernetes is configured
  to log all network traffic, including ingress and egress. A well-configured logging
  system should capture details such as source and destination IPs, ports, and protocol
  used. This ensures that any anomalous or unauthorized network activities can be
  detected and investigated promptly. Proper logging configurations aid in incident
  response and forensic investigations, and help ensure compliance with security standards
  like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without comprehensive logging of network traffic, malicious activities
  such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or lateral movements within the
  cluster may go undetected. Attackers could exploit these gaps to persist in the
  environment or escalate privileges without leaving a trace.
