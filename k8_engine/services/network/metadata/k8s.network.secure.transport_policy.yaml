title: Enforce Network Policies for Secure Pod Communication
description: This control checks that Network Policies are applied to limit pod-to-pod
  communication based on defined rules, such as allowing traffic only from trusted
  sources or specific namespaces. By enforcing Network Policies, you can ensure that
  only authorized traffic is allowed within the cluster, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Properly configured Network Policies act as
  a form of micro-segmentation, providing an additional layer of security that aligns
  with security best practices and compliance requirements.
rationale: Without network policies, Kubernetes pods can communicate with each other
  without restriction, which can lead to unauthorized access and data exposure. This
  lack of control allows potential attackers to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
  to move laterally within the cluster, compromising sensitive data or services.
