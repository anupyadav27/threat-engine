resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Risk Assessment Configured
title: Enforce NetworkPolicy for Pod Communication Control
description: This rule checks that NetworkPolicies are implemented for all namespaces
  to ensure that pod-to-pod communication is restricted according to security best
  practices. A well-configured NetworkPolicy allows only necessary traffic, blocking
  unauthorized access and reducing the likelihood of a successful attack. Effective
  NetworkPolicy configurations are crucial for compliance with security frameworks
  like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and for maintaining a secure and controlled network
  environment.
rationale: Without properly configured NetworkPolicies, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable
  to unauthorized inter-pod communication, increasing the risk of lateral movement
  by attackers who exploit compromised pods to access sensitive data or escalate privileges.
  NetworkPolicies help mitigate these risks by explicitly defining allowed traffic
  paths, thereby reducing the attack surface.
