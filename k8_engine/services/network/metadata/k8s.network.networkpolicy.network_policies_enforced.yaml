service: network
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Network Policies Enforced
title: Enforce Network Policies for Pod Communication Control
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes clusters have network policies configured
  and enforced to control pod-to-pod communication. A proper configuration involves
  creating network policies that define allowed ingress and egress traffic for each
  pod, ensuring that only legitimate and necessary communications are permitted. This
  minimizes the attack surface, prevents unauthorized access, and aligns with security
  best practices by segmenting network traffic within the cluster.
rationale: Without network policies, all pods can communicate with each other by default,
  increasing the risk of lateral movement by attackers. Misconfigured or absent network
  policies can lead to unauthorized data access and potential data exfiltration if
  a pod is compromised.
