requirement: Internal Traffic Restricted
title: Enforce NetworkPolicies to Restrict Internal Traffic
description: This control checks if Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are configured to restrict
  internal traffic between pods and services. A well-defined NetworkPolicy should
  explicitly specify allowed traffic routes and block all others by default. This
  ensures that pods can only communicate with intended services, reducing the risk
  of lateral movement by unauthorized entities within the cluster. Proper configuration
  helps to enforce the principle of least privilege and is crucial for isolating workloads,
  thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Without proper NetworkPolicies, all internal traffic is allowed by default,
  potentially exposing services to lateral movement attacks. Misconfiguration can
  enable unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or service disruption as attackers
  exploit open communication paths within the cluster.
