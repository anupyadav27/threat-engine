resource: 'no'
requirement: Public Ip
title: Restrict Public IP Exposure for Kubernetes Services
description: This control checks that Kubernetes services do not have public IPs assigned
  unless absolutely necessary. It ensures that services intended for internal traffic
  are not inadvertently exposed to the internet. A secure configuration involves using
  internal IPs and leveraging Kubernetes Network Policies to regulate traffic. This
  reduces the risk of unauthorized access and aligns with industry best practices
  for securing workloads.
rationale: Exposing Kubernetes services with public IPs can lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Attackers can exploit exposed services to gain entry
  into the cluster, execute DDoS attacks, or intercept sensitive data. By restricting
  public IP exposure, you minimize the attack surface and protect the cluster from
  external threats.
