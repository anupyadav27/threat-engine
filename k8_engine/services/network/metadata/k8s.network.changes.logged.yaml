title: Audit Logging for Kubernetes Network Configuration Changes
description: This control checks for the presence and correct configuration of audit
  logging for all network changes within the Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that any
  changes to network policies, services, ingress, and egress rules are logged in detail.
  Properly configured audit logs should capture who made the change, what was changed,
  when the change occurred, and from where it was initiated. This logging is crucial
  for incident response, forensic analysis, and ensuring compliance with security
  standards, as it provides visibility into network configuration changes and helps
  in identifying unauthorized or potentially harmful modifications.
rationale: Without audit logging of network configuration changes, unauthorized or
  erroneous alterations can go undetected, potentially exposing the cluster to security
  vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or network disruptions.
  Attackers could exploit these changes to redirect traffic, bypass security controls,
  or launch man-in-the-middle attacks.
