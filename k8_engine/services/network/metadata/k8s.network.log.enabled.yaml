title: Enable and Configure Network Logging
description: This rule checks if network logging is enabled and properly configured
  in Kubernetes clusters. Proper network logging involves capturing detailed logs
  of network traffic, which includes source and destination IPs, ports, and protocols.
  This helps in detecting suspicious activities, maintaining audit trails, and supporting
  forensic investigations. Ensuring that network logs are enabled and configured according
  to best practices enhances visibility into network operations and aids in compliance
  with security standards.
rationale: Without network logging, malicious activities such as unauthorized access
  or data exfiltration can go undetected. Network logs provide critical insights into
  traffic patterns and anomalies, enabling quick response to security incidents and
  minimizing potential damage.
