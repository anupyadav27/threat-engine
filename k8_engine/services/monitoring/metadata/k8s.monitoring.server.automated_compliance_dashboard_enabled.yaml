service: monitoring
resource: server
requirement: Automated Compliance Dashboard Enabled
title: Enable Automated Compliance Dashboard for Monitoring Servers
description: This rule checks if the automated compliance dashboard is enabled on
  Kubernetes monitoring servers. The dashboard should be configured to continuously
  monitor and report on the system's compliance with security policies and standards
  like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A properly configured dashboard helps identify
  security risks in real-time, enforce compliance, and ensure that any deviations
  are quickly addressed, thereby mitigating potential threats and enhancing the overall
  security posture.
rationale: Without an automated compliance dashboard, vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes
  environment can go unnoticed, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data
  breaches. Attackers could exploit unmonitored security gaps, such as misconfigured
  permissions or outdated components, leading to potential regulatory non-compliance
  and system compromise.
