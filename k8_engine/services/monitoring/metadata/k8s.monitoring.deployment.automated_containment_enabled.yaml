requirement: Automated Containment Enabled
title: Enable Automated Containment in Monitoring Deployments
description: This control checks whether automated containment mechanisms, such as
  pod security policies or network policies, are enabled in Kubernetes monitoring
  deployments. Proper configuration involves setting up alerts and automated actions
  that restrict compromised resources, preventing unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
  This helps in reducing the attack surface and ensures prompt incident response,
  aligning with best practices and policies like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failing to enable automated containment can lead to delayed response to
  security incidents, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities or escalate privileges
  within the cluster. Automated containment quickly isolates compromised components,
  minimizing potential damage and preventing lateral movement within the infrastructure.
