requirement: Alerting System Configured
title: Ensure Alerting System is Configured for Monitoring Pods
description: This control verifies that an alerting system is properly configured
  for all Kubernetes monitoring pods. It ensures that alerts are set up to notify
  administrators of suspicious activities or configuration changes. A properly configured
  alerting system should be capable of detecting and reporting on key security events,
  such as unauthorized access attempts, resource spikes indicative of a denial-of-service
  attack, or configuration drifts. This setup helps maintain a proactive security
  stance by enabling timely responses to potential threats.
rationale: Without an alerting system, critical security events and anomalies in Kubernetes
  monitoring pods can go unnoticed, leaving the cluster vulnerable to breaches. Misconfigured
  or absent alerting systems can delay the detection of unauthorized access or misconfigurations,
  increasing the risk of data loss or corruption.
