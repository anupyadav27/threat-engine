requirement: Playbooks Automated Enabled
title: Enable Automated Playbooks for Monitoring Deployments
description: This control checks if automated playbooks are enabled for Kubernetes
  monitoring deployments. Automated playbooks ensure that security configurations
  are consistently applied across all monitoring components, reducing the risk of
  manual errors and non-compliance with security policies. A proper setup involves
  using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Ansible or Terraform to manage configurations,
  ensuring they are version-controlled and auditable. This approach helps in maintaining
  a secure and reliable monitoring setup, preventing potential breaches and ensuring
  alignment with industry best practices and standards.
rationale: Automating playbooks in Kubernetes monitoring deployments mitigates the
  risk of human error and ensures consistent application of security configurations.
  Without automation, there is a higher likelihood of misconfiguration, which can
  be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.
