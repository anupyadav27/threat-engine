service: monitoring
resource: server
requirement: Compliance Dashboard Automated
title: Automate Compliance Dashboard for Kubernetes Monitoring
description: This rule verifies that the Kubernetes monitoring server's compliance
  dashboard is set up for automated monitoring and reporting. It checks that the dashboard
  continuously scans for compliance with security benchmarks, like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark, and alerts on any deviations from specified configurations. A well-configured
  automated dashboard helps in early detection of vulnerabilities, minimizing the
  risk of unauthorized access and ensuring alignment with industry standards.
rationale: Without an automated compliance dashboard, security teams may overlook
  critical vulnerabilities and non-compliance issues in real-time. This could lead
  to potential breaches, as attackers can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities before
  they are detected and addressed manually. Automating this process ensures continuous
  monitoring and quick response to security threats.
