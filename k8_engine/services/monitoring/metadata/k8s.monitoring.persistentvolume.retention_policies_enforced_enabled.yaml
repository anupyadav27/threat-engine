requirement: Retention Policies Enforced Enabled
title: Enforce Retention Policies on PersistentVolumes for Data Security
description: This rule verifies that retention policies are configured on PersistentVolumes
  to automatically delete or archive data that is no longer needed. Proper retention
  policies help in minimizing data exposure by ensuring that data is stored only for
  as long as it is required. This configuration mitigates risks of unauthorized access
  by ensuring data is not kept beyond its useful lifecycle, thereby supporting compliance
  with data protection standards and reducing storage costs.
rationale: Without enforced retention policies on PersistentVolumes, sensitive data
  may be retained longer than necessary, increasing the risk of unauthorized access
  or data breaches. Attackers could exploit this to obtain outdated but sensitive
  information, leading to potential compliance violations and data leaks.
