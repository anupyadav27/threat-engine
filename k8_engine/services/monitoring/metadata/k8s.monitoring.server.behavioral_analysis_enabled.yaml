resource: server
requirement: Behavioral Analysis Enabled
title: Enable Behavioral Analysis on Monitoring Servers
description: This rule checks if behavioral analysis features are enabled on Kubernetes
  monitoring servers. A properly configured behavioral analysis system can detect
  deviations from normal server activity, such as unexpected resource usage or unauthorized
  access attempts. This proactive approach helps in identifying potential security
  threats early, mitigating risks like data breaches and service disruptions. An optimal
  configuration aligns with best practices, ensuring that alerts are generated for
  suspicious activities, thereby enhancing overall security posture.
rationale: Without behavioral analysis, anomalies and potential security incidents
  may go undetected, allowing malicious activities to persist within the cluster.
  Attackers could exploit this to escalate privileges, access sensitive information,
  or disrupt services.
