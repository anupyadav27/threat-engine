requirement: Correlation Enabled
title: Enable Log Correlation in Kubernetes Monitoring Servers
description: This control verifies that log correlation is enabled on Kubernetes monitoring
  servers. Proper configuration ensures that logs from various components and services
  are correlated, facilitating comprehensive security monitoring and incident response.
  A well-configured correlation system aggregates logs from different sources, applies
  timestamps, and connects related events, providing a coherent view of security-related
  activities. This helps in identifying security threats more efficiently, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
rationale: Without log correlation, detecting and investigating security incidents
  becomes challenging, as logs from different sources may not be linked, potentially
  allowing attackers to hide their tracks across multiple services. Enabling correlation
  ensures that all related logs can be analyzed together, improving detection of lateral
  movement and other malicious activities.
