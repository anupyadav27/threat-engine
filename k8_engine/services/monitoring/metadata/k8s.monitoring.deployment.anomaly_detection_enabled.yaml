requirement: Anomaly Detection Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Anomaly Detection in Monitoring Deployments
description: Checks that anomaly detection is enabled and properly configured within
  Kubernetes monitoring deployments. Proper configuration involves setting thresholds
  and alerts for unusual activities such as unexpected traffic spikes or abnormal
  resource usage patterns. By doing so, it assists in early detection of potential
  security threats, enabling timely responses to mitigate risks. This proactive approach
  helps maintain the integrity and availability of the cluster and aligns with security
  best practices.
rationale: Without anomaly detection enabled in monitoring deployments, unusual patterns
  indicating potential security breaches, such as unauthorized access attempts or
  resource misuse, may go unnoticed. This could lead to undetected attacks, data exfiltration,
  or service disruptions, especially in dynamic environments like Kubernetes where
  changes happen rapidly.
