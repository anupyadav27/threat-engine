title: Ensure Comprehensive Monitoring Alerts in Kubernetes
description: This control checks that monitoring alerts in Kubernetes are configured
  to cover critical events such as unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation,
  and resource usage anomalies. A well-configured alert system should include thresholds
  and triggers for unusual activities, ensuring that security teams are notified promptly.
  This reduces the risk of security incidents by enabling proactive measures and compliance
  with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without properly configured monitoring alerts, anomalous activities and
  security breaches can go undetected in a Kubernetes environment. This increases
  the risk of prolonged unauthorized access and data breaches, as attackers might
  exploit vulnerabilities without notice. Ensuring alerts are configured helps in
  early detection and response to potential threats, significantly reducing the attack
  surface.
