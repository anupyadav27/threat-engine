service: monitoring
resource: deployment
requirement: Forensic Data Collection Enabled
title: Enable Forensic Data Collection in Monitoring Deployments
description: This rule checks that forensic data collection is enabled in Kubernetes
  monitoring deployments. Proper configuration involves setting up logging and monitoring
  tools to capture detailed logs of system activities and changes. By ensuring forensic
  data collection is active, organizations can quickly detect security incidents,
  track unauthorized access, and comply with security standards. Good configuration
  includes using tools like Fluentd or Prometheus to gather logs and metrics, ensuring
  that logs are stored securely, and regularly reviewing and analyzing collected data
  to identify anomalies.
rationale: Without forensic data collection, detecting and investigating security
  incidents becomes difficult, leading to prolonged exposure and potential damage.
  Misconfiguration might allow attackers to erase traces of their activities, hindering
  incident response and analysis.
