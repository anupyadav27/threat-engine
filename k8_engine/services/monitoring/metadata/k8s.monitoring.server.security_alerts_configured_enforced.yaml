resource: server
requirement: Security Alerts Configured Enforced
title: Ensure Security Alerts are Configured in Kubernetes Monitoring
description: This control checks that security alerts are actively configured and
  enforced on the Kubernetes monitoring server. It ensures that alerts are set up
  to detect unauthorized access attempts, configuration changes, and potential security
  breaches. A well-configured alerting system provides timely notifications, enabling
  swift incident response and mitigating security risks. Properly enforced alerts
  align with security best practices and help maintain compliance with standards like
  the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without properly configured security alerts on the Kubernetes monitoring
  server, critical security incidents may go unnoticed, leading to potential data
  breaches or system compromises. Attack vectors such as unauthorized access or privilege
  escalation could exploit these gaps, causing severe damage to the infrastructure.
