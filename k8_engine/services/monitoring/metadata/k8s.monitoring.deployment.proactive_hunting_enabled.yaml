resource: deployment
requirement: Proactive Hunting Enabled
title: Enable Proactive Threat Hunting in Monitoring Deployments
description: This rule checks that proactive threat hunting is enabled and configured
  in Kubernetes monitoring deployments. A correct setup involves enabling anomaly
  detection, behavioral analysis, and continuous threat intelligence updates. Proactive
  monitoring helps quickly identify suspicious activities and potential threats, enhancing
  the security posture and ensuring compliance with best practices such as those outlined
  in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proactive threat hunting, malicious activities within the cluster
  may go undetected, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Attack
  vectors such as privilege escalation, lateral movement within the network, and exploitation
  of vulnerabilities can be identified and mitigated early with proactive monitoring.
