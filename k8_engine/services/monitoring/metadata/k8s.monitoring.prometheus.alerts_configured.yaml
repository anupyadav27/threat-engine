service: monitoring
resource: prometheus
requirement: Alerts Configured
title: Ensure Prometheus Alerts Are Configured Properly
description: This rule checks that Prometheus, used for monitoring Kubernetes, has
  alerts configured according to security best practices. A well-configured alerting
  system can promptly notify administrators of suspicious activities or resource anomalies.
  Proper alert configurations should cover key metrics like API server access, node
  resource usage, and pod status changes. This helps in maintaining operational visibility
  and ensures compliance with security standards by providing timely incident response
  capabilities.
rationale: Without properly configured alerts in Prometheus, security incidents may
  go unnoticed, allowing potential threats to exploit vulnerabilities within the Kubernetes
  cluster. Misconfigurations can lead to delayed detection of anomalous activities
  such as unauthorized access attempts or resource misuse, increasing the risk of
  data breaches and service disruptions.
