title: Enable Centralized Logging for Monitoring DaemonSets
description: This control verifies that all monitoring DaemonSets in the Kubernetes
  cluster are configured to send logs to a centralized logging system. A proper setup
  ensures that logs are collected in real-time and securely stored for analysis and
  compliance purposes. This configuration helps in detecting suspicious activities,
  auditing system access, and providing insights into potential security incidents.
rationale: Without centralized logging, security incidents can go unnoticed, as logs
  dispersed across nodes are difficult to aggregate and analyze. This can lead to
  delayed detection of unauthorized access, anomalies, or breaches, allowing attackers
  to persist undetected in the system.
