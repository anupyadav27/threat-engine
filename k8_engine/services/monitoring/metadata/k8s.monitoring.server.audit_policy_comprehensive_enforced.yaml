requirement: Audit Policy Comprehensive Enforced
title: Enforce Comprehensive Audit Policy on Kubernetes Monitoring Servers
description: This control checks that a comprehensive audit policy is enforced on
  Kubernetes monitoring servers. It validates the presence of audit configurations
  that capture significant events like authentication attempts, configuration changes,
  and access to sensitive resources. A well-configured audit policy enables detection
  of unauthorized activities and facilitates forensic investigations. A good configuration
  includes logging of successful and failed requests, access to secrets, and modifications
  to roles and bindings. This enhances security by providing visibility and traceability,
  which are critical for compliance with security standards such as CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without a comprehensive audit policy, malicious activities such as unauthorized
  access, privilege escalation, and data breaches may go undetected. Attackers could
  exploit this lack of visibility to compromise the cluster, exfiltrate sensitive
  data, or disrupt services. Implementing a thorough audit policy helps in identifying
  suspicious activities and ensuring accountability, thereby strengthening the overall
  security posture.
