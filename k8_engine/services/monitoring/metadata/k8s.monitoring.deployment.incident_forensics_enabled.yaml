requirement: Incident Forensics Enabled
title: Ensure Incident Forensics is Enabled in Monitoring Deployments
description: This check verifies that incident forensics are enabled in Kubernetes
  monitoring deployments by ensuring logging, monitoring, and audit trails are properly
  configured. A well-configured setup includes enabling audit logs, using tools like
  Falco for real-time anomaly detection, and ensuring logs are stored securely and
  are accessible for analysis. Properly configured incident forensics help in identifying
  unauthorized access, tracing attack vectors, and facilitating compliance with security
  standards.
rationale: Without incident forensics enabled, it becomes challenging to trace and
  analyze security incidents, potentially allowing attackers to obscure their activities
  and persist undetected. This can lead to prolonged breaches and failure to mitigate
  damage effectively.
