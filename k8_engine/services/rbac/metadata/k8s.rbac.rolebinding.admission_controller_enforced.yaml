rule_id: k8s.rbac.rolebinding.admission_controller_enforced
service: rbac
resource: rolebinding
requirement: Admission Controller Enforced
title: Enforce RoleBinding with Validating Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes RoleBindings are subject to validating
  admission controllers to ensure that permissions are only granted following security
  best practices. A properly configured admission controller evaluates RoleBinding
  objects before they are persisted in the cluster, preventing the application of
  policies that could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access. This helps
  maintain the principle of least privilege and mitigates risks associated with over-privileged
  roles.
rationale: If RoleBindings are not enforced through validating admission controllers,
  attackers could exploit misconfigurations to escalate privileges by binding excessive
  permissions to service accounts. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources or the ability to execute privileged operations within the cluster.
