service: rbac
resource: segregation
requirement: Of Duties Enforced
title: Enforce RBAC Segregation of Duties
description: This rule checks that RBAC roles and bindings are configured to ensure
  segregation of duties, where different users and service accounts have distinct
  sets of permissions necessary for their roles. A good configuration involves creating
  roles with the least privilege necessary for their tasks, and binding these roles
  to users or service accounts accordingly. This helps prevent privilege escalation,
  reduces the risk of accidental or malicious actions, and ensures that access to
  resources is appropriately restricted, thereby enhancing the security posture of
  the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Improper configuration of RBAC roles can lead to privilege escalation and
  unauthorized access. By not enforcing segregation of duties, a single user may gain
  excessive privileges, increasing the risk of insider threats and accidental misuse
  of resources. Attackers could exploit these misconfigurations to escalate privileges
  and compromise the Kubernetes cluster.
