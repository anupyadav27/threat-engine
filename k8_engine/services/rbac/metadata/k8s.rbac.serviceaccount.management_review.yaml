resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Management Review
title: Regular Review of ServiceAccount RBAC Permissions
description: This control checks that ServiceAccount RBAC permissions are periodically
  reviewed to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. A good configuration
  involves regularly auditing and updating role bindings associated with ServiceAccounts
  to remove unnecessary permissions. This reduces the attack surface by limiting the
  access each ServiceAccount has within the cluster, preventing potential privilege
  escalation attacks and minimizing the impact of compromised credentials.
rationale: If ServiceAccount RBAC permissions are not regularly reviewed, there is
  a risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to cluster resources. Attackers
  could exploit over-permissive roles or roles that are no longer necessary, potentially
  compromising the security of the cluster and the applications running within it.
