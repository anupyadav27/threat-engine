rule_id: k8s.rbac.unique.service_account_per_user
service: rbac
resource: unique
requirement: Service Account Per User
title: Assign Unique Service Accounts for Each User
description: This rule checks that each user operating within the Kubernetes cluster
  has been assigned a unique service account. A properly configured environment where
  each user has their own service account allows for granular permission settings
  tailored to the specific needs and roles of the user. It prevents users from gaining
  elevated privileges through shared accounts and simplifies auditing by associating
  actions directly with the responsible user. This setup aligns with security best
  practices and assists in compliance with regulatory standards by ensuring clear
  access boundaries and responsibilities.
rationale: Sharing service accounts among multiple users can lead to untracked and
  unauthorized access, increasing the risk of privilege escalation if a user's credentials
  are compromised. By assigning unique service accounts, you ensure accountability
  and traceability, as each user's actions can be individually monitored and audited.
  This configuration minimizes the impact of a potential breach and aligns with the
  principle of least privilege.
