service: rbac
resource: role
requirement: Break Glass Controls Enabled
title: Enable Emergency Access Controls for RBAC Roles
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes RBAC roles have emergency access controls,
  or 'break glass' procedures, configured. Such controls require that any use of elevated
  permissions during an emergency is temporary, logged, and approved. Proper setup
  involves defining specific conditions under which these roles can be used, ensuring
  that access is revoked immediately after the emergency, and maintaining an audit
  trail. This approach reduces the security risk of persistent elevated privileges
  and aids in compliance with best practices for access management.
rationale: Without proper emergency access controls, attackers or malicious insiders
  could exploit elevated privileges during a crisis, leading to unauthorized access
  to sensitive resources. This control mitigates the risk of privilege escalation
  attacks by ensuring that any emergency access is logged, justified, and time-bound.
