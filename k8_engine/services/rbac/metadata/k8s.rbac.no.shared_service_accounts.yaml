rule_id: k8s.rbac.no.shared_service_accounts
service: rbac
resource: 'no'
requirement: Shared Service Accounts
title: Ensure Unique Service Accounts Per Application
description: This rule checks that each application within the Kubernetes cluster
  uses a unique service account, rather than sharing one across multiple applications.
  A proper configuration involves defining distinct service accounts for each application
  and binding them with the least privilege necessary through RBAC policies. This
  reduces the risk of privilege escalation and limits the potential impact of a compromised
  application by isolating its access rights, thereby adhering to the principle of
  least privilege.
rationale: Sharing service accounts across multiple applications can lead to elevated
  privileges and unauthorized access. If a single application is compromised, an attacker
  can potentially gain access to all resources available to the shared service account.
  This increases the attack surface and can lead to data breaches, lateral movement,
  and privilege escalation within the cluster.
