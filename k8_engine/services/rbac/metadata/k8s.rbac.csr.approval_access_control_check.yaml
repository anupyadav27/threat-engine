service: rbac
resource: csr
requirement: Approval Access Control Check
title: Enforce CSR Approval Access Control via RBAC
description: This control checks that RBAC policies are correctly configured to restrict
  CSR approval to authorized personnel or systems only. A secure configuration ensures
  that certificate requests are reviewed and approved based on an established access
  policy, minimizing the risk of unauthorized certificate issuance. Properly configured
  RBAC for CSR approval aids in maintaining a secure and compliant Kubernetes environment
  by enforcing controlled access to certificate signing processes.
rationale: Improper configuration of RBAC for CSR approval can lead to unauthorized
  certificate signing, allowing attackers to establish trust within the cluster. This
  could enable man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access to cluster resources,
  and potential escalation of privileges.
