title: Regular Review of RBAC Policies to Prevent Over-Privilege
description: This control checks that a process is in place for the periodic review
  of Kubernetes RBAC roles and bindings. A well-structured review process involves
  evaluating current roles and permissions, ensuring they align with the principle
  of least privilege, and adjusting them as necessary. Effective reviews can help
  prevent privilege escalation attacks and ensure compliance with security best practices
  by identifying over-privileged accounts and reducing their access rights.
rationale: Without regular reviews of RBAC policies, there is a risk of over-privileged
  access which can lead to unauthorized actions within the cluster. Attackers could
  exploit excessive permissions to escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or
  disrupt services. Regular reviews help identify and rectify unnecessary or excessive
  permissions, mitigating potential security breaches.
