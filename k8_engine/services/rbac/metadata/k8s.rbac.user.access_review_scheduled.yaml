rule_id: k8s.rbac.user.access_review_scheduled
service: rbac
resource: user
requirement: Access Review Scheduled
title: Schedule Regular RBAC User Access Reviews
description: This control ensures that Kubernetes RBAC user access reviews are scheduled
  and conducted regularly. It validates that the access review process is configured
  to examine user permissions, ensuring they align with the principle of least privilege.
  Proper configuration involves setting up automated reminders or tasks to review
  and adjust user roles and permissions as necessary. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential privilege escalation, thus enhancing the overall security posture
  of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Failing to regularly review RBAC user access can lead to privilege creep,
  where users accumulate permissions they no longer need, increasing the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Attackers could exploit outdated permissions to gain elevated
  access and compromise the cluster's security.
