rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.token_auth_secure_enforced
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Token Auth Secure Enforced
title: Enforce Secure Token Authentication for Service Accounts
description: This rule checks that service account tokens are configured with secure
  authentication mechanisms, such as short-lived tokens, to prevent unauthorized API
  access. It ensures tokens are not overly permissive and are rotated regularly. Proper
  token configuration helps in minimizing the attack surface by adhering to the principle
  of least privilege and reducing the chance of token misuse.
rationale: Misconfigured token authentication for service accounts can lead to unauthorized
  access to the Kubernetes API, allowing attackers to perform malicious actions such
  as privilege escalation or data exfiltration. Secure token management mitigates
  risks of token leakage and abuse.
