service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Emergency Access Audit Enforced
title: Audit Emergency Access for Service Accounts
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes service accounts are configured
  to log and audit emergency access events. Proper configuration includes enabling
  audit logs for any privilege escalation or role changes associated with service
  accounts. This helps administrators monitor and track any unusual or unauthorized
  access patterns, ensuring that any elevation of permissions is justified and documented,
  thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Inadequate auditing of emergency access granted to service accounts can
  lead to undetected malicious activities or misuse of privileges. This can result
  in unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, and compromise of
  the Kubernetes cluster. Ensuring audits are in place helps detect and respond to
  such activities promptly, mitigating potential damage.
