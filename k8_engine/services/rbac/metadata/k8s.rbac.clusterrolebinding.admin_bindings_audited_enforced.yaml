service: rbac
resource: clusterrolebinding
requirement: Admin Bindings Audited Enforced
title: Audit Admin ClusterRoleBindings for Unauthorized Access
description: This control checks that all ClusterRoleBindings with admin privileges
  are logged and monitored for unauthorized changes. A properly configured audit log
  captures all access and modification events related to admin ClusterRoleBindings,
  allowing security teams to detect suspicious activities and respond promptly. Ensuring
  that audit logging is enforced helps maintain accountability and traceability of
  administrative actions, thus enhancing the overall security posture of the cluster.
rationale: If admin-level ClusterRoleBindings are not properly audited, it increases
  the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical resources within
  the Kubernetes cluster. Attackers could exploit these misconfigurations to gain
  elevated permissions, leading to potential data breaches or disruption of services.
