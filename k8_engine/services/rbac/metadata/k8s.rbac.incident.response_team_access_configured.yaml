resource: incident
requirement: Response Team Access Configured
title: Ensure RBAC Permissions for Incident Response Team
description: This control verifies that the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings
  in Kubernetes grant the incident response team appropriate access to resources necessary
  for incident handling. A good configuration involves defining roles and bindings
  that specifically allow the incident response team to view and manage incidents
  without granting excessive permissions. This ensures that the team can respond promptly
  while maintaining the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface
  and minimizing the risk of privilege escalation.
rationale: Without proper RBAC permissions, the incident response team may be hindered
  in accessing necessary resources during a security incident, leading to delayed
  remediation and potential escalation of threats. Misconfigurations could allow unauthorized
  users access or deny authorized users, increasing the risk of data breaches or extended
  downtime.
