rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.token_creation_access_check
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Token Creation Access Check
title: Restrict ServiceAccount Token Creation Privileges
description: This control checks whether ServiceAccounts have limited permissions
  for creating tokens. A secure configuration ensures that only the necessary ServiceAccounts
  have the capability to generate tokens, thus minimizing the exposure to potential
  compromise. By restricting token creation privileges, you mitigate the risk of privilege
  escalation and safeguard against unauthorized access to sensitive cluster operations.
  A good configuration involves defining precise RBAC roles and binding them appropriately
  to ServiceAccounts, ensuring that only trusted processes can create tokens when
  necessary.
rationale: If a ServiceAccount has excessive permissions to create tokens, it increases
  the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API.
  Attackers could exploit these privileges to impersonate other users or services,
  potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications of cluster resources.
