service: rbac
resource: separation
requirement: Of Duties Enforced
title: Enforce RBAC Separation of Duties
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is
  configured to enforce separation of duties, ensuring that roles are assigned to
  users based on the principle of least privilege. Proper configuration involves creating
  distinct roles with specific permissions that align with job functions and ensuring
  that no single user has excessive permissions. This limits the potential impact
  of compromised credentials and reduces the risk of accidental or malicious changes
  to the cluster.
rationale: Misconfiguring RBAC roles can lead to privilege escalation where users
  gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or perform unauthorized operations.
  This increases the risk of data breaches, service disruption, and potential compliance
  violations.
