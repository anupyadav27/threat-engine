service: rbac
resource: rolebinding
requirement: To Specific Namespaces
title: Restrict RoleBinding Scope to Specific Namespaces
description: This control checks that RoleBindings are configured to apply only to
  specific namespaces rather than cluster-wide. A good configuration ensures that
  the scope of permissions granted by RoleBindings is limited, reducing the risk of
  privilege escalation and unauthorized access. RoleBindings should be scoped to the
  least privileged namespace required for their purpose, aligning with the principle
  of least privilege and aiding compliance with security standards such as the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If RoleBindings are not restricted to specific namespaces, users can gain
  unauthorized access to resources across multiple namespaces, leading to potential
  data breaches. Attackers could exploit overly permissive RoleBindings to escalate
  privileges or exfiltrate sensitive information from the cluster.
