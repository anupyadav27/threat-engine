rule_id: k8s.rbac.user.identity_audit_enabled
service: rbac
resource: user
requirement: Identity Audit Enabled
title: Enable and Monitor RBAC User Identity Auditing
description: This control ensures that RBAC user identity auditing is enabled, capturing
  detailed logs of user activities within the Kubernetes cluster. Proper configuration
  involves setting up audit policies that log who accessed what resources and when.
  This audit trail is crucial for forensic analysis and compliance reporting, providing
  visibility into user actions and helping to identify suspicious behavior or unauthorized
  access attempts.
rationale: Without proper identity auditing in RBAC, unauthorized access and malicious
  activities may go undetected. Attackers could exploit weak audit trails to cover
  their tracks after gaining unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster, potentially
  exfiltrating data or modifying configurations without detection.
