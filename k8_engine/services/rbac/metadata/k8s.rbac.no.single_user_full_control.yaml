rule_id: k8s.rbac.no.single_user_full_control
service: rbac
resource: 'no'
requirement: Single User Full Control
title: Prevent Full Cluster Admin Privileges for Single User
description: This rule checks that no individual user account is assigned the cluster-admin
  role or equivalent permissions across the Kubernetes cluster. Best practices dictate
  using role-based access control (RBAC) to limit permissions according to the principle
  of least privilege, thereby reducing the attack surface and mitigating risks associated
  with credential compromise. A secure configuration ensures that users have only
  the permissions necessary to perform their tasks, limiting potential damage if an
  account is compromised.
rationale: If a single user is granted full cluster admin privileges, it poses a significant
  security risk as this user could potentially make unauthorized changes, access sensitive
  data, or disrupt services. This is especially dangerous if their credentials are
  compromised, allowing attackers to gain complete control over the cluster.
