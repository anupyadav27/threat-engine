resource: secret
requirement: Auto Rotation Configured
title: Enable Automatic Secret Rotation for Enhanced Security
description: This check ensures that Kubernetes secrets are configured for automatic
  rotation, which involves setting up mechanisms or tools that periodically update
  the secrets used by Kubernetes services. A proper configuration would typically
  involve integrating with tools like External Secrets Operator or Vault, which handle
  secret management and rotation. This proactive measure not only complies with best
  practices like those outlined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark but also enhances
  security by reducing the lifespan of any potentially compromised credentials.
rationale: Without automatic rotation, secrets may become susceptible to exposure
  and unauthorized access if they are not periodically updated. An attacker who gains
  access to static secrets could maintain persistent access to sensitive information.
  Auto-rotation mitigates this risk by regularly updating secrets, thereby reducing
  the attack window and improving resilience against credential-based attacks.
