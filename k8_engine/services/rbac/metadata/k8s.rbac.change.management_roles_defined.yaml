requirement: Management Roles Defined
title: Define and Enforce Management Roles in Kubernetes RBAC
description: This control verifies that management roles in Kubernetes RBAC are explicitly
  defined and properly configured according to best practices. It checks that roles
  have the minimum necessary permissions and that they are assigned to appropriate
  users or service accounts. A well-configured management role setup helps prevent
  unauthorized access, limits the potential impact of compromised accounts, and ensures
  compliance with security standards. Proper configuration involves using the principle
  of least privilege, regularly reviewing role bindings, and employing namespace-specific
  roles where applicable.
rationale: Failing to define and enforce management roles in Kubernetes RBAC can lead
  to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Attackers could exploit misconfigured
  roles to gain administrative control, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
  Proper role definitions mitigate these risks by ensuring that only authorized users
  have the necessary permissions to perform management tasks.
