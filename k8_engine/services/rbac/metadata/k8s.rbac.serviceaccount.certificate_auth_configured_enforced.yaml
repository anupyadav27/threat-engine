resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Certificate Auth Configured Enforced
title: Enforce Certificate-Based Authentication for Service Accounts
description: This control checks that service accounts in Kubernetes are configured
  to use certificate-based authentication, ensuring that every service account has
  a certificate issued by the cluster's certificate authority. Proper certificate
  management helps authenticate service accounts securely, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access. A well-configured certificate authentication process is essential for verifying
  the identity of service accounts and preventing security breaches.
rationale: Without certificate-based authentication, service accounts may be vulnerable
  to unauthorized access through insecure methods. This can lead to privilege escalation
  attacks or unauthorized actions within the cluster, potentially compromising sensitive
  workloads and data.
