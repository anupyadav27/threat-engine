requirement: Unique Identifiers
title: Ensure Unique ServiceAccount Identifiers for RBAC
description: This control checks that each ServiceAccount within the Kubernetes cluster
  has a unique identifier. A unique ServiceAccount identifier ensures that roles and
  permissions can be accurately assigned and audited, reducing the risk of privilege
  misuse. By confirming these identifiers are unique, you prevent security breaches
  that stem from misconfigured RBAC policies and enhance traceability and accountability
  within the cluster.
rationale: Without unique identifiers for ServiceAccounts, it's challenging to correctly
  implement role-based access controls (RBAC), which can lead to privilege escalation
  and unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit non-unique identifiers to impersonate
  service accounts, gain unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources, and potentially
  compromise the cluster.
