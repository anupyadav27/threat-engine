requirement: Mfa Enforced
title: Enforce MFA for Kubernetes Service Accounts
description: This control checks whether multi-factor authentication is enforced for
  Kubernetes service accounts. It ensures that any access to service accounts requires
  an additional verification factor beyond the standard credentials. A good configuration
  involves integrating an external identity provider that supports MFA, thereby adding
  a layer of security to prevent unauthorized access. This measure mitigates risks
  associated with credential theft and helps maintain the integrity of the Kubernetes
  environment.
rationale: Without multi-factor authentication (MFA), service accounts are vulnerable
  to unauthorized access if credentials are leaked or compromised. This can lead to
  privilege escalation, data breaches, and unauthorized actions within the cluster.
  Attackers can exploit stolen credentials to gain access to critical resources, potentially
  causing severe disruption or data loss.
