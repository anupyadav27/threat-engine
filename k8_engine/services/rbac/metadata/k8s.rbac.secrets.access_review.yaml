rule_id: k8s.rbac.secrets.access_review
service: rbac
resource: secrets
requirement: Access Review
title: Ensure RBAC Policies Limit Secret Access
description: This control checks that RBAC roles and role bindings are configured
  to restrict access to Kubernetes secrets only to those service accounts, users,
  or groups that absolutely need them. It ensures that only authorized entities have
  the ability to read or modify secrets, aligning with the principle of least privilege.
  A well-configured RBAC policy reduces the risk of data breaches by preventing unauthorized
  entities from accessing confidential information stored in secrets.
rationale: Improperly configured RBAC policies can lead to unauthorized access to
  secrets, which may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys,
  and tokens. If an attacker gains access to these secrets, they could exploit them
  to escalate privileges, access restricted resources, or compromise the entire cluster.
  This control is crucial for minimizing the attack surface and mitigating insider
  threats.
