resource: user
requirement: Registration Authorization Review
title: Enforce RBAC Authorization for User Registration
description: This control ensures that RBAC policies are correctly applied to manage
  user registration and authorization. It checks for appropriate role bindings that
  limit user capabilities to only authorized operations. Proper configuration involves
  defining roles and permissions that align with the principle of least privilege,
  ensuring that users can only access resources necessary for their function, thus
  minimizing potential attack vectors.
rationale: Without proper RBAC authorization for user registration, there is a risk
  of unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive resources within the cluster.
  This could lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or malicious activities
  by impersonating legitimate users.
