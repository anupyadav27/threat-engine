requirement: Role Cleanup
title: Remove Unused RBAC Roles
description: This rule checks for and identifies RBAC roles in the Kubernetes environment
  that are not currently in use. A role is considered unused if it is not bound to
  any subjects via RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. By ensuring regular cleanup
  of these unused roles, organizations can minimize the risk of privilege misuse and
  maintain a tighter access control policy, aligning with security best practices
  and compliance requirements.
rationale: Unused RBAC roles in Kubernetes can lead to security risks such as privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access. These roles may inadvertently provide permissions
  that can be exploited if compromised or mistakenly assigned. Removing unused roles
  reduces the attack surface and helps prevent threat actors from leveraging stale
  permissions.
