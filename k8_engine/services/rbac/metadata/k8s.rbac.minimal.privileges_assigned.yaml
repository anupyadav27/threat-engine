service: rbac
resource: minimal
requirement: Privileges Assigned
title: Enforce Least Privilege in Kubernetes RBAC Policies
description: This rule checks that RBAC policies adhere to the principle of least
  privilege by ensuring that roles and bindings grant only the necessary permissions
  required for users and service accounts to perform their functions. A good configuration
  involves defining roles with minimal scope and associating them with specific users
  or service accounts. This reduces the attack surface, limits potential damage from
  compromised credentials, and helps maintain compliance with security frameworks.
rationale: Misconfigured RBAC policies can grant excessive permissions, leading to
  unauthorized access and potential exploitation. Attackers may exploit overly permissive
  roles to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary commands, or access sensitive data,
  compromising cluster security and compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
