requirement: Review
title: Regular Review of RoleBindings for Least Privilege
description: This rule checks that RoleBindings in your Kubernetes cluster are regularly
  reviewed to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. A good configuration
  involves ensuring each RoleBinding grants only the necessary permissions needed
  for specific tasks and does not include wildcard or overly broad permissions. Regular
  reviews help prevent privilege escalation and unauthorized access, reinforcing your
  cluster's security posture.
rationale: Misconfigured RoleBindings can lead to excessive permissions, allowing
  unauthorized users or service accounts to escalate privileges or access sensitive
  resources. This increases the risk of data breaches and lateral movement within
  the cluster by malicious actors.
