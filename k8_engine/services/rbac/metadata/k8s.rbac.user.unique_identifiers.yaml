resource: user
requirement: Unique Identifiers
title: Ensure Unique User Identifiers in RBAC
description: This rule checks that each Kubernetes RBAC user is assigned a unique
  identifier to prevent identity overlap and maintain clear audit trails. A good configuration
  ensures that every user has distinct credentials, reducing the risk of identity
  spoofing and unauthorized access. This practice is essential for tracking user actions
  accurately and aligns with security best practices, helping to enforce principle
  of least privilege and support compliance with industry standards.
rationale: Using non-unique identifiers for Kubernetes RBAC users can lead to privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access. Attackers may exploit these identifiers to impersonate
  users or gain elevated permissions, thereby compromising the cluster's integrity
  and confidentiality.
