service: rbac
resource: change
requirement: Management Policy Configured
title: Enforce RBAC Change Management Policies
description: This control checks that RBAC change management policies are in place
  and properly configured to ensure that any modifications to RBAC permissions are
  logged, reviewed, and authorized. A well-configured management policy should enforce
  strict access controls, require multi-factor authentication for sensitive changes,
  and integrate with audit logging systems. This approach minimizes the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access, thereby maintaining the integrity and security
  of Kubernetes clusters.
rationale: Without proper management policies for RBAC changes, unauthorized users
  could escalate privileges or gain access to sensitive resources, leading to potential
  data breaches or system compromises. Attackers could exploit misconfigured RBAC
  to perform lateral movements within the cluster or execute unauthorized commands.
