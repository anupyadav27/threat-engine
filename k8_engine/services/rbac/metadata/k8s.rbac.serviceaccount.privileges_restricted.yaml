rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.privileges_restricted
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Privileges Restricted
title: Restrict ServiceAccount Privileges Using RBAC
description: This rule checks that all ServiceAccounts in the cluster have minimal
  necessary privileges by evaluating the RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings associated
  with them. A well-configured RBAC policy ensures that ServiceAccounts have the least
  privilege necessary, reducing the attack surface and mitigating the risk of privilege
  escalation. Properly restricting ServiceAccount permissions helps maintain compliance
  with security standards and keeps the cluster secure from unauthorized actions.
rationale: Misconfigured ServiceAccount privileges can lead to privilege escalation
  and unauthorized access within your Kubernetes cluster. Attackers could exploit
  excessive permissions to gain control over cluster resources, potentially leading
  to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
