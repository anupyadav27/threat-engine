rule_id: k8s.rbac.role.wildcard_permissions_prohibited_enforced
service: rbac
resource: role
requirement: Wildcard Permissions Prohibited Enforced
title: Disallow Wildcard Permissions in Kubernetes Roles
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes RBAC roles do not include wildcard permissions,
  which grant unrestricted access to resources. A secure configuration requires specifying
  exact permissions needed for each role, limiting the risk of privilege escalation
  and unauthorized access. By enforcing this control, you ensure that roles adhere
  to the principle of least privilege, enhancing overall cluster security and reducing
  potential attack surfaces.
rationale: Wildcard permissions in RBAC roles can lead to excessive privileges, enabling
  users or services to perform unauthorized actions across the cluster. This misconfiguration
  poses a risk of privilege escalation, data breaches, and unauthorized resource manipulation.
  Attackers can exploit these broad permissions to gain control over critical cluster
  resources.
