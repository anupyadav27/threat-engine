resource: cluster
requirement: Admin Role Access Review
title: Review and Limit Cluster Admin Role Bindings
description: This control examines the role bindings within the RBAC configuration
  to ensure that the 'cluster-admin' role is only assigned to trusted and necessary
  users or service accounts. Proper validation involves checking that role bindings
  granting 'cluster-admin' privileges are limited and justified. By restricting this
  powerful role's access, the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized actions
  within the cluster is minimized.
rationale: Misconfigured admin role bindings can lead to unauthorized personnel gaining
  full control over the cluster, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data
  breaches, or service disruptions. Attackers could exploit excessive permissions
  to alter configurations, deploy malicious workloads, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
