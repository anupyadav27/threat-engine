service: rbac
resource: default
requirement: Service Account Audit
title: Audit Default Service Account Usage
description: This control checks that audit logging is enabled for the use of the
  default service account in Kubernetes. A well-configured audit log tracks access
  to resources and helps detect unauthorized access attempts. Ensuring that the default
  service account is audited helps maintain visibility over actions performed within
  the cluster, aiding in the early detection of potential security breaches.
rationale: If the default service account is not audited, it could lead to unauthorized
  access and privilege escalation within the cluster. Attackers can exploit the default
  service account to perform lateral movements or escalate privileges, thereby compromising
  cluster security.
