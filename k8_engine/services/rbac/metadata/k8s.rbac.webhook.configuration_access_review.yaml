rule_id: k8s.rbac.webhook.configuration_access_review
service: rbac
resource: webhook
requirement: Configuration Access Review
title: Enforce RBAC Webhook Access Review for Configuration Changes
description: This rule validates that the Kubernetes RBAC webhook is configured to
  perform access reviews of any configuration changes. A proper review involves checking
  that only authorized entities have permissions for key operations like creating,
  modifying, or deleting critical resources. Correct configuration helps in ensuring
  that access controls are strictly enforced, which minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  access and supports compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: If the RBAC webhook configuration is not properly reviewed, it may lead
  to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster. Attackers
  could exploit misconfigured RBAC settings to gain elevated privileges, execute arbitrary
  code, or access sensitive data, compromising the entire cluster's security.
