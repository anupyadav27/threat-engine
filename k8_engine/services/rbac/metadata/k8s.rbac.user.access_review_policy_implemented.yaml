requirement: Access Review Policy Implemented
title: Implement RBAC User Access Review Policies
description: This control checks whether Kubernetes RBAC users have access review
  policies in place, ensuring that user permissions are regularly audited and updated
  as needed. A proper configuration involves defining policies that mandate periodic
  reviews of user permissions, removing unnecessary privileges, and adhering to the
  principle of least privilege. This reduces the attack surface by ensuring only necessary
  permissions are granted, thus mitigating risks associated with privilege misuse.
rationale: Without periodic access reviews, users may retain permissions they no longer
  need, leading to potential security risks such as privilege escalation and unauthorized
  data access. Attackers could exploit stale or excessive permissions to gain access
  to sensitive resources.
