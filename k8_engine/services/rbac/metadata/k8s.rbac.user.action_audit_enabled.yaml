requirement: Action Audit Enabled
title: Enable Audit Logging for RBAC User Actions
description: This check ensures that audit logging is enabled for actions performed
  by RBAC users. It verifies that the audit policy configuration captures all critical
  operations performed by users with RBAC roles. Properly configured audit logging
  allows for the detection and investigation of suspicious activities, thereby enhancing
  security monitoring and ensuring compliance with industry standards like the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without enabling audit logging for RBAC user actions, malicious activities
  such as privilege escalation and unauthorized access may go undetected. This could
  lead to data breaches or unauthorized resource manipulation, compromising the integrity
  and availability of the Kubernetes cluster.
