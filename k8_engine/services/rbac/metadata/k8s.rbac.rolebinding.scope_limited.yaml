resource: rolebinding
requirement: Scope Limited
title: Limit RoleBinding Scope to Minimize Access
description: This control checks that RoleBindings in Kubernetes are limited in scope
  to only the necessary namespaces or resources. A well-configured RoleBinding restricts
  permissions to the minimal required level for users or service accounts, adhering
  to the principle of least privilege. This practice helps in preventing privilege
  escalation attacks and ensures compliance with industry best practices and regulatory
  standards.
rationale: If RoleBindings are not properly scoped, they can grant excessive permissions
  to users or service accounts, increasing the risk of privilege escalation. This
  can lead to unauthorized access to resources within the cluster, compromise of sensitive
  data, or disruption of services. By limiting the scope of RoleBindings, you reduce
  the attack surface and help prevent these security threats.
