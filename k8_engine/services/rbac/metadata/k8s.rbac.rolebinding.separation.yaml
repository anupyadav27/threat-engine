resource: rolebinding
requirement: Separation
title: Enforce RoleBinding Separation for Least Privilege
description: This rule checks that RoleBindings in Kubernetes are configured to enforce
  the principle of least privilege by ensuring that each RoleBinding is associated
  with a specific role and user/group, without overlap that could lead to privilege
  escalation. Proper configuration involves assigning only the necessary permissions
  required for a user or service account to perform its intended function, thereby
  reducing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing security compliance with
  industry standards.
rationale: Improper separation of RoleBindings can lead to privilege escalation attacks,
  where users gain unauthorized access to resources by exploiting overly permissive
  roles. Ensuring strict RoleBinding separation minimizes the attack surface and helps
  prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources, maintaining a secure environment.
