requirement: Anonymous Access
title: Disable Anonymous Access in Kubernetes RBAC
description: This control checks if Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is
  configured to block anonymous access. A secure configuration should ensure that
  no permissions are granted to the 'system:anonymous' user. By disabling anonymous
  access, you reduce the attack surface and enforce authentication, ensuring that
  only authenticated users can interact with the cluster. This helps prevent unauthorized
  access and aligns with security best practices.
rationale: Allowing anonymous access in Kubernetes can lead to unauthorized users
  gaining access to cluster resources. This can be exploited by attackers to escalate
  privileges, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services. Disabling anonymous access is
  crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
