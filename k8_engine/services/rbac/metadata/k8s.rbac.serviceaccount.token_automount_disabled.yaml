rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.token_automount_disabled
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Token Automount Disabled
title: Disable ServiceAccount Token Automount by Default
description: This rule checks that the 'automountServiceAccountToken' field is explicitly
  set to 'false' in the ServiceAccount configuration. By disabling automatic token
  mounting, you limit the exposure of ServiceAccount credentials, thereby reducing
  the risk of unauthorized API access. This setting ensures that ServiceAccount tokens
  are only mounted when absolutely necessary, aligning with the principle of least
  privilege and minimizing the attack surface.
rationale: If ServiceAccount tokens are automatically mounted, they can be inadvertently
  exposed, leading to potential unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API. This exposure
  can be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access
  to sensitive resources within the cluster.
