resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Review Enabled
title: Ensure ServiceAccount Reviews for RBAC Compliance
description: This control checks that all ServiceAccounts and their associated roles
  are regularly reviewed and aligned with the principle of least privilege. The review
  ensures that ServiceAccounts do not possess excessive permissions and are only granted
  the necessary access required for their function. Properly configured reviews help
  mitigate the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access by ensuring that
  permissions are continuously aligned with current operational needs and security
  policies.
rationale: Without regular reviews of ServiceAccount permissions, there is a risk
  of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources. Attackers
  may exploit overly permissive roles associated with ServiceAccounts to perform lateral
  movements and access sensitive data or disrupt services.
