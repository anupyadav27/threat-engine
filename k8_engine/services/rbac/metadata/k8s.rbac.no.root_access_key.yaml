resource: 'no'
requirement: Root Access Key
title: Prohibit Cluster-Wide Privileges for Service Accounts
description: This control checks that no Kubernetes service accounts are granted cluster-wide
  privileges, specifically avoiding the use of any role or role binding that provides
  root-level access. A secure configuration ensures that service accounts are only
  granted the minimum permissions necessary for their function, following the principle
  of least privilege. By restricting excessive permissions, this control helps mitigate
  potential attack vectors such as privilege escalation and unauthorized resource
  access, thereby protecting the cluster's integrity and confidentiality.
rationale: Allowing service accounts to have cluster-wide privileges, especially with
  root access, poses a significant security risk. Misconfigured RBAC roles can lead
  to privilege escalation, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions across
  the entire cluster. This can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and compliance
  violations, as attackers could gain control over critical resources or data.
