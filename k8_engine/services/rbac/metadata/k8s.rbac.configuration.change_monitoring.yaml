requirement: Change Monitoring
title: Monitor RBAC Configuration Changes for Unauthorized Access
description: This control checks that any changes to RBAC configurations, such as
  roles, role bindings, cluster roles, and cluster role bindings, are actively monitored
  and logged. A well-configured monitoring system alerts administrators to unauthorized
  or suspicious changes, helping to quickly identify and mitigate potential security
  threats. Proper monitoring ensures that only authorized changes are made, maintaining
  the integrity of access controls and compliance with security policies.
rationale: If RBAC configuration changes are not monitored, attackers could alter
  permissions to gain unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources. This lack of oversight
  can lead to privilege escalation and potential data breaches, as adversaries could
  modify roles and bindings without detection.
