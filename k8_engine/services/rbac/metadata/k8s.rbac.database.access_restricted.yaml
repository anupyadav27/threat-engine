rule_id: k8s.rbac.database.access_restricted
service: rbac
resource: database
requirement: Access Restricted
title: Enforce RBAC Policies for Database Access
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is
  configured to strictly limit access to database resources only to authorized roles
  and service accounts. A well-configured RBAC policy ensures that only users with
  a legitimate need can access or modify database resources, effectively reducing
  the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access in compliance with security
  best practices and regulations.
rationale: Without strict RBAC policies, unauthorized users or services could gain
  access to sensitive database resources, potentially leading to data breaches or
  unauthorized data manipulation. Attack vectors include privilege escalation and
  lateral movement within the cluster, which can compromise sensitive information
  and disrupt services.
