rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.scope_limited
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Scope Limited
title: Limit Service Account Permissions via RBAC
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes RBAC configurations for service accounts
  are scoped to the minimum necessary permissions. It ensures that each service account
  is only granted access to the resources it needs to function, as defined by specific
  roles and role bindings. By adhering to this configuration, the security posture
  of the cluster is strengthened, as it mitigates the risk of privilege escalation
  and reduces the potential impact of compromised credentials.
rationale: If service accounts are granted excessive permissions, it increases the
  risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized actions within the cluster. Attackers
  could exploit overly permissive roles to access sensitive resources or disrupt workloads.
  Minimizing service account privileges restricts potential attack vectors and aligns
  with the principle of least privilege.
