service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Usage Audited
title: Audit ServiceAccount Usage for Security Compliance
description: This control checks whether the usage of ServiceAccounts is being audited
  effectively. It verifies that audit logs capture all ServiceAccount activities,
  including creation, modification, and usage of associated credentials. A properly
  configured audit system helps identify security anomalies and unauthorized access
  attempts, thereby mitigating potential security risks and ensuring compliance with
  regulations like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to audit ServiceAccount usage can lead to undetected unauthorized
  access and privilege escalation, allowing attackers to exploit elevated permissions
  and compromise the cluster's security. This is critical for identifying misuse and
  ensuring only intended actions are performed by ServiceAccounts.
