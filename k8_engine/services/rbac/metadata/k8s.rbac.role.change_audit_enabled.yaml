resource: role
requirement: Change Audit Enabled
title: Enable RBAC Role Change Auditing
description: This rule checks that auditing is enabled for changes made to Kubernetes
  RBAC roles. Proper auditing ensures that any modification to roles is logged, allowing
  administrators to track and respond to unauthorized attempts to alter permissions.
  A good configuration involves setting up an audit policy that captures 'create',
  'update', and 'delete' events for RBAC resources. This helps in maintaining a secure
  and compliant environment by providing visibility into access control changes.
rationale: Without auditing RBAC role changes, unauthorized modifications might go
  undetected, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data breaches. Attackers
  could exploit unmonitored changes to gain elevated access or disrupt cluster operations.
