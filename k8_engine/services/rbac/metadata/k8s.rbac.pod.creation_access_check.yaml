resource: pod
requirement: Creation Access Check
title: Enforce Pod Creation Permissions via RBAC
description: This control verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies
  are configured to restrict pod creation to authorized users only. It checks whether
  roles and role bindings are properly set up to delegate pod creation permissions
  explicitly. A secure configuration ensures that only users or service accounts with
  a legitimate need can create pods, helping to prevent unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and unintentional resource consumption.
rationale: Without proper RBAC controls, unauthorized users can create pods, potentially
  leading to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or resource exhaustion attacks.
  By restricting pod creation permissions, you minimize the attack surface and ensure
  that only trusted and authenticated entities can deploy workloads.
