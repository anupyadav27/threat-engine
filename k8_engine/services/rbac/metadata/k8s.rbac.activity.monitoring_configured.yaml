resource: activity
requirement: Monitoring Configured
title: Ensure RBAC Activity Monitoring is Enabled
description: This control checks that monitoring for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
  activities is configured according to best practices. It ensures that all access
  and permission changes within the Kubernetes cluster are logged and monitored. This
  includes tracking user and service account actions to detect anomalies such as unauthorized
  access attempts or privilege escalations. Properly configured monitoring helps in
  maintaining compliance with security standards and provides an audit trail for incident
  investigation.
rationale: Without proper monitoring of RBAC activities, unauthorized access attempts
  or privilege escalations may go undetected. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  to gain elevated permissions, compromising cluster integrity and confidentiality.
  Effective monitoring provides visibility into access patterns and potential security
  incidents, allowing timely response to threats.
