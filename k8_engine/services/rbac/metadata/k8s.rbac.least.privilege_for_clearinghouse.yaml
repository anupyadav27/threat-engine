service: rbac
resource: least
requirement: Privilege For Clearinghouse
title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Clearinghouse
description: This control verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is configured
  to grant the minimum required privileges necessary for data clearinghouse operations.
  It ensures that roles and bindings are strictly defined to prevent over-permissioning.
  By limiting access, it minimizes the attack surface and helps maintain compliance
  with security standards, thereby protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
rationale: Misconfigured RBAC permissions can lead to excessive access rights, increasing
  the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Attackers can
  exploit overly permissive roles to escalate privileges or exfiltrate sensitive information
  from the clearinghouse, jeopardizing compliance with regulations like HIPAA.
