rule_id: k8s.rbac.persistentvolume.creation_access_check
service: rbac
resource: persistentvolume
requirement: Creation Access Check
title: Restrict PersistentVolume Creation with RBAC
description: This rule checks that RBAC policies are configured to restrict who can
  create PersistentVolumes. A secure configuration ensures only authorized users or
  service accounts with legitimate need can define PersistentVolumes, reducing the
  risk of unauthorized data exposure or resource consumption. A good configuration
  involves assigning create permissions to a minimal set of roles, typically limited
  to cluster administrators or specific service accounts required by trusted applications,
  ensuring compliance with least privilege principles.
rationale: If RBAC permissions for PersistentVolume creation are not properly restricted,
  unauthorized users may create volumes that could lead to data exfiltration or unauthorized
  data access. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to create PersistentVolumes
  with sensitive data deliberately exposed or to consume excessive storage resources,
  impacting the cluster's availability and performance.
