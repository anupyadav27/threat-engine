resource: inactive
requirement: User Cleanup
title: Regularly Remove Inactive Kubernetes RBAC Users
description: This control checks for the presence of inactive users in the Kubernetes
  RBAC system and ensures they are removed according to best practices. An inactive
  user is defined as an account that has not been used for a specified period. Regular
  cleanup of such users reduces the attack surface, minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  access, and helps maintain compliance with security standards. A good configuration
  involves setting policies for automatic deactivation and removal of unused accounts
  after a certain period of inactivity.
rationale: Inactive RBAC users can become a security liability if they are not removed,
  as their credentials may be exploited by malicious actors. Attackers could potentially
  gain unauthorized access and perform actions within the cluster if old accounts
  are compromised, leading to data breaches or disruption of services.
