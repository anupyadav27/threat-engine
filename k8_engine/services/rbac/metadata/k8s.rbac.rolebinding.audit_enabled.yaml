rule_id: k8s.rbac.rolebinding.audit_enabled
service: rbac
resource: rolebinding
requirement: Audit Enabled
title: Enable Audit Logging for RBAC RoleBindings
description: This rule checks that audit logging is enabled for RBAC RoleBindings
  in Kubernetes. Audit logging captures detailed records of access and modification
  events related to RoleBindings, providing visibility into who accessed or changed
  permissions. Proper audit configuration ensures that any unauthorized or suspicious
  activity is logged for further analysis, aiding in incident response and forensic
  investigations. A good configuration logs all events related to RoleBindings, including
  creation, updates, and deletions, ensuring compliance with security standards and
  regulations.
rationale: Without audit logging, unauthorized changes to RBAC RoleBindings may go
  undetected, potentially allowing privilege escalation or unauthorized access to
  sensitive resources. Attackers could exploit these misconfigurations to escalate
  their permissions or access restricted data, leading to data breaches or disruption
  of services.
