requirement: Review Scheduled
title: Regularly Audit Kubernetes RBAC Role Configurations
description: This control ensures that all Kubernetes RBAC roles are subject to regular
  audits to verify adherence to the principle of least privilege. It checks for the
  existence of a scheduled review process for role configuration changes, ensuring
  that roles are not overly permissive and are periodically validated against current
  security policies. This practice helps to identify and mitigate potential security
  risks by ensuring that roles align with organizational security standards and regulatory
  requirements.
rationale: Failure to regularly review and audit Kubernetes RBAC roles can lead to
  privilege escalation, unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. Attackers
  can exploit overly permissive roles or stale configurations to gain access to sensitive
  resources.
