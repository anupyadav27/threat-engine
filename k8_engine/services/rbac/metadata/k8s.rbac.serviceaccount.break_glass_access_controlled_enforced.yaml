service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Break Glass Access Controlled Enforced
title: Restrict Break Glass ServiceAccount Access with RBAC
description: This rule ensures that any 'break glass' service accounts used for emergency
  access are tightly controlled and auditable. It checks that such service accounts
  have constrained permissions, are used only when absolutely necessary, and access
  is logged. A good configuration restricts these accounts to minimal privileges and
  employs role-based access control (RBAC) policies for fine-grained access management.
  This minimizes the risk of privilege escalation and helps maintain a secure environment.
rationale: Improperly configured break glass access can lead to unauthorized elevation
  of privileges and potential compromise of the Kubernetes cluster. Attackers exploiting
  this can gain administrative access, bypassing normal security controls and causing
  disruption or data exfiltration.
