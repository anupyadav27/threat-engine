resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Unique Serviceaccount Enforced
title: Ensure Each Pod Uses a Unique ServiceAccount
description: This control checks that each Kubernetes pod is associated with a unique
  service account, rather than using the default service account or sharing one among
  multiple pods. A unique service account should have the minimum necessary permissions
  for its associated pod, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Implementing
  this control helps contain potential security breaches, ensuring that a compromised
  pod cannot affect others by leveraging shared credentials or excessive permissions.
rationale: Using a unique service account for each pod mitigates the risk of privilege
  escalation and minimizes the attack surface. If a service account is shared among
  multiple pods, a compromise of one pod can lead to unauthorized access across others,
  potentially allowing attackers to escalate privileges and access sensitive data
  or resources within the cluster.
