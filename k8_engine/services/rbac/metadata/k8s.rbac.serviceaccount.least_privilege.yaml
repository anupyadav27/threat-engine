rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.least_privilege
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Least Privilege
title: Ensure ServiceAccounts Use Minimal RBAC Permissions
description: This control checks that each ServiceAccount in the Kubernetes cluster
  is assigned only the permissions necessary to perform its intended functions, following
  the principle of least privilege. A properly configured ServiceAccount should have
  RBAC roles and role bindings that limit its access to only the resources it needs
  to interact with. This reduces potential attack surfaces and helps in maintaining
  a secure environment by preventing privilege escalation and data breaches.
rationale: Misconfigured RBAC permissions for ServiceAccounts can lead to excessive
  privileges, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
  Attackers exploiting this can execute commands or access sensitive data within the
  cluster, posing significant security threats.
