requirement: Cert Auto Rotation Enabled
title: Enable Automatic Rotation of Service Account Tokens
description: This control checks that service accounts are configured to automatically
  rotate their tokens, ensuring that credentials are regularly refreshed. A good configuration
  involves setting the 'BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume' feature gate and ensuring
  that service account tokens have a defined, limited lifespan. This practice reduces
  the duration of potential misuse in case of token leakage and aligns with the principle
  of least privilege by minimizing the attack surface.
rationale: Failure to enable automatic rotation of service account tokens can lead
  to prolonged exposure of credentials, increasing the risk of unauthorized access
  if a token is compromised. Without rotation, tokens remain valid indefinitely, providing
  persistent access to attackers who may exploit them to escalate privileges or access
  sensitive resources.
