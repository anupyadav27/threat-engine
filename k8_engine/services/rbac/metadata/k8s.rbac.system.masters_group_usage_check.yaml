rule_id: k8s.rbac.system.masters_group_usage_check
service: rbac
resource: system
requirement: Masters Group Usage Check
title: Restrict Access to 'system:masters' RBAC Group
description: This control checks that only authorized users and service accounts are
  members of the 'system:masters' group, which inherently has cluster-admin privileges.
  A secure configuration ensures that access is limited to trusted administrators,
  minimizing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized cluster modifications.
  This is aligned with the principle of least privilege and helps comply with security
  standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If improperly configured, the 'system:masters' group can grant administrative
  privileges to unauthorized users, leading to potential full control over the Kubernetes
  cluster. This could be exploited to escalate privileges, modify cluster state, or
  access sensitive data.
