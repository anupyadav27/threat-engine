requirement: No Wildcard In Rules
title: Enforce Specific Resource Permissions in RBAC Roles
description: This control checks that no Kubernetes RBAC roles use wildcards ('*')
  in their rules, ensuring that permissions are explicitly defined for specific resources
  and actions. A properly configured RBAC role should list each resource and verb
  separately, avoiding broad permissions that could be abused. By adhering to this
  practice, organizations can limit permissions to only what is necessary for operations,
  thus enhancing security and maintaining compliance with industry standards such
  as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Using wildcards in RBAC role permissions can lead to excessive privilege
  allocation, increasing the risk of privilege escalation attacks. Attackers could
  exploit these broad permissions to gain unauthorized access to resources, potentially
  compromising the entire cluster. By enforcing specific resource permissions, the
  principle of least privilege is upheld, minimizing the attack surface and reducing
  the likelihood of unauthorized actions.
