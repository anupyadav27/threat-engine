rule_id: k8s.rbac.inactive.service_account_disabled
service: rbac
resource: inactive
requirement: Service Account Disabled
title: Disable Unused Service Accounts
description: This rule checks for service accounts that have not been used for a specified
  period and ensures they are disabled. A well-configured system will identify inactive
  service accounts and disable or delete them to reduce the attack surface. By doing
  so, it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and aligns with security best practices,
  thereby enhancing overall cluster security.
rationale: Inactive service accounts in Kubernetes pose a security risk as they can
  be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to resources. These accounts
  may retain permissions that are no longer necessary, providing potential attack
  vectors for privilege escalation and lateral movement within the cluster.
