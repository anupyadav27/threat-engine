service: rbac
resource: role
requirement: Least Privilege Enforced
title: Enforce RBAC Roles with Least Privilege
description: This control checks that RBAC roles are configured to grant the minimal
  set of permissions necessary for their intended function. A good configuration ensures
  that roles do not have unnecessary access to resources, adhering strictly to the
  principle of least privilege. This reduces the attack surface and mitigates risks
  associated with overly permissive roles, thus enhancing the cluster's security posture.
rationale: Misconfigured RBAC roles with excessive permissions increase the risk of
  privilege escalation and unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources. Attackers
  exploiting these roles can perform malicious actions, such as data exfiltration
  or service disruption, compromising the entire cluster's security.
