requirement: Access Restricted
title: Restrict Access to Kubernetes Audit Logs via RBAC
description: This rule checks that RBAC policies are configured to restrict access
  to Kubernetes audit logs. A secure configuration ensures that only authorized users
  and service accounts can view or modify audit logs. This practice helps prevent
  unauthorized access and tampering, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive audit information. Proper RBAC configuration mitigates risks such as
  privilege escalation and unauthorized access, aligning with security benchmarks
  and compliance requirements. Specific configurations should deny 'get', 'watch',
  and 'list' permissions on audit logs to users who do not need them.
rationale: If unauthorized users gain access to Kubernetes audit logs, they can gain
  insights into the cluster's operations and exploit this information to target potential
  vulnerabilities. Misconfiguration of RBAC policies can lead to privilege escalation
  or unauthorized data exposure, making it crucial to restrict log access to only
  those who require it for their roles.
