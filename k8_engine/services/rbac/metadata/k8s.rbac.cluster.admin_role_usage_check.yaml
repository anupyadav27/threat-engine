service: rbac
resource: cluster
requirement: Admin Role Usage Check
title: Restrict Cluster Admin Role Usage
description: This control checks for the excessive assignment of the Cluster Admin
  role across the cluster. A proper configuration should ensure that only a minimal
  number of trusted entities have this role, and their access is regularly audited.
  This helps enforce the principle of least privilege, curbing potential lateral movement
  by attackers who gain access to compromised credentials.
rationale: If the Cluster Admin role is misconfigured or overused, it can lead to
  unauthorized access and privilege escalation, allowing attackers to compromise the
  entire cluster. Limiting its usage reduces the attack surface and mitigates risks
  associated with excessive permissions.
