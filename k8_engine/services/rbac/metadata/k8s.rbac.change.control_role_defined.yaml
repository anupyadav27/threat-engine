resource: change
requirement: Control Role Defined
title: Ensure RBAC Roles are Defined for Change Management
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  roles involved in change management are explicitly defined and configured according
  to security best practices. A well-structured RBAC policy ensures that only authorized
  users or service accounts can perform actions that modify critical resources, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized changes. Properly managing RBAC roles is essential to enforce
  the principle of least privilege and maintain a secure Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Improperly configured or undefined RBAC roles can lead to unauthorized
  access, allowing malicious actors to modify critical resources within the Kubernetes
  cluster. This could result in privilege escalation or unauthorized data access,
  compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
