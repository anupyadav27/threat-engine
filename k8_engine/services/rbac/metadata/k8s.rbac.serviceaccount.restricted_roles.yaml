rule_id: k8s.rbac.serviceaccount.restricted_roles
service: rbac
resource: serviceaccount
requirement: Restricted Roles
title: Restrict ServiceAccount Bindings to Privileged Roles
description: This rule checks that ServiceAccounts are not bound to overly privileged
  roles, such as those granting cluster-admin or equivalent permissions. A secure
  configuration restricts ServiceAccounts to the minimum necessary permissions, adhering
  to the principle of least privilege. By ensuring appropriate role bindings, the
  risk of accidental or malicious privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster
  is significantly reduced.
rationale: Misconfigured ServiceAccount bindings to privileged roles can lead to privilege
  escalation, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive resources or operations. Attackers
  can exploit these excessive permissions to execute malicious actions within the
  cluster, leading to potential data breaches and service disruptions.
