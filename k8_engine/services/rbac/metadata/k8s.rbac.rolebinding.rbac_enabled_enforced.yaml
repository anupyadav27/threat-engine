service: rbac
resource: rolebinding
requirement: Rbac Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce RoleBinding with RBAC for Access Control
description: This rule checks that RoleBindings in the Kubernetes cluster are properly
  configured to enforce RBAC policies. It ensures that each RoleBinding is linked
  to appropriate Roles or ClusterRoles and that permissions granted are minimal and
  necessary for the function. Proper enforcement prevents unauthorized access by ensuring
  only authenticated and authorized users or service accounts can perform actions
  defined by their roles, thereby reducing the attack surface and mitigating the risk
  of privilege escalation.
rationale: Without proper enforcement of RoleBindings in RBAC, users or service accounts
  may gain unintended permissions, leading to potential privilege escalation or unauthorized
  access to cluster resources. This misconfiguration can expose sensitive data and
  increase the risk of insider threats or compromised accounts accessing critical
  resources.
