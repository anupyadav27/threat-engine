title: Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Separation of Duties
description: This control checks that Kubernetes RBAC roles are configured to enforce
  separation of duties by ensuring that permissions are appropriately distributed
  among different roles. It verifies that no single role has excessive access that
  violates the principle of least privilege. Proper configuration involves assigning
  specific permissions to users based on their job functions, thereby minimizing the
  risk of unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security best practices
  and regulatory standards.
rationale: Without proper separation of duties, a single user might have excessive
  permissions, increasing the risk of insider threats or accidental misuse of privileges.
  This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, or service
  disruptions.
