rule_id: k8s.rbac.policies.documented
service: rbac
resource: policies
requirement: Documented
title: Ensure RBAC Policies Are Fully Documented and Reviewed
description: This rule checks that all RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies within
  the Kubernetes cluster are documented with clear descriptions of their purpose and
  scope. Proper documentation includes details about the roles, bindings, and permissions
  granted, ensuring they align with the principle of least privilege. This practice
  helps in regular audits, simplifying the identification of over-permissive roles
  and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
rationale: Undocumented or poorly documented RBAC policies can lead to misconfigurations,
  where excessive permissions may be granted. This increases the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access to cluster resources, which are common attack
  vectors for malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the cluster.
