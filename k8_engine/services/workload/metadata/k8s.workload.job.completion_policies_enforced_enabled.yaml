title: Enforce Job Completion Policies in Kubernetes Workloads
description: This control checks that Kubernetes jobs have completion policies properly
  configured, such as 'completions', 'parallelism', and 'activeDeadlineSeconds'. A
  well-configured job ensures that resources are utilized efficiently and prevents
  jobs from running indefinitely, which helps mitigate risks associated with resource
  exhaustion and potential service disruptions. Enforcing these policies also aligns
  with security best practices and helps comply with standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without enforced job completion policies, Kubernetes jobs may run indefinitely
  or restart more times than necessary, consuming resources and potentially leading
  to denial-of-service conditions. Misconfigured policies could also allow unauthorized
  users to exploit jobs for resource exhaustion attacks.
