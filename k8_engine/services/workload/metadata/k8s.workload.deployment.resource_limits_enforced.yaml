requirement: Resource Limits Enforced
title: Enforce Resource Limits on Deployments
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes Deployment configurations specify
  resource limits for CPU and memory. Proper resource limit configurations ensure
  that each pod is only able to consume a predetermined amount of resources, preventing
  excessive resource usage that could lead to performance degradation or denial-of-service
  conditions. By enforcing these limits, clusters maintain stability and ensure fair
  resource distribution among workloads, thereby enhancing security posture and operational
  reliability.
rationale: Without resource limits, a single pod can monopolize cluster resources,
  leading to denial-of-service conditions by exhausting CPU and memory. Resource limits
  also protect against accidental or malicious overconsumption of resources, which
  can degrade the performance and stability of other workloads and the cluster as
  a whole.
