rule_id: k8s.workload.cronjob.execution_constraints_enforced
service: workload
resource: cronjob
requirement: Execution Constraints Enforced
title: Enforce Resource Limits on CronJobs
description: This rule verifies that all CronJobs have defined resource requests and
  limits for CPU and memory. Properly enforcing these constraints ensures that CronJobs
  do not monopolize resources, potentially disrupting other workloads. It also helps
  prevent potential denial-of-service attacks by limiting the resources an attacker
  can consume if they gain control over a CronJob.
rationale: Without resource limits, CronJobs can consume excessive CPU or memory,
  leading to resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. This misconfiguration
  can be exploited by attackers to impact the availability of the cluster.
