requirement: Service Mesh Cert Auth Enforced
title: Enforce Service Mesh Certificate Authentication for Service Accounts
description: This control checks whether Kubernetes workload service accounts have
  service mesh certificate authentication enforced. A proper configuration ensures
  that only authenticated and authorized workloads communicate within the service
  mesh, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Enforcing this
  policy helps maintain secure communication channels and aligns with security best
  practices for identity and access management within a Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: If service mesh certificate authentication is not enforced, workloads may
  authenticate without proper security measures, increasing the risk of impersonation
  attacks. Attackers could potentially exploit this to gain unauthorized access to
  services and sensitive data within the cluster.
