requirement: Persistence Secured Enforced
title: Ensure StatefulSet PVCs Are Properly Secured
description: This control checks that Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) associated with
  StatefulSets are configured with appropriate access modes and storage class policies
  to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. It validates that PVCs are not given
  excessive permissions, such as unrestricted ReadWriteMany access, unless absolutely
  necessary. Properly configured PVCs mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches.
rationale: Improperly secured persistent volumes in StatefulSets can lead to unauthorized
  data access or data loss. Attackers may exploit misconfigurations to gain access
  to sensitive data or disrupt application functionality by manipulating stored data.
