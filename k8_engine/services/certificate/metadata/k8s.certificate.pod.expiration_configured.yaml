resource: pod
requirement: Expiration Configured
title: Ensure Pod Certificate Expiration Is Configured
description: This control checks that certificates used by Kubernetes pods have an
  expiration date set, ensuring that these credentials are not valid indefinitely.
  Proper configuration involves setting a reasonable expiration period that balances
  operational requirements with security. By enforcing certificate expiration, organizations
  can automatically rotate credentials, reducing the risk of credential exposure and
  ensuring that any compromised credentials have a limited lifespan. This approach
  aligns with best practices such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, which recommend
  regular certificate renewal to maintain security posture.
rationale: Configuring certificate expiration for pod communications is crucial as
  it limits the lifespan of credentials. Without expiration, certificates can be exploited
  indefinitely if compromised, allowing attackers to maintain unauthorized access
  to cluster resources. This misconfiguration increases the risk of man-in-the-middle
  attacks and data breaches.
