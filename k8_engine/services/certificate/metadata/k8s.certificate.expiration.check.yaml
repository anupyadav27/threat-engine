title: Ensure Timely Renewal of Kubernetes Certificates
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes certificates are configured to
  be monitored for expiration and timely renewal. It validates that automated processes
  are in place to renew certificates before they expire. A well-configured certificate
  management system reduces the risk of service disruptions and unauthorized access,
  thereby enhancing security posture and ensuring compliance with industry standards
  like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Expired Kubernetes certificates can lead to service outages and security
  vulnerabilities, as they are no longer valid for authenticating entities within
  the cluster. Attackers may exploit expired certificates to intercept or manipulate
  traffic, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. Ensuring
  certificates are renewed before expiration mitigates these risks and maintains a
  secure and functional cluster environment.
