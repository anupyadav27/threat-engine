rule_id: k8s.image.pull.policy_always
service: image
resource: pull
requirement: Policy Always
title: Enforce ImagePullPolicy Always for Immutable Deployments
description: This rule checks that all Kubernetes Pods have their imagePullPolicy
  set to 'Always'. A valid configuration ensures that every Pod startup retrieves
  the most recent image from the registry, bypassing any local cache. This practice
  protects against running deprecated or potentially vulnerable images and complies
  with security best practices. By enforcing this policy, administrators ensure that
  only the most current, vetted images are deployed, thereby enhancing the overall
  security posture.
rationale: Using an 'Always' image pull policy mitigates the risk of running outdated
  or compromised images by ensuring that the latest version of an image is always
  retrieved from the registry. This is crucial to prevent the exploitation of known
  vulnerabilities that might exist in cached images, reducing the attack surface in
  Kubernetes clusters. Attack vectors include the execution of vulnerable, outdated
  images that might allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
