requirement: Container Scanning Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Automated Container Image Vulnerability Scanning
description: This control checks that all container images deployed in Kubernetes
  pods are subject to automated vulnerability scanning. A good configuration ensures
  that only images that have been scanned and deemed free of critical vulnerabilities
  are allowed to run. This process helps in identifying security flaws early, preventing
  the use of compromised images, and maintaining compliance with security standards.
  Practically, this can be enforced using admission controllers such as Open Policy
  Agent or specific tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
rationale: Without enforced container image scanning, vulnerabilities within images
  can go undetected, leading to potential exploits such as privilege escalation or
  data breaches. Attackers can leverage known vulnerabilities in containers to gain
  unauthorized access or cause denial of service, threatening the security posture
  of the Kubernetes cluster.
