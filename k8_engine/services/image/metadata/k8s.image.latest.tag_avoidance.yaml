resource: latest
requirement: Tag Avoidance
title: Avoid Using 'latest' Tag for Container Images
description: This rule checks that container images do not use the 'latest' tag, which
  can be mutable and lead to non-deterministic deployments. Best practices dictate
  specifying explicit version tags to ensure that the exact tested and verified image
  is deployed, thus minimizing security risks associated with unexpected changes.
  Ensuring that images are versioned helps maintain consistency, traceability, and
  auditability, reducing the risk of deploying unverified code.
rationale: Using the 'latest' tag for container images poses a security risk as it
  can lead to unpredictable deployments. If an image is pushed with the 'latest' tag,
  it may inadvertently propagate changes to production environments without proper
  testing, leading to potential application instability or introduction of vulnerabilities.
  Attackers could exploit these changes if they introduce unpatched or vulnerable
  software components.
