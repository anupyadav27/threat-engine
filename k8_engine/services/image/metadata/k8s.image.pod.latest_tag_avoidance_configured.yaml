requirement: Latest Tag Avoidance Configured
title: Avoid Using 'latest' Tag for Container Images
description: This control checks that Kubernetes pods do not use the 'latest' tag
  for container images. Best practice is to use specific version tags to ensure that
  the exact same image is used across different environments and deployments. By avoiding
  the 'latest' tag, organizations can ensure a more predictable and secure software
  supply chain, reducing the risk of deploying untested or vulnerable image versions.
  This practice aligns with security best practices and helps maintain a stable and
  secure deployment process.
rationale: Using the 'latest' tag for container images can lead to unpredictable deployments
  and makes it difficult to manage versions and ensure consistency across environments.
  This can introduce security vulnerabilities, as the image tagged 'latest' may change
  unexpectedly, potentially introducing unvetted changes or vulnerabilities. Attackers
  can exploit these inconsistencies to introduce malicious code or exploit newly exposed
  vulnerabilities.
