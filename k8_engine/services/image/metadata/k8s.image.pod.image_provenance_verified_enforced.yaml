requirement: Image Provenance Verified Enforced
title: Enforce Image Provenance Verification in Pods
description: This control checks whether the image provenance verification is enforced
  for all container images used in Kubernetes pods. It ensures that images are sourced
  from trusted registries and have not been tampered with during transit. A good configuration
  involves using admission controllers to automatically verify image signatures before
  allowing pod deployment. By enforcing image provenance, organizations can enhance
  the security of their supply chain, reduce the attack surface, and comply with security
  best practices.
rationale: If image provenance verification is not enforced, there is a risk of deploying
  untrusted or malicious images, which can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  or execution of harmful code. Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in unverified
  images to gain control over Kubernetes resources, leading to potential compromise
  of the entire cluster.
