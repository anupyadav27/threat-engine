resource: latest
requirement: Tag Prohibited
title: Disallow 'latest' Tag in Container Images
description: This rule checks that container images in Kubernetes deployments do not
  use the 'latest' tag. Instead, images should be tagged with specific version numbers.
  By disallowing 'latest', you ensure that deployments use immutable and explicitly
  versioned images, reducing the risk of unexpected changes and making it easier to
  audit and roll back to known good states. This practice enhances security by ensuring
  consistent and predictable deployments, aligning with best practices for secure
  software supply chains.
rationale: Using the 'latest' tag in container images introduces unpredictability
  into the deployment process, as it can lead to unintentional updates that may introduce
  vulnerabilities or break application functionality. Attackers could exploit this
  by introducing malicious changes into container images under the 'latest' tag, leading
  to potential security breaches.
