resource: configmap
requirement: Management Tool Integration Configured
title: Ensure ConfigMap Integration with Configuration Management Tools
description: This control checks whether a Kubernetes ConfigMap is integrated with
  an external configuration management tool, such as Helm or Ansible, ensuring that
  changes to ConfigMaps are tracked, audited, and compliant with security policies.
  Proper integration ensures that ConfigMaps are consistently managed and reduces
  the risk of unauthorized modifications. A well-configured integration allows for
  automated compliance checks and alerts, maintaining the integrity and security of
  the deployment.
rationale: Without proper integration with configuration management tools, ConfigMaps
  may be prone to unauthorized changes or misconfigurations, potentially leading to
  configuration drift, security vulnerabilities, or non-compliance with security policies.
  Attackers may exploit improperly managed ConfigMaps to inject malicious configurations
  or exfiltrate sensitive data.
