resource: configmap
requirement: Baseline Policies Enforced
title: Enforce ConfigMap Baseline Security Policies
description: This control verifies that ConfigMaps adhere to defined baseline security
  policies. It checks for secure access configurations, such as restricting ConfigMap
  access to only necessary namespaces and roles, ensuring that data within ConfigMaps
  is encrypted in transit, and validating that sensitive information is not stored
  in plaintext. Proper enforcement of these policies reduces the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and manipulation, and aligns with industry standards like the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfigured ConfigMaps can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive configuration
  data, potentially exposing the application to security threats such as data leaks,
  unauthorized modifications, and privilege escalation. By ensuring baseline security
  policies are enforced, you can mitigate risks associated with insecure data handling
  and ensure compliance with security best practices.
