resource: baseline
requirement: Policies Applied
title: Enforce ConfigMap Policy Compliance for Security Baselines
description: This rule checks that all ConfigMaps adhere to defined security policies
  that align with best practices for secure configuration management. It ensures that
  any ConfigMap used within the cluster is compliant with established baseline security
  policies, reducing the risk of misconfiguration that could lead to unauthorized
  access. An ideal configuration involves strict access controls and policy validation
  that prevents unapproved changes, thereby maintaining cluster integrity and compliance
  with security frameworks.
rationale: ConfigMaps, if improperly configured, can expose sensitive data and configurations,
  leading to potential unauthorized access or data leakage. Attackers may exploit
  misconfigured ConfigMaps to inject malicious configurations or to gain insights
  into the cluster's operational state, facilitating further attacks.
