title: Integrate Configuration Management Tools with Kubernetes ConfigMaps
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes ConfigMaps are managed and monitored
  using established configuration management tools that enforce best practices and
  security policies. A good configuration should ensure that only authorized tools
  and users can modify ConfigMaps, and all changes are logged and auditable. This
  helps in maintaining a secure environment by preventing unauthorized changes, reducing
  the risk of data leaks, and ensuring compliance with security standards.
rationale: Without proper integration of configuration management tools, there is
  a heightened risk of misconfigurations and unauthorized changes to ConfigMaps. This
  can lead to exposure of sensitive data or service disruptions due to incorrect configurations.
  Attack vectors include unauthorized access and manipulation of ConfigMaps, which
  can lead to privilege escalation or service compromise.
