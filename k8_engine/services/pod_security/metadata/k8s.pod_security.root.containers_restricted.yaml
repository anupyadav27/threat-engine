rule_id: k8s.pod_security.root.containers_restricted
service: pod_security
resource: root
requirement: Containers Restricted
title: Restrict Privileged Container Permissions in Pods
description: This rule checks if pods are configured to prevent running containers
  with privileged permissions. A well-configured Kubernetes environment should ensure
  that the 'privileged' flag in container security contexts is set to 'false', thereby
  restricting containers from accessing host-level resources and kernel capabilities.
  This enhances security by minimizing the attack surface and adhering to the principle
  of least privilege.
rationale: Allowing containers to run with privileged permissions can lead to severe
  security risks. Attackers with access to a privileged container can potentially
  gain control over the host system, escalate privileges, or exploit host resources,
  leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
