resource: pod
requirement: Plane Auto Upgrade Enabled
title: Enable Control Plane's Auto-Upgrades
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes control plane is configured to
  perform automatic upgrades. A control plane that is not set to auto-upgrade may
  miss critical security patches and updates, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities.
  By enabling auto-upgrades, organizations ensure that their control plane is always
  running the latest, most secure version, thus helping to maintain the integrity
  and security of the cluster. Good configuration involves setting the control plane
  to automatically upgrade to the latest stable versions as they become available.
rationale: Without automated upgrades, Kubernetes control planes might run outdated
  versions, exposing clusters to known vulnerabilities and exploits. Attackers can
  leverage these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Ensuring
  that control planes are auto-upgraded reduces the risk of exploitation by keeping
  the environment up-to-date with security patches and improvements.
