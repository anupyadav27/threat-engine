requirement: Apiserver Profiling Disabled
title: Disable Profiling in Kubernetes API Server
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server does not have profiling
  enabled. Profiling can be disabled by setting the `--profiling` flag to `false`
  in the API server configuration. Disabling profiling enhances security by preventing
  unauthorized users from accessing detailed performance data, which could be used
  to infer internal states or identify potential vulnerabilities. Properly configured,
  this setting aligns with security best practices and helps protect the cluster's
  core components from misuse.
rationale: Enabling profiling in the Kubernetes API server can expose sensitive performance
  metrics and debugging information that may be exploited by attackers to gain insights
  into the cluster's operations. This can lead to information leakage or serve as
  a precursor to targeted attacks. Profiling should be disabled to minimize the attack
  surface and protect against unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information.
