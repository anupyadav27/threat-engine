requirement: Recovery Plan Documented
title: Document and Maintain Kubernetes Disaster Recovery Plan
description: This control verifies the existence and regular maintenance of a documented
  disaster recovery plan specific to Kubernetes clusters. A well-documented plan includes
  detailed procedures for backup and restoration, testing protocols, and designated
  roles and responsibilities. This ensures that in the event of a disaster, all team
  members can quickly and effectively restore the cluster to its operational state,
  minimizing downtime and data loss. Proper documentation and regular testing of the
  recovery plan help in adhering to industry standards and regulatory requirements.
rationale: A poorly documented or non-existent disaster recovery plan can lead to
  prolonged downtime and data loss in the event of a catastrophic failure. Attackers
  can exploit such gaps to disrupt operations further or access sensitive data during
  chaotic recovery efforts. Proper documentation ensures quick recovery and mitigates
  the impact of attacks such as ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS).
