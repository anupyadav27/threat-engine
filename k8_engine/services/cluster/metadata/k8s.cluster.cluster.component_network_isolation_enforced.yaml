service: cluster
resource: cluster
requirement: Component Network Isolation Enforced
title: Enforce Network Policies for Component Isolation
description: This rule verifies that network policies are configured to enforce isolation
  between Kubernetes components, ensuring that only specified traffic is allowed.
  Proper network isolation prevents unauthorized communication between pods and services,
  mitigating risks such as data exfiltration and privilege escalation. A well-configured
  network policy will define ingress and egress rules that limit traffic to only what
  is necessary for application functionality, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
rationale: Without network policies, Kubernetes components might inadvertently communicate,
  exposing the cluster to potential lateral movement by attackers. Misconfigured network
  isolation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive components and data, increasing
  the risk of data breaches and denial-of-service attacks.
