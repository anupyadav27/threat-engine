title: Ensure Secrets Are Encrypted at Rest
description: This control checks that Kubernetes Secrets are encrypted at rest using
  a strong encryption mechanism. Proper configuration involves enabling encryption
  providers and configuring encryption keys in the kube-apiserver. Encryption at rest
  ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the etcd database, the secrets
  remain protected. The good configuration involves setting up the EncryptionConfiguration
  file and verifying that the kube-apiserver is correctly referencing it. This not
  only mitigates the risk of data exposure but also aligns with industry best practices
  and compliance requirements.
rationale: If secrets are not encrypted at rest, they are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Attackers who gain access to the etcd database could extract
  sensitive information, leading to potential exposure of confidential data or gaining
  unauthorized access to resources within the cluster.
