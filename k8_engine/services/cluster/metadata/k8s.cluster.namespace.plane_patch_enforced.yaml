service: cluster
resource: namespace
requirement: Plane Patch Enforced
title: Ensure Namespace-Level Security Policies are Up-to-Date
description: This rule checks that all namespaces within the Kubernetes cluster have
  the latest security patches applied to their associated resources, such as network
  policies and RBAC roles. By ensuring namespaces are configured with the latest security
  updates, clusters are protected against known vulnerabilities and unauthorized access
  is minimized. A compliant configuration follows Kubernetes best practices and industry
  standards, reducing the attack surface and aligning with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Outdated or unpatched namespace configurations can expose clusters to vulnerabilities,
  allowing attackers to exploit known security weaknesses. Attack vectors include
  privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or denial of service attacks by exploiting
  unpatched APIs or components.
