title: Ensure Kubernetes Cluster Uses Supported Versions
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes cluster is running a version
  that is actively supported by the Kubernetes community or your cloud provider. Supported
  versions receive security updates and patches, reducing the risk of exploitation
  from known vulnerabilities. A secure configuration ensures that the cluster is protected
  against common threats, adheres to compliance requirements, and benefits from performance
  and feature improvements included in newer releases.
rationale: Using an unsupported Kubernetes version increases the risk of exposure
  to unpatched vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized
  access or disrupt services. Attack vectors include known security flaws that aren't
  addressed after a version goes out of support, potentially leading to data breaches
  or service outages.
