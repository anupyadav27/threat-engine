rule_id: k8s.cluster.backup.and_restore_tested
service: cluster
resource: backup
requirement: And Restore Tested
title: Regularly Test Kubernetes Cluster Backup and Restore Procedures
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes clusters have backup and restore procedures
  that are not only in place but are also regularly tested. A successful configuration
  ensures that all critical data and configurations are recoverable and that the restoration
  process is efficient and reliable. By simulating failure scenarios and validating
  restoration steps, organizations can identify and rectify potential weaknesses in
  their backup strategies, thus bolstering their disaster recovery capabilities and
  compliance with regulatory demands such as HIPAA.
rationale: Failure to regularly test backup and restore procedures can lead to data
  loss and extended downtime during recovery from incidents such as cyber attacks,
  accidental deletions, or system failures. Without verified backup and restore processes,
  clusters are vulnerable to prolonged disruptions, risking data integrity and availability,
  which could be exploited by attackers to cause operational chaos or data breaches.
