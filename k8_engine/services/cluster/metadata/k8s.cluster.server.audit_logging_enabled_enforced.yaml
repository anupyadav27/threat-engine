rule_id: k8s.cluster.server.audit_logging_enabled_enforced
service: cluster
resource: server
requirement: Audit Logging Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Kubernetes Audit Logging on API Server
description: This rule checks that audit logging is enabled and properly configured
  on the Kubernetes API server. A good configuration involves specifying an appropriate
  audit policy file, which dictates which events are logged and at what level of detail.
  Proper audit logging helps in tracking access to the cluster, monitoring administrative
  actions, and maintaining a history of configuration changes, thereby significantly
  enhancing security by facilitating incident detection and response.
rationale: Without audit logging, malicious activities such as privilege escalation
  and unauthorized resource access may go undetected, increasing the risk of data
  breaches. Audit logs provide critical insights into API server activities, enabling
  security teams to detect anomalies and trace unauthorized actions back to their
  source.
