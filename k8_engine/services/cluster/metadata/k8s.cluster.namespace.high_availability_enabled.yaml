requirement: High Availability Enabled
title: Ensure Namespace Quotas and Limits for High Availability
description: This rule checks that each namespace has resource quotas and limit ranges
  configured to ensure high availability of applications within the cluster. A well-defined
  quota and limit range configuration prevents any single namespace from monopolizing
  cluster resources, thus maintaining balance and availability across all applications.
  Proper configuration includes setting CPU, memory, and storage limits which help
  mitigate risks such as resource exhaustion attacks.
rationale: Without properly configured quotas and limits, a namespace can consume
  excessive resources, leading to instability or downtime of critical services. This
  can be exploited by attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) by overloading the
  cluster, affecting its availability and reliability.
