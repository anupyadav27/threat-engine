title: Enable and Configure Kubernetes Cluster Resource Monitoring
description: This control checks that Kubernetes cluster resource monitoring is enabled
  and properly configured according to security best practices. A comprehensive monitoring
  setup includes capturing logs and metrics for resource usage, network activities,
  and access patterns. This facilitates early detection of suspicious activities,
  aids in forensic analysis, and supports compliance with standards such as the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark. A well-configured monitoring system helps in identifying unusual
  patterns that could indicate a security incident, thus enabling proactive threat
  mitigation.
rationale: Without proper monitoring, anomalies and unauthorized activities within
  the Kubernetes cluster might go undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches
  and insider threats. Monitoring is essential for timely detection of threats, auditing
  cluster activities, and ensuring compliance with security policies.
