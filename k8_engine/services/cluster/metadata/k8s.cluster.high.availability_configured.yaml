requirement: Availability Configured
title: Ensure High Availability for Kubernetes Control Plane
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes control plane is configured for
  high availability by ensuring multiple instances of critical components like etcd,
  the API server, controller manager, and scheduler are distributed across different
  nodes. This setup increases resilience against failures and supports continuous
  operation. Proper high availability configuration ensures that the cluster can sustain
  node or component failures without service interruption, thereby maintaining security
  and operational integrity.
rationale: High availability (HA) configurations mitigate the risk of single points
  of failure in the Kubernetes control plane, which could lead to cluster downtime.
  Without HA, a failure in a control plane component could disrupt critical services
  and workloads, potentially exposing the cluster to security vulnerabilities and
  operational risks.
