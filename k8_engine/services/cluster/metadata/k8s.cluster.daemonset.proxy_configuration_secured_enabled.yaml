resource: daemonset
requirement: Proxy Configuration Secured Enabled
title: Ensure Secure Proxy Configuration in DaemonSets
description: This rule checks that all DaemonSets in the Kubernetes cluster have secure
  proxy configurations. It verifies that the proxy settings include encryption and
  authentication mechanisms that comply with security best practices. A secure configuration
  ensures that all communication routed through the proxy is protected against interception
  and tampering, thereby maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data. Properly
  configured proxies also help comply with security standards and benchmarks.
rationale: Improperly configured proxy settings in DaemonSets can expose sensitive
  data and increase the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers could intercept
  or alter traffic, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. Secure proxy
  configuration is essential to ensure data integrity and confidentiality when routing
  traffic through proxies.
