requirement: Up To Date
title: Ensure Kubernetes Cluster Version is Current
description: This control checks if the Kubernetes cluster is running the latest stable
  version or a version that is still supported by the community. Up-to-date versions
  include security patches and improvements, reducing the risk of exploitation through
  known vulnerabilities. A good configuration ensures that the cluster's version is
  not end-of-life and has all critical security updates applied. Regular updates help
  maintain compliance with security benchmarks, such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark,
  and support a robust security posture.
rationale: Running an outdated Kubernetes version can expose clusters to security
  vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases. Attackers may exploit
  known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt
  services. Keeping the cluster version up to date mitigates these risks by incorporating
  the latest security enhancements and patches.
