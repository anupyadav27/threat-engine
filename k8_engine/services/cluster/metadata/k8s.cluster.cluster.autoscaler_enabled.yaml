requirement: Autoscaler Enabled
title: Ensure Cluster Autoscaler is Enabled and Configured
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes cluster has the autoscaler enabled
  and properly configured to adjust the number of nodes according to the workload
  demand. A well-configured autoscaler helps maintain optimal resource utilization,
  ensuring that the cluster can handle varying loads without manual intervention.
  This reduces the risk of resource exhaustion and improves the cluster's resilience
  against load-based attacks.
rationale: Without an enabled and properly configured cluster autoscaler, a Kubernetes
  cluster may waste resources or become under-provisioned, leading to potential denial
  of service. An improperly scaled cluster can be vulnerable to resource exhaustion
  attacks, where an attacker may attempt to induce excessive load to degrade service
  or cause outages.
