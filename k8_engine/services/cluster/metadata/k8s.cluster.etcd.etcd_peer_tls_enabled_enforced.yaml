resource: etcd
requirement: Etcd Peer Tls Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce TLS for Etcd Peer Communication
description: This control checks that TLS is enforced for communication between etcd
  peers in a Kubernetes cluster. A correctly configured etcd will have peer certificates
  and keys specified in its configuration, ensuring all peer-to-peer traffic is encrypted.
  This prevents eavesdropping and tampering by unauthorized parties, thus maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity within the cluster.
rationale: Etcd is the key-value store for Kubernetes, holding all cluster data. If
  TLS is not enforced for peer communication, it exposes the cluster to man-in-the-middle
  attacks, where an attacker could intercept and manipulate sensitive data. This misconfiguration
  can lead to unauthorized data access, integrity issues, and potential cluster compromise.
