resource: backup
requirement: And Restore Procedures Documented
title: Documented Backup and Restore Procedures for Kubernetes Clusters
description: This rule checks that backup and restore procedures for Kubernetes clusters
  are thoroughly documented. Proper documentation includes a detailed plan for regular
  backups, the steps required to restore from a backup, and testing of these procedures
  to ensure effectiveness. By having these procedures documented, organizations can
  quickly respond to incidents, reduce the risk of data loss, and ensure compliance
  with standards that require data integrity and availability.
rationale: Without documented backup and restore procedures, a Kubernetes cluster
  is vulnerable to data loss and prolonged downtime in the event of a disaster or
  malicious attack. This can lead to a loss of critical data and compromise the availability
  of applications running within the cluster. Documented procedures ensure that backups
  are consistently performed and can be reliably restored, minimizing recovery time
  and maintaining business continuity.
