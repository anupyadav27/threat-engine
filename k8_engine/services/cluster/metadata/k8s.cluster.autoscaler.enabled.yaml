title: Ensure Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler is Enabled and Configured Correctly
description: This control checks if the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler is enabled and
  configured according to best practices. A correctly configured autoscaler dynamically
  adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster based on workload demand, ensuring efficient
  resource utilization and cost management. This reduces the risk of security incidents
  by limiting the resources available for potential exploitation and ensuring that
  scaling decisions are made securely. Proper configuration includes setting appropriate
  scaling policies and limits that align with the organization's security requirements
  and workload characteristics.
rationale: An improperly configured or disabled Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can
  lead to inefficient resource management, resulting in service disruption, increased
  attack surface due to over-provisioned resources, and potential denial of service.
  Enabling and properly configuring the autoscaler ensures that the cluster scales
  in response to workload demands, minimizing unused resources and reducing the risk
  of attacks exploiting idle resources.
