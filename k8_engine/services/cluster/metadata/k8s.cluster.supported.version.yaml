title: Ensure Kubernetes Clusters Run Supported and Secure Versions
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes cluster is running a version
  that is currently supported by the Kubernetes community, which typically includes
  the last three minor releases. A supported version ensures that the cluster receives
  timely security patches and updates, reducing the risk of exploitation from known
  vulnerabilities. A good configuration is one where the cluster version is regularly
  reviewed and upgraded as newer, secure versions become available. This practice
  aids in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the cluster environments.
rationale: Running outdated or unsupported Kubernetes versions exposes the cluster
  to known vulnerabilities and exploits, as these versions no longer receive security
  patches. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access,
  disrupt services, or exfiltrate data. Keeping the cluster up-to-date mitigates these
  risks and ensures alignment with security best practices.
