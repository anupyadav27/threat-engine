service: cluster
resource: etcd
requirement: Backup Encryption Enabled Enforced
title: Ensure Etcd Backup Encryption is Enabled
description: This control checks whether encryption is enabled for etcd backups in
  a Kubernetes cluster. A properly configured backup encryption ensures that the data
  is encrypted at rest, protecting it from unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. A good configuration involves using strong encryption standards and regularly
  verifying that encryption is consistently applied. By enforcing encryption on etcd
  backups, the risk of data exposure is minimized, thereby enhancing the overall security
  posture of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Etcd stores all cluster data, including secrets and configuration details.
  If backup encryption is misconfigured, sensitive data may be exposed during backup
  processes, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access or interception by attackers
  who exploit unsecured backups.
