requirement: Version Supported Configured
title: Ensure Namespace Uses Supported Kubernetes API Versions
description: This control checks whether namespaces within a Kubernetes cluster are
  configured to use supported API versions. A valid configuration ensures that namespaces
  are not relying on deprecated or obsolete API versions, which might lack critical
  security updates. This verification helps maintain a secure environment by aligning
  with current Kubernetes security practices and reducing the attack surface. A well-configured
  namespace with up-to-date API versions ensures adherence to industry standards,
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, and minimizes vulnerabilities.
rationale: Using unsupported Kubernetes API versions in namespaces exposes clusters
  to security vulnerabilities and potential compatibility issues. Unsupported versions
  may contain unpatched security flaws that attackers can exploit, leading to unauthorized
  access or data breaches. Keeping API versions updated mitigates these risks and
  ensures compatibility with security features and policies.
