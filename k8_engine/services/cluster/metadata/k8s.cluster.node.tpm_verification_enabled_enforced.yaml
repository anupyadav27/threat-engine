requirement: Tpm Verification Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce TPM Verification on Cluster Nodes
description: This control checks whether Trusted Platform Module (TPM) verification
  is enabled and enforced on all Kubernetes cluster nodes. Proper TPM configuration
  ensures that nodes can prove their integrity and trustworthiness before becoming
  part of the cluster. Verification is achieved by validating that nodes are equipped
  with TPM hardware and configured to use it for attestation. A correct setup prevents
  nodes with potentially compromised hardware from joining the cluster, thereby protecting
  against attacks that could exploit compromised hardware to gain unauthorized access
  or control.
rationale: Without TPM verification, nodes may be susceptible to unauthorized access
  and tampering, such as firmware attacks or unauthorized hardware modifications.
  This can lead to potential data breaches and compromise of the entire cluster. Enforcing
  TPM verification helps ensure that only trusted hardware can join the cluster, mitigating
  risks associated with physical and firmware attacks.
