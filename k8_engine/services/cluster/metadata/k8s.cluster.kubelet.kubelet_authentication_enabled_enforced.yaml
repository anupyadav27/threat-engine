resource: kubelet
requirement: Kubelet Authentication Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Kubelet Authentication to Prevent Unauthorized Access
description: "This control checks if kubelet authentication is enabled on all nodes\
  \ in the Kubernetes cluster. Proper configuration requires setting up authentication\
  \ mechanisms like client certificates, bearer tokens, or authentication plugins.\
  \ Enforcing kubelet authentication ensures that only authorized users or services\
  \ can interact with the kubelet API, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access\
  \ that could exploit the node\u2019s resources or data."
rationale: Without proper kubelet authentication, unauthorized entities could gain
  access to the kubelet API, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the nodes,
  retrieve sensitive information, or disrupt workloads. This misconfiguration could
  lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, and denial of service attacks.
