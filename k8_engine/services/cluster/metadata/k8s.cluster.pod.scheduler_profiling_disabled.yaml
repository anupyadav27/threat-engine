requirement: Scheduler Profiling Disabled
title: Disable Scheduler Profiling in Kubernetes Clusters
description: This control checks that the profiling feature in the Kubernetes scheduler
  is disabled. Profiling is primarily used for debugging and can reveal sensitive
  operational information. A secure configuration ensures that the '--profiling' flag
  is set to 'false' in the scheduler configuration, preventing the exposure of profiling
  endpoints. This aligns with best security practices by reducing unnecessary information
  exposure and potential attack vectors.
rationale: Leaving scheduler profiling enabled can expose internal metrics and operational
  details about the Kubernetes scheduler, which may be exploited by attackers to perform
  reconnaissance and craft targeted attacks. By disabling scheduler profiling, the
  attack surface is reduced, minimizing the risk of unauthorized data exposure and
  enhancing the overall security posture of the cluster.
