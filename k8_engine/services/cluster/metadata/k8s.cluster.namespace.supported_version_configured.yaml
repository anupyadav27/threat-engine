requirement: Supported Version Configured
title: Ensure Namespace Uses Supported Kubernetes API Versions
description: This control checks that all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster are
  configured to use supported API versions. It validates against the list of deprecated
  and removed API versions as per the official Kubernetes deprecation policy. Proper
  configuration ensures that namespaces leverage up-to-date and secure API functionalities,
  reducing exposure to known vulnerabilities and ensuring compatibility with other
  Kubernetes components. This practice aligns with security best practices and compliance
  frameworks that emphasize using supported software versions.
rationale: Using unsupported API versions in a Kubernetes cluster can lead to vulnerabilities
  due to unpatched security flaws and compatibility issues. Attackers might exploit
  deprecated features or unmaintained APIs to gain unauthorized access or escalate
  privileges within the cluster. Ensuring namespaces are configured with supported
  API versions is crucial to mitigate these risks and maintain a secure and stable
  environment.
