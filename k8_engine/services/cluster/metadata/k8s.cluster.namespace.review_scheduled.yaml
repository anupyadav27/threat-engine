title: Regular Namespace Security Review Scheduling
description: This check ensures that a schedule is set for regular reviews of all
  namespace configurations in the Kubernetes cluster. Proper scheduling allows for
  timely identification and remediation of security issues, such as misconfigured
  network policies or improper resource quotas. A well-configured review schedule
  ensures namespaces comply with security standards and reduces the risk of breaches
  by maintaining updated policies.
rationale: Without regular reviews of namespace configurations, there's a risk of
  unnoticed security misconfigurations that attackers can exploit. These might include
  overly permissive access controls or outdated policies that could lead to unauthorized
  access or privilege escalation.
