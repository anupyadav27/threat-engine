service: cluster
resource: pod
requirement: Apiserver Insecure Bind Address Configured
title: Disable Insecure Bind Address for API Server
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes API server is not configured to
  bind to an insecure address, such as 0.0.0.0 without TLS. A secure configuration
  ensures the API server only listens on secured endpoints, enforcing encrypted communication
  channels and authentication. This reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks
  and unauthorized access, thus maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the
  cluster.
rationale: Exposing the API server on an insecure bind address can lead to unauthorized
  access and data interception, as it allows unauthenticated, unencrypted connections.
  Attackers could exploit this to capture sensitive information or execute unauthorized
  commands on the cluster.
