requirement: Anonymous Access Disabled Enforced
title: Disable Anonymous Access to Kubernetes API Server
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured to disable
  anonymous access by setting the '--anonymous-auth=false' flag. A secure configuration
  ensures that all API requests are authenticated, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and protecting sensitive data and resources within the cluster. Proper configuration
  aligns with security best practices and compliance standards, mitigating potential
  attack vectors such as unauthorized API requests.
rationale: If anonymous access is enabled, unauthenticated users can interact with
  the Kubernetes API server, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access
  to cluster resources. This can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and
  denial of service attacks. Disabling anonymous access ensures that only authenticated
  and authorized users can perform actions on the cluster.
