title: Enforce Standardized Resource Annotations
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes resources have standardized annotations
  as defined by organizational policy. Proper annotations help automate policy enforcement,
  streamline resource management, and enhance auditing capabilities. Standardized
  annotations can include security-related information, such as compliance tags or
  environment indicators, which are crucial for maintaining security controls and
  ensuring compliance with regulations such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Inconsistent or absent resource annotations can lead to mismanaged resources,
  inefficient operations, and increased risk of unauthorized access. Without standardized
  annotations, it is difficult to enforce policies, track resources for auditing purposes,
  or apply automated security checks. Attackers may exploit these misconfigurations
  to gain unauthorized insights into the cluster configuration or access sensitive
  workloads.
