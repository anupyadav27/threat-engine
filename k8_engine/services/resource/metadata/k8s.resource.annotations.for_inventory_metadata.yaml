requirement: For Inventory Metadata
title: Ensure Kubernetes Resource Annotations Include Inventory Metadata
description: This rule checks that all Kubernetes resources are annotated with standardized
  inventory metadata. Proper annotations facilitate better asset management, streamline
  audits, and enhance traceability. A well-annotated resource includes metadata that
  identifies ownership, purpose, and compliance requirements, which collectively help
  in maintaining a secure and compliant Kubernetes environment by enabling better
  monitoring and incident response.
rationale: Without proper inventory metadata annotations, tracking and managing Kubernetes
  resources becomes challenging, increasing the risk of configuration drift, unauthorized
  modifications, and compliance violations. Attackers can exploit poorly documented
  resources to establish persistence or escalate privileges within the cluster.
