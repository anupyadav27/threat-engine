title: Ensure Consistent and Secure Resource Annotations
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes resource annotations are maintained
  according to a predefined security policy. It ensures that annotations, which may
  include important security metadata, are correctly configured and not left in a
  default or insecure state. Properly configured annotations help in enforcing security
  policies, operational automation, and auditing, thereby reducing the risk of security
  breaches and ensuring compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: If resource annotations are not consistently maintained, it can lead to
  misconfigurations that attackers might exploit to gain unauthorized access or disrupt
  services. Annotations can be used to convey security policies or operational metadata,
  and mismanaged annotations could result in non-compliance with security baselines,
  making the cluster vulnerable to attacks such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration.
