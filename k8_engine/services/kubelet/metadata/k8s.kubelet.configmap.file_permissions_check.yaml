rule_id: k8s.kubelet.configmap.file_permissions_check
service: kubelet
resource: configmap
requirement: File Permissions Check
title: Ensure Kubelet ConfigMap Files Have Secure Permissions
description: This control checks that the Kubelet's ConfigMap files have permissions
  set to restrict access to only necessary users and processes. Specifically, it validates
  that these files are not globally readable or writable, adhering to the principle
  of least privilege. Ensuring proper file permissions helps mitigate risks of unauthorized
  access or tampering, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining cluster integrity.
rationale: Improper file permissions on Kubelet ConfigMap files can lead to unauthorized
  access or modification by malicious actors. This misconfiguration could allow an
  attacker to read sensitive information or inject malicious content, facilitating
  data breaches or privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster.
