requirement: Auth Disabled
title: Disable Anonymous Authentication for Kubelet
description: This control checks that the kubelet is configured with anonymous authentication
  set to false. A secure configuration ensures that all requests to the kubelet are
  authenticated, preventing unauthorized users from executing commands or accessing
  sensitive information. Disabling anonymous access strengthens the security posture
  by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can interact with the kubelet
  API, mitigating potential unauthorized access and privilege escalation attacks.
rationale: Enabling anonymous authentication for the kubelet allows unauthenticated
  users to access kubelet APIs, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  node-level operations. This misconfiguration could be exploited to gain unauthorized
  access to node resources, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt cluster operations.
