resource: read
requirement: Only Port Disabled
title: Disable Kubelet Read-Only Port
description: This control checks that the kubelet's read-only port (default 10255)
  is disabled. A correct configuration involves setting the `--read-only-port=0` flag
  in the kubelet configuration. By disabling the read-only port, unnecessary access
  to kubelet metrics and potentially sensitive data are blocked, enhancing the security
  posture of the Kubernetes nodes. This configuration aligns with best practices for
  minimizing exposed services and helps ensure compliance with security benchmarks
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: The kubelet read-only port, by default, exposes sensitive endpoints without
  authentication, allowing potential attackers to retrieve cluster information and
  perform reconnaissance. Disabling this port mitigates the risk of unauthorized access
  to kubelet endpoints, thereby reducing the attack surface and preventing data leakage
  or malicious actions against the cluster.
