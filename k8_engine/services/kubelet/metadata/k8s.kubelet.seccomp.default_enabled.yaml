resource: seccomp
requirement: Default Enabled
title: Enable Default Seccomp Profile for Kubelet
description: This rule checks if the default seccomp profile is enabled in the kubelet
  configuration. A correctly configured default seccomp profile restricts the system
  calls available to containers, mitigating the risk of kernel exploitation and maintaining
  compliance with security benchmarks. The configuration is deemed secure when the
  `--seccomp-profile-root` is set, and the default profile is applied to containers
  unless explicitly overridden. This helps enforce policy consistency and reduces
  the likelihood of configuration drift that might lead to security vulnerabilities.
rationale: Seccomp provides an additional layer of security by restricting system
  calls that containers can make, reducing the attack surface. Without a default seccomp
  profile, containers may have unrestricted access to system calls, potentially allowing
  attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel and gain unauthorized access
  or escalate privileges.
