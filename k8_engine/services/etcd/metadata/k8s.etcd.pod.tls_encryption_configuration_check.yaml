service: etcd
resource: pod
requirement: Tls Encryption Configuration Check
title: Ensure TLS Encryption for etcd Communication
description: This control checks that the etcd pods in a Kubernetes cluster are configured
  to use TLS for all client and peer communication. Proper TLS configuration involves
  setting up x.509 certificates for mutual authentication and encrypting data in transit.
  This practice ensures that data exchanged with etcd is secure from eavesdropping
  and tampering, meeting compliance with security standards such as CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, data transmitted between Kubernetes components
  and etcd can be intercepted and potentially modified by adversaries. This exposes
  sensitive cluster configuration data and secrets, leading to risks such as man-in-the-middle
  attacks and data breaches.
