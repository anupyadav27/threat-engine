resource: etcd
requirement: Ca Uniqueness Configured
title: Ensure Unique CA Certificates for etcd in Kubernetes
description: This rule checks that each etcd instance in a Kubernetes cluster is configured
  with a unique Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. A properly configured CA ensures
  that each instance can be individually authenticated, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access. This practice is aligned with industry security standards, preventing potential
  breaches and ensuring that etcd data remains secure and isolated. Configuration
  should follow the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark for securing etcd, which includes issuing
  distinct certificates for each instance.
rationale: Using unique CA certificates for each etcd instance mitigates the risk
  of man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access. If CA certificates are not
  unique, an attacker with access to one etcd instance could potentially use the same
  credentials to access others, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of
  the cluster's data.
