service: etcd
resource: ca
requirement: Uniqueness Check
title: Ensure Unique CA Certificates for etcd
description: This control checks that each etcd instance is using a unique CA certificate.
  A properly configured unique CA certificate ensures that data transmission between
  etcd and its clients is secure, mitigating risks of unauthorized data access or
  tampering. This configuration aligns with security best practices and compliance
  standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, which mandates secure communication
  between cluster components.
rationale: If CA certificates in etcd are not unique, it could allow attackers to
  intercept and alter sensitive data between Kubernetes components, leveraging man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Unique certificates ensure that each connection is verified, maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of data within the cluster.
