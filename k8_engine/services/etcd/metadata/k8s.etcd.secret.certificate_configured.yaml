resource: secret
requirement: Certificate Configured
title: Ensure TLS Certificates are Configured for etcd Secrets
description: This check verifies that TLS certificates are correctly configured for
  etcd, ensuring that all data in transit is encrypted. Proper TLS setup includes
  ensuring that certificates are valid, correctly signed, and their usage is properly
  specified. This helps prevent unauthorized access and data breaches, maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of the cluster's state data.
rationale: Without proper TLS certificates, communication between the Kubernetes API
  server and etcd could be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, as well as unauthorized
  data interception. This control mitigates the risk of sensitive information being
  compromised during transmission.
