requirement: Schedule Defined
title: Ensure Scheduled ETCD Snapshots for Disaster Recovery
description: This control checks that etcd snapshots are scheduled at regular intervals
  to ensure that data can be restored quickly in the event of data corruption or loss.
  A well-configured snapshot schedule allows for timely recovery from incidents, maintains
  data integrity, and ensures compliance with disaster recovery policies. This reduces
  the risk of prolonged outages and helps maintain cluster security by ensuring that
  only authorized, verified data is restored.
rationale: Without a scheduled snapshot, etcd data may be lost or corrupted due to
  unforeseen events like node failures or attacks, compromising the integrity and
  availability of the Kubernetes cluster. This increases the risk of prolonged downtime
  and data loss, making recovery difficult and potentially leading to unauthorized
  access or data breaches.
