service: etcd
resource: pod
requirement: Client Cert Auth Enabled
title: Enable Client Certificate Authentication for etcd
description: This control checks if client certificate authentication is enabled for
  the etcd pod. It validates the 'client-cert-auth' flag in the etcd configuration.
  A secure setup ensures that only clients with valid certificates, issued by a trusted
  Certificate Authority, can communicate with etcd. This prevents unauthorized access,
  ensuring that only trusted entities can read or write cluster state data, thus maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality.
rationale: Without client certificate authentication, etcd is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access, as any client can establish a connection without proving its identity. This
  exposes the cluster to potential data exfiltration and configuration tampering,
  as attackers could read or modify sensitive cluster data stored in etcd.
