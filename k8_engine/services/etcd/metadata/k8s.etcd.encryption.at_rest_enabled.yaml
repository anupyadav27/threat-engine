service: etcd
resource: encryption
requirement: At Rest Enabled
title: Enable Encryption for Data at Rest in etcd
description: This control checks that encryption is enabled for data stored at rest
  in etcd, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized users.
  To comply, etcd must be configured with encryption keys to encrypt data before it's
  written to disk. A proper configuration involves setting the encryption provider
  in etcd's configuration file and verifying that all data is encrypted. This reduces
  the risk of exposing sensitive information if the storage system is accessed by
  unauthorized parties, thus maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of cluster
  data.
rationale: Without encryption at rest, sensitive data stored in etcd, such as secrets
  and configuration, is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying storage
  is compromised. Attackers with access to the etcd data can extract secrets and compromise
  the entire Kubernetes cluster, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
  violations.
