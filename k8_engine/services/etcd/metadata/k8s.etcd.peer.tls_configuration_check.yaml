service: etcd
resource: peer
requirement: Tls Configuration Check
title: Ensure etcd Peer-to-Peer TLS Encryption
description: This check ensures that TLS encryption is enabled and properly configured
  for etcd peer-to-peer communication. It validates the presence of necessary certificates
  and configuration settings in etcd. Proper TLS configuration encrypts data in transit,
  protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering, and fulfills compliance with security
  standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to configure TLS for etcd peer communication can expose sensitive
  data to interception and unauthorized access. Without encryption, attackers could
  perform man-in-the-middle attacks, leading to data breaches and compromised cluster
  integrity.
