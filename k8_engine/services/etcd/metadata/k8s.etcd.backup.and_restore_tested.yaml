service: etcd
resource: backup
requirement: And Restore Tested
title: Regular Testing of ETCD Backup and Restore Procedures
description: This control verifies that backup and restore procedures for etcd are
  tested regularly to ensure data recovery capabilities are intact. A valid configuration
  involves automated or manual testing of backup integrity and restoration processes.
  Confirming these procedures are operational helps mitigate risks of data loss, ensures
  business continuity, and maintains compliance with industry standards. Effective
  testing demonstrates that the system can recover from failures or attacks, preserving
  cluster state and functionality.
rationale: Without regular testing of etcd backup and restore procedures, a Kubernetes
  cluster may face significant downtime and data loss in the event of a failure. This
  can lead to service disruption, potential data breaches, and failure to meet compliance
  requirements. Attackers could exploit untested backup systems by corrupting or deleting
  data, knowing that restoration processes are ineffective.
