rule_id: k8s.etcd.auto.tls_check
service: etcd
resource: auto
requirement: Tls Check
title: Ensure etcd Has TLS Encryption Enabled
description: This control checks that TLS is enabled for etcd communications, ensuring
  that all data in transit is encrypted and secured from eavesdropping. A properly
  configured TLS setup involves having both certificates and keys correctly installed
  and configured on etcd endpoints. This configuration mitigates the risk of data
  interception and unauthorized access, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of the data stored in etcd.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, data transmitted between the etcd server and its
  clients can be intercepted and read by malicious actors. This could lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive cluster data, including secrets and configuration details, thereby
  facilitating potential man-in-the-middle attacks or data breaches.
