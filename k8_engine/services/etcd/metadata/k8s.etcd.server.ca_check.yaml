service: etcd
resource: server
requirement: Ca Check
title: Ensure etcd Server Uses Valid CA Certificates
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes etcd server is configured to
  use valid Certificate Authority (CA) certificates for authentication and encryption.
  A properly configured etcd server should have a CA file specified in its configuration,
  ensuring that all incoming connections are verified against a trusted CA. Validating
  this configuration helps ensure that only legitimate, authenticated clients and
  peers can access the etcd server, thus maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of the data stored in etcd.
rationale: Misconfigured or invalid CA certificates on the etcd server can lead to
  unauthorized access, data breaches, and man-in-the-middle attacks. By ensuring that
  the etcd server is properly using valid CA certificates, you mitigate the risk of
  rogue nodes joining the etcd cluster, protect sensitive data within etcd, and ensure
  that communication is secure and trusted.
