rule_id: k8s.etcd.tls.encryption_in_transit_check
service: etcd
resource: tls
requirement: Encryption In Transit Check
title: Ensure Encryption for etcd Communication
description: "This control checks that Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enabled for\
  \ all communications to and from the etcd server. Proper configuration involves\
  \ ensuring that the etcd server and clients are configured with valid certificates\
  \ and keys, and that mutual TLS authentication is enforced. This secures the data\
  \ in transit against man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized data access, thereby\
  \ maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the cluster\u2019s state data."
rationale: Without encryption in transit for etcd, sensitive data including configuration
  details, secrets, and access credentials are susceptible to interception by unauthorized
  entities. This could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to the cluster,
  as attackers can eavesdrop on traffic between the etcd server and its clients.
