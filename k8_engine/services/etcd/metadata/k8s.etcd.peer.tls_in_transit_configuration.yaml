resource: peer
requirement: Tls In Transit Configuration
title: Ensure TLS for etcd Peer Communication
description: This control verifies that etcd peer-to-peer communication is secured
  using Transport Layer Security (TLS). It checks for the presence of valid TLS certificates
  and ensures that they are correctly configured to encrypt data in transit. Proper
  TLS configuration mitigates risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive
  information within the etcd cluster, aligning with best practices and compliance
  requirements like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, communication between etcd peers is susceptible
  to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on
  or manipulate the data being exchanged. This poses a significant risk to the integrity
  and confidentiality of cluster data.
