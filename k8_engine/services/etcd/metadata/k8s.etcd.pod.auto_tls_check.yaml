rule_id: k8s.etcd.pod.auto_tls_check
service: etcd
resource: pod
requirement: Auto Tls Check
title: Enable Auto TLS for Etcd Pods
description: This check verifies that Etcd pods have Auto TLS enabled, which automatically
  generates client and server certificates to encrypt communications. A correct configuration
  ensures that all data in transit between etcd nodes and clients is encrypted, protecting
  against unauthorized interception. This helps maintain data confidentiality and
  integrity, significantly reducing the risk of eavesdropping or data tampering, and
  aligns with CIS Kubernetes Benchmark standards for secure communication.
rationale: Without Auto TLS, data transmitted between etcd clients and servers is
  vulnerable to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks, as the data is not encrypted.
  This poses a significant risk of data breaches, especially if sensitive information
  is being stored in etcd. Proper TLS configuration helps ensure that the communication
  channels are secure and that only authorized parties can access the transmitted
  data.
