rule_id: k8s.etcd.etcd.pod_tls_encryption_configuration_configured
service: etcd
resource: etcd
requirement: Pod Tls Encryption Configuration Configured
title: Ensure etcd Pod TLS Encryption is Properly Configured
description: This rule checks that TLS encryption is properly configured for etcd
  pods, ensuring that all communication between etcd clients and servers is encrypted
  using TLS. Proper configuration involves setting up valid certificates and keys
  for etcd pods. This reduces the risk of data breaches by protecting against eavesdropping
  and tampering, and helps maintain compliance with security standards such as the
  CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If etcd Pod TLS encryption is misconfigured, sensitive data in transit
  between etcd nodes and clients is vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.
  Attackers could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising
  the integrity and confidentiality of cluster data.
