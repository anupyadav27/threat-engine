resource: backup
requirement: Scheduled
title: Ensure Scheduled Backups for etcd Data
description: This control checks that etcd data is backed up on a scheduled basis
  as per security best practices. A valid configuration includes automated, regular
  backups with secure storage. This ensures data recovery in case of corruption, accidental
  deletion, or compromise, thus maintaining the cluster's operational integrity and
  compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to schedule regular backups for etcd can result in data loss during
  critical failures or attacks. Misconfigured or absent backups expose the cluster
  to risks of data unavailability, integrity issues, and potential breaches from malicious
  actors aiming to disrupt or manipulate essential Kubernetes data stored in etcd.
