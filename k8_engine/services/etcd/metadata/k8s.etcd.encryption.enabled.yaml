title: Enable Data Encryption for etcd in Kubernetes
description: This control checks that encryption is enabled for data stored in etcd,
  which is critical for protecting sensitive information such as API server secrets.
  Enabling etcd encryption involves configuring the Kubernetes API server with an
  encryption config file, specifying the encryption providers (e.g., AES-CBC, Secretbox)
  and the resources to be encrypted. Proper configuration ensures the confidentiality
  of data at rest, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
rationale: Without encryption, data stored in etcd is vulnerable to unauthorized access
  and exfiltration. Attackers gaining access to etcd can intercept and manipulate
  sensitive data, including secrets and cluster state information, which can lead
  to privilege escalation and compromise of the entire Kubernetes cluster.
