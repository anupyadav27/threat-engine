rule_id: k8s.etcd.etcd.apiserver_ca_configured
service: etcd
resource: etcd
requirement: Apiserver Ca Configured
title: Ensure Etcd Server Uses a Secure Apiserver CA Configuration
description: This rule checks that the Etcd server is configured to use a trusted
  Certificate Authority (CA) for its interactions with the Kubernetes API server.
  A properly configured Apiserver CA ensures that the communication between the API
  server and Etcd is encrypted and authenticated, preventing unauthorized access and
  data tampering. A secure configuration includes using a valid and trusted CA certificate,
  ensuring that both the API server and Etcd trust the same CA. This helps in maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality, as well as protecting the cluster state from
  unauthorized modifications.
rationale: If the Etcd server is not configured with a secure Apiserver CA, it may
  be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
  Attackers could intercept or modify data in transit between the Kubernetes API server
  and Etcd, leading to potential leakage or tampering of sensitive cluster state information.
