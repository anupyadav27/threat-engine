resource: etcd
requirement: Patch Enforced
title: Ensure etcd is Regularly Patched and Upgraded
description: This control checks if the etcd database, which is critical for Kubernetes
  cluster operation, is up-to-date with the latest patches and upgrades. A good configuration
  involves implementing a regular patch management process to ensure etcd runs the
  latest stable version. This helps prevent potential exploits and maintains the integrity
  and availability of the Kubernetes control plane. It also aligns with best practices
  outlined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Unpatched etcd instances can be vulnerable to known exploits and vulnerabilities,
  which might lead to unauthorized access or data corruption. Attackers could exploit
  these vulnerabilities to gain control over Kubernetes API operations or access sensitive
  data stored in etcd. Regular patching minimizes these risks by ensuring that security
  vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.
