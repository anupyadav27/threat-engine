service: etcd
resource: cluster
requirement: State Backup Scheduled
title: Ensure Scheduled Backups for etcd Cluster State
description: This control verifies that the etcd cluster state is configured to perform
  regular, automated backups. A valid configuration includes scheduling periodic snapshots
  and securely storing them. This practice mitigates risks of data loss from hardware
  failures, accidental deletions, or ransomware attacks that could compromise the
  cluster state. Ensuring that backup mechanisms are in place and tested aligns with
  best practices and compliance requirements.
rationale: Failure to schedule regular etcd backups can lead to catastrophic data
  loss in the event of a cluster failure, corruption, or malicious attack. As etcd
  stores all cluster state data, including secrets and configuration details, its
  loss can disrupt operations and expose sensitive information. Regular backups ensure
  data integrity and continuity by allowing recovery from failures or security incidents.
