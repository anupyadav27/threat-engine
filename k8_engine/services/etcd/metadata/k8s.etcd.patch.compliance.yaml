resource: patch
requirement: Compliance
title: Ensure etcd Patches Are Up-to-Date for Compliance
description: This control checks that the etcd component of a Kubernetes cluster is
  running the latest security patches. A well-maintained etcd ensures that known vulnerabilities
  are addressed, reducing the risk of exploitation. The validation process involves
  verifying the etcd version against the latest available stable release and ensuring
  that configurations align with security best practices. Regular patching of etcd
  helps in safeguarding the integrity and availability of critical cluster data and
  is essential for meeting compliance requirements such as those outlined by the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failing to keep etcd patched can expose Kubernetes clusters to vulnerabilities,
  potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. Attackers may exploit
  known vulnerabilities in unpatched etcd versions to access sensitive cluster data
  or disrupt cluster operations, which is critical for maintaining regulatory compliance
  and a strong security posture.
