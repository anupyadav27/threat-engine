resource: tls
requirement: Enabled
title: Enforce TLS Encryption for etcd Communication
description: This rule verifies that TLS is enabled for all communications between
  the Kubernetes API server and the etcd database. Proper configuration involves setting
  up mutual TLS authentication to ensure that both parties are authenticated and data
  is encrypted during transit. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
  cluster data, mitigates potential data leaks, and aligns with compliance requirements
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A well-implemented TLS setup includes generating
  and configuring certificates for both the client and server, which are then used
  to establish secure connections.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, data transmitted between the Kubernetes API server
  and the etcd database is susceptible to interception and unauthorized access. Attackers
  could exploit this vulnerability to capture sensitive data, manipulate cluster state,
  or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. Enforcing TLS ensures data integrity and confidentiality,
  crucial for preventing these security breaches.
