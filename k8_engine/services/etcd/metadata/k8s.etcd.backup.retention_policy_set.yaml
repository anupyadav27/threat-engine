service: etcd
resource: backup
requirement: Retention Policy Set
title: Configure and Enforce Etcd Backup Retention Policies
description: This control checks that etcd backups have a configured retention policy,
  ensuring that backups are retained only for a necessary period. A well-defined retention
  policy helps limit the exposure of sensitive data, minimizes storage costs, and
  reduces the risk of data leakage by ensuring old backups are securely deleted. Implementing
  this policy allows organizations to maintain compliance with security standards
  and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, by managing data lifecycle effectively.
rationale: Without a proper retention policy for etcd backups, sensitive data may
  be retained longer than necessary, increasing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized
  access. Attackers could exploit improperly managed backups to access historical
  data, leading to potential data exfiltration or unauthorized insights into the cluster's
  state.
