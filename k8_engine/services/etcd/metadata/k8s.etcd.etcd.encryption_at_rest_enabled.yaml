resource: etcd
requirement: Encryption At Rest Enabled
title: Enable Encryption at Rest for etcd Data
description: This check ensures that encryption at rest is enabled for etcd, which
  involves configuring etcd to use a secure encryption provider to encrypt data before
  it is written to disk. A correctly configured encryption at rest setup requires
  setting up an encryption configuration file and specifying the encryption providers
  and keys. This setup protects sensitive data from unauthorized access, even if the
  data store is compromised, and aligns with best practices and compliance requirements
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without encryption at rest, sensitive data stored in etcd is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access and data breaches. Attackers who gain access to the etcd
  data directory may directly read sensitive information, such as service accounts,
  secrets, and config maps, which can lead to privilege escalation and exploitation
  of the cluster.
