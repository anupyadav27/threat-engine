rule_id: k8s.etcd.etcd.auto_tls_configured
service: etcd
resource: etcd
requirement: Auto Tls Configured
title: Enable Auto TLS for etcd Communication
description: This rule checks that etcd is configured with Auto TLS, which automatically
  generates and rotates certificates for secure communication between etcd nodes and
  clients. A proper Auto TLS configuration ensures that all data exchanged is encrypted,
  mitigating the risk of eavesdropping or data tampering by unauthorized entities.
  This is critical to protect against unauthorized access to sensitive cluster data
  and to comply with security best practices such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without Auto TLS, etcd communication may be susceptible to man-in-the-middle
  attacks, where an attacker could intercept and alter data between the etcd nodes
  and clients. This configuration ensures encryption of data in transit, preventing
  unauthorized access and maintaining confidentiality and integrity of the cluster's
  state data.
