resource: container
requirement: Vulnerability Scanning Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Automated Vulnerability Scanning on Pod Containers
description: This control verifies that all Kubernetes pod containers have automated
  vulnerability scanning enabled and enforced. A good configuration requires integration
  with a vulnerability scanning tool that checks container images for known vulnerabilities
  before they are deployed. By ensuring this, the system can prevent the deployment
  of containers with critical vulnerabilities, thus maintaining the integrity and
  security of the Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, it supports compliance with security
  standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without automated vulnerability scanning, container images may contain
  unpatched vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized
  access or disrupt services. Vulnerability scanning helps identify known vulnerabilities
  in container images before deployment, reducing the risk of exploitation and ensuring
  a secure runtime environment.
