title: Ensure Pods Define SecurityContext for Enhanced Isolation
description: This control checks that each Kubernetes pod has a SecurityContext defined.
  A well-configured SecurityContext ensures that key security settings such as runAsUser,
  runAsGroup, and capabilities are explicitly specified, reducing the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access. By enforcing these configurations, the cluster's
  security posture is strengthened, and compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark is maintained. Specifically, the SecurityContext should disable privileged
  mode, set read-only root filesystem, and drop unnecessary Linux capabilities.
rationale: A misconfigured or undefined SecurityContext in Kubernetes pods can lead
  to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
  Attackers may exploit these vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges or execute
  malicious code within the cluster. Properly defining a SecurityContext helps mitigate
  risks by enforcing security policies around user privileges and resource access.
