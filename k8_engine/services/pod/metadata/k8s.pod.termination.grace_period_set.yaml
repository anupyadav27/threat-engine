resource: termination
requirement: Grace Period Set
title: Ensure Pod Termination Grace Period is Configured
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes pods have a termination grace
  period explicitly set. A well-configured grace period allows pods to shut down gracefully,
  ensuring that any in-flight transactions are completed and resources are properly
  released, reducing the risk of data inconsistency and service unavailability. A
  grace period aligned with application needs also helps maintain compliance with
  security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: A misconfigured pod termination grace period can lead to abrupt shutdowns,
  risking data loss and service disruptions. Attackers could exploit this to cause
  denial of service by overwhelming the system with ungraceful pod terminations.
