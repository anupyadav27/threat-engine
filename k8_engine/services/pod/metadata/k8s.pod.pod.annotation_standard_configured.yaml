requirement: Annotation Standard Configured
title: Ensure Pod Annotations for Security Policies Are Configured
description: This control checks that Kubernetes pods have the appropriate annotations
  configured in accordance with security best practices. It verifies that annotations
  intended for security policy enforcement, such as those used by admission controllers
  or third-party security tools, are present and correct. Proper configuration helps
  to enforce security policies consistently across the cluster, reducing the risk
  of misconfiguration and ensuring adherence to compliance requirements, such as those
  outlined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Annotations in Kubernetes pods can be used to enforce security policies
  or provide metadata that influences security controls. If annotations are not properly
  configured, it may lead to misinterpretation of security policies, leaving pods
  vulnerable to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. For example, misconfigured
  annotations could fail to trigger necessary security policies, exposing the organization
  to insider threats or external attacks.
