resource: security
requirement: Standard Review Scheduled
title: Schedule Regular Pod Security Reviews
description: This control checks if a regular review process is in place for Kubernetes
  pod security configurations. A properly scheduled review ensures that pod security
  settings adhere to current best practices and standards, such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark. It helps identify and rectify misconfigurations that could lead to security
  breaches, thus enhancing the overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Without regular security reviews, pod configurations may become outdated,
  leading to increased risk of vulnerabilities and exposure to exploitation such as
  privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  to gain control over cluster resources or access sensitive data.
