rule_id: k8s.pod.securitycontext.readonly_rootfs
service: pod
resource: securitycontext
requirement: Readonly Rootfs
title: Enforce Read-Only Root Filesystem for Pods
description: This rule checks that the 'readOnlyRootFilesystem' attribute in the pod's
  security context is set to 'true'. A properly configured read-only root filesystem
  ensures that the container's root file system is immutable, protecting against unauthorized
  changes and enhancing the pod's overall security by limiting what an attacker can
  do. It aligns with security best practices and industry standards to reduce attack
  surfaces and improve container integrity.
rationale: Configuring a read-only root filesystem is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  modifications to the file system of a running pod. If misconfigured, attackers who
  gain access to a container might exploit write permissions to the root file system
  to install malware, tamper with application binaries, or escalate privileges, leading
  to potential data breaches and system compromise.
