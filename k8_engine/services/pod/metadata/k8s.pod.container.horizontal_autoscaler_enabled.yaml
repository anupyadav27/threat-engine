requirement: Horizontal Autoscaler Enabled
title: Ensure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is Configured
description: This control checks that the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is enabled
  and correctly configured for Kubernetes pods. An effective HPA configuration ensures
  that the application dynamically adjusts the number of pod replicas in response
  to workload changes, based on metrics like CPU utilization or custom metrics. This
  proactive scaling helps in preventing resource exhaustion, which could otherwise
  lead to service outages or increased exposure to attacks. A good configuration includes
  setting appropriate thresholds for scaling events and ensuring that the HPA is integrated
  with the monitoring and alerting systems for timely responses.
rationale: Without a properly configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), applications
  may experience downtime or degraded performance due to the inability to automatically
  scale in response to demand. This can lead to resource exhaustion, potential denial
  of service, and increased vulnerability to attacks that exploit overloaded systems.
  Proper autoscaling helps maintain availability, performance, and resilience against
  such risks.
