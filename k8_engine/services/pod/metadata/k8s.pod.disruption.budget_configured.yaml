rule_id: k8s.pod.disruption.budget_configured
service: pod
resource: disruption
requirement: Budget Configured
title: Ensure PodDisruptionBudget is Configured
description: This rule checks that a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) is defined for critical
  application pods to control voluntary disruptions such as node upgrades or scale-downs.
  A well-configured PDB ensures that a minimum number of pods remains available, maintaining
  service continuity and reducing the attack surface during disruption periods. A
  valid configuration specifies either 'minAvailable' or 'maxUnavailable' to control
  the number of pods that can be disrupted at a time, following best practices for
  high availability.
rationale: Without a properly configured PodDisruptionBudget, critical applications
  may experience unexpected downtime during node maintenance or scaling events, increasing
  the risk of service unavailability and potential breaches. Attackers could exploit
  service disruptions to launch additional attacks during recovery phases.
