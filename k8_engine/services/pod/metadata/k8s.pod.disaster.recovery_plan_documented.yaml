resource: disaster
requirement: Recovery Plan Documented
title: Document Disaster Recovery Plan for Kubernetes Pods
description: This control verifies that a comprehensive disaster recovery plan is
  documented for Kubernetes pods. A good configuration includes details on backup
  schedules, restoration procedures, and roles and responsibilities during a disaster.
  This documentation helps in ensuring that in case of a failure, the recovery process
  is efficient and effective, thereby reducing the time to restore operations and
  protecting critical data against loss. It also assists in meeting regulatory compliance
  requirements by demonstrating preparedness for incidents.
rationale: Without a documented disaster recovery plan, Kubernetes environments are
  vulnerable to prolonged outages and data loss in the event of a failure. Misconfiguration
  can lead to inadequate backup procedures, leaving the system exposed to data corruption
  or loss due to unexpected failures or attacks, such as ransomware. A well-documented
  plan ensures quick recovery, minimizing downtime and maintaining business continuity.
