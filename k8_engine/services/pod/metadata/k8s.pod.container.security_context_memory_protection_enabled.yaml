requirement: Security Context Memory Protection Enabled
title: Enforce Seccomp Profile for Pod Containers
description: This rule checks that each container within a Kubernetes pod has a Seccomp
  profile set in its security context. A Seccomp profile restricts the set of system
  calls that can be made by a container, reducing the potential attack surface. A
  well-configured Seccomp profile helps mitigate risks associated with kernel-level
  exploits by limiting the capabilities of a container to interact with the host kernel,
  thereby enhancing the security posture of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: If Seccomp is not enabled, containers may run with fewer restrictions on
  system calls, potentially allowing exploitation through system-level vulnerabilities.
  Attackers could leverage this to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
  perform denial-of-service attacks.
