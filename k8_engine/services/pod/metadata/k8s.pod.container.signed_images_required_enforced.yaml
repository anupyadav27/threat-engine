service: pod
resource: container
requirement: Signed Images Required Enforced
title: Enforce Image Signature Verification for Pod Containers
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes pod containers are configured to
  only run images that have been signed by a trusted source. It ensures that the ImagePolicyWebhook
  admission controller is in place to validate image signatures before they are deployed.
  Enforcing signed images helps prevent unauthorized or tampered images from being
  executed, thus maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the containerized
  applications.
rationale: If image signatures are not enforced, there is a risk that containers might
  run untrusted or malicious images. Attackers could inject malicious code into these
  images, leading to potential data breaches, privilege escalation, or service disruptions
  within the Kubernetes cluster.
