rule_id: k8s.pod.security.allow_privilege_escalation_restricted
service: pod
resource: security
requirement: Allow Privilege Escalation Restricted
title: Restrict Privilege Escalation in Pods
description: This rule checks that the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` setting is set to
  `false` in the pod's security context. A properly configured setting prevents processes
  within a container from gaining additional privileges, thus mitigating risks associated
  with privilege escalation attacks. This enhances the security posture by ensuring
  least privilege principles are adhered to and aligns with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
  and other security standards.
rationale: Allowing privilege escalation in containers can enable potential attackers
  to gain elevated privileges within a pod, leading to unauthorized access or control
  over the container and potentially the host system. This could be exploited through
  various attack vectors, such as exploiting vulnerable applications or misconfigurations,
  to perform privilege escalation attacks.
