title: Ensure Pod SecurityContext Limits Privileges
description: This control checks that the SecurityContext of each Kubernetes pod is
  configured to restrict privileges. Specifically, it ensures settings such as 'runAsNonRoot',
  'readOnlyRootFilesystem', and 'allowPrivilegeEscalation' are properly set to enforce
  least privilege principles. A properly configured SecurityContext helps mitigate
  risks of privilege escalation, reduces the attack surface, and ensures pods operate
  with only the permissions they need, thus enhancing the security posture of the
  cluster.
rationale: Misconfigured Pod SecurityContexts can lead to elevated privileges, allowing
  attackers to exploit vulnerabilities, escalate privileges, or perform unauthorized
  actions. For example, allowing a pod to run as the root user can enable attackers
  to compromise the host node.
