title: Enforce Consistent Pod Labeling for Security and Compliance
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes pods are labeled according to
  a predefined, consistent standard. Labels must be applied to all pods to facilitate
  effective resource management, access control, and auditing. Proper labeling supports
  network policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and security monitoring by ensuring
  that all resources are accounted for and can be associated with security policies.
  By enforcing a consistent labeling standard, organizations can improve their security
  posture, comply with industry regulations, and prevent unauthorized access and potential
  breaches.
rationale: Inconsistent or missing pod labels can lead to challenges in tracking,
  managing, and securing Kubernetes workloads. Attackers might exploit these weaknesses
  to bypass security policies, access unauthorized resources, or inject malicious
  workloads. Consistent labeling helps ensure that security controls and policies
  are accurately applied and enforced, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and
  unauthorized access.
