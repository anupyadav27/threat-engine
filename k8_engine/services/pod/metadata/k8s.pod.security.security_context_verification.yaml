resource: security
requirement: Security Context Verification
title: Enforce Pod Security Context Configuration
description: This control checks that each pod has a security context defined, enforcing
  settings such as non-root user execution, read-only root filesystem, and specific
  capabilities. A well-configured security context prevents pods from running with
  excessive privileges, limits the attack surface, and adheres to the principle of
  least privilege. This validation helps in maintaining robust security by ensuring
  pods operate under controlled conditions, reducing the likelihood of successful
  exploitation and aiding compliance with security benchmarks.
rationale: Misconfigured security contexts can lead to privilege escalation, unauthorized
  access, and potential compromise of the cluster. Attackers may exploit improperly
  set permissions to perform actions such as accessing the host filesystem or running
  with elevated privileges. Ensuring security contexts are correctly configured mitigates
  these risks by enforcing least privilege and isolating processes within the pod.
