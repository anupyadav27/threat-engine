resource: seccomp
requirement: Profile Runtime Default Check
title: Enforce Seccomp Default Profile for Pods
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes pods enforce the 'RuntimeDefault'
  seccomp profile. The 'RuntimeDefault' profile restricts the set of system calls
  available to containers, reducing the attack surface and mitigating risks of syscall-based
  attacks. Proper configuration helps prevent privilege escalation and ensures compliance
  with security benchmarks, such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without a default seccomp profile, pods may run with unconfined syscalls,
  increasing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to host resources.
  Attackers can exploit this to perform system calls that could compromise the host
  system.
