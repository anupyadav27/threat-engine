resource: securitycontext
requirement: Privileged Containers Prohibited Enforced
title: Enforce Non-Privileged Pod Security Context
description: 'This control checks that all pods are configured with a security context
  that prohibits privileged containers. A good configuration involves setting `privileged:
  false` within the pod''s security context. This helps ensure that containers run
  with the least privilege necessary, reducing the attack surface and mitigating the
  risks of unauthorized host access or privilege escalation attacks. Proper enforcement
  of this control aligns with best practices and industry standards, enhancing the
  overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.'
rationale: Privileged containers pose significant security risks as they grant elevated
  access to the host system, potentially allowing attackers to bypass container isolation
  and compromise the underlying infrastructure. If misconfigured, attackers could
  exploit vulnerabilities to gain root access, execute arbitrary code, or conduct
  privilege escalation attacks, compromising the entire cluster.
