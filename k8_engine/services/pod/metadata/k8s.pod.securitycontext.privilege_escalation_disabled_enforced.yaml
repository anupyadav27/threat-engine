rule_id: k8s.pod.securitycontext.privilege_escalation_disabled_enforced
service: pod
resource: securitycontext
requirement: Privilege Escalation Disabled Enforced
title: Enforce No Privilege Escalation in Pod SecurityContext
description: This rule ensures that the 'allowPrivilegeEscalation' setting in a pod's
  SecurityContext is set to 'false'. This configuration is checked against all pods
  in the cluster to ensure they do not allow privilege escalation. A properly configured
  SecurityContext prevents containers from acquiring additional privileges, thereby
  reducing the attack surface and mitigating the risk of privilege escalation attacks
  within the cluster. Ensuring 'allowPrivilegeEscalation' is set to 'false' aligns
  with Kubernetes security best practices and contributes to a more secure cluster
  environment.
rationale: Disabling privilege escalation in Kubernetes pods is critical to prevent
  attackers from gaining higher permissions from a compromised container. Without
  this control, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges,
  potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary commands as the root user, access
  sensitive data, or disrupt operations within the cluster.
