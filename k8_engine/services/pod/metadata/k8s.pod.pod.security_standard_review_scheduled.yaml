resource: pod
requirement: Security Standard Review Scheduled
title: Schedule Regular Security Reviews for Pods
description: This rule checks if there is a regular schedule for security reviews
  of Kubernetes pod configurations. A well-defined review schedule ensures that pods
  are evaluated against current security standards and best practices. This includes
  verifying compliance with Pod Security Standards, ensuring network policies are
  restrictive, and that RBAC policies are correctly applied. Regular reviews help
  maintain a secure environment by proactively identifying and mitigating potential
  security risks, thus ensuring compliance with industry standards such as the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Regular security reviews of pod configurations help identify vulnerabilities
  and misconfigurations that may lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  Without scheduled reviews, pods might run with outdated or insecure settings, making
  them susceptible to attacks, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities in container
  images or misconfigured network policies.
