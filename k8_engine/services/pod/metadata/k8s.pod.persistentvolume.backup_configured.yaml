resource: persistentvolume
requirement: Backup Configured
title: Ensure PersistentVolume Backups Are Configured and Verified
description: This control checks that PersistentVolumes used by Kubernetes Pods have
  an associated backup policy that is both configured and operational. A valid configuration
  typically involves automated, regular backups, stored securely offsite, and includes
  periodic restoration tests to verify data integrity and availability. Implementing
  this control helps ensure data resilience against failures and attacks, supports
  disaster recovery processes, and aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI
  DSS.
rationale: Without proper backup configuration, data stored in PersistentVolumes can
  be lost due to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or malicious attacks such
  as ransomware. This can result in significant business disruptions and data breaches.
  Ensuring backups are configured and regularly verified mitigates the risk of data
  loss and contributes to business continuity.
