requirement: Patches Applied
title: Ensure Pods are Running with Latest Security Patches
description: This control checks that all container images running in pods are up-to-date
  with the latest security patches. It involves verifying that the images used in
  deployments are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities and updated accordingly. A
  good configuration ensures that images are derived from trusted sources and are
  maintained with a patch management process. This practice helps in maintaining system
  integrity and compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Running pods without the latest security patches exposes your applications
  to known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. This may lead to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, or disruptions in service. By ensuring that your pods are
  up-to-date with the latest security patches, you reduce the attack surface and mitigate
  risks associated with unpatched vulnerabilities.
