rule_id: k8s.pod.node.host_pid_disabled_enforced
service: pod
resource: node
requirement: Host Pid Disabled Enforced
title: Disable Host PID Namespace Sharing in Pods
description: This rule checks that the 'hostPID' field is set to 'false' in pod specifications,
  ensuring that pods do not share the host's PID namespace. A correct configuration
  prevents pods from accessing the host's process table, thereby reducing the risk
  of privilege escalation and unauthorized process manipulation. This practice aligns
  with security best practices outlined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and enhances
  the overall security posture by isolating pod-level processes from the host.
rationale: Allowing pods to share the host's process ID namespace can lead to security
  vulnerabilities by enabling potential attackers to view and signal processes on
  the host, which could lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to host
  resources. Disabling host PID namespace sharing minimizes the attack surface and
  protects against these risks.
