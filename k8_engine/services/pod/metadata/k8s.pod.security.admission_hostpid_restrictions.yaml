resource: security
requirement: Admission Hostpid Restrictions
title: Restrict HostPID Namespace Access in Pods
description: This control checks that the HostPID field is set to false in pod specifications,
  thereby preventing pods from accessing the host's PID namespace. Proper configuration
  ensures that containerized processes are isolated from host processes, reducing
  the risk of process-level attacks. This improves the security posture by ensuring
  compliance with established security benchmarks like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark,
  enhancing process isolation, and preventing potential privilege escalation.
rationale: Allowing pods to share the host's PID namespace poses significant security
  risks by enabling potential process snooping and privilege escalation attacks. Malicious
  actors can exploit this access to interfere with or control host processes, leading
  to unauthorized access or denial of service. Ensuring that pods do not have unnecessary
  hostPID access is critical for maintaining isolation between host and container
  processes, thereby minimizing attack vectors.
