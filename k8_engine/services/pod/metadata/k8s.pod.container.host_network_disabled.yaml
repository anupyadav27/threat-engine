resource: container
requirement: Host Network Disabled
title: Disable Host Network Access in Pods
description: This rule checks that the 'hostNetwork' field is set to 'false' for all
  pod specifications. By disabling host network access, pods cannot share the host's
  network stack, reducing the risk of network-based attacks and ensuring isolation
  between the host and pod network traffic. A secure configuration prevents pods from
  interfering with host-level network settings and accessing the host's network interfaces
  directly.
rationale: Allowing pods to use the host's network namespace can expose the host to
  attacks such as network eavesdropping, IP spoofing, and unauthorized access to other
  services running on the host. This configuration can be exploited by a compromised
  pod to perform lateral movement and gain access to sensitive host-level resources.
