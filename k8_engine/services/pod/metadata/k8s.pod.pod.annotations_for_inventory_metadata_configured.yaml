service: pod
resource: pod
requirement: Annotations For Inventory Metadata Configured
title: Ensure Pods Have Inventory Metadata Annotations
description: This rule checks that each pod is annotated with inventory metadata,
  which includes details such as the application's owner, purpose, and environment.
  By maintaining these annotations, organizations can improve visibility and traceability
  of deployments, ensure accountability, and facilitate automated compliance checks.
  A well-annotated pod setup aids in incident investigation and helps prevent configuration
  drift by making sure all changes are logged and auditable.
rationale: Without proper inventory metadata annotations, it becomes challenging to
  track and audit the configuration and state of pods, complicating incident response
  and vulnerability management. This can lead to unmonitored changes, unauthorized
  access, and difficulty in maintaining compliance with security policies.
