requirement: Memory Protection Enabled
title: Enable Memory Protection in Pod Security Context
description: This rule checks if the security context of a Kubernetes pod is configured
  to enable memory protection mechanisms, such as read-only root filesystems or limiting
  access to shared memory segments. A secure configuration helps prevent unauthorized
  access to memory, reduces the attack surface, and aligns with security standards
  like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. Proper implementation restricts the actions that
  can be performed by processes within the container, enhancing the overall security
  of the workload.
rationale: Enabling memory protection in a Kubernetes pod's security context is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized memory access and mitigate potential exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  Without proper memory protection, attackers could manipulate application memory,
  leading to data breaches or compromised applications. This control is particularly
  vital in environments where sensitive data is processed, ensuring the application
  adheres to security best practices and regulatory requirements.
