resource: pod
requirement: Inventory Labels Maintained
title: Ensure Pods Have Accurate Inventory Labels
description: This control checks that all pods have accurate and consistent inventory
  labels applied. These labels should include metadata such as application name, environment,
  and version. Properly configured labels help in grouping and identifying pods for
  monitoring, logging, and applying security policies. They enable administrators
  to enforce security controls through tools like network policies and facilitate
  compliance with regulatory standards by providing a clear audit trail of resource
  usage.
rationale: Inventory labels on pods are crucial for ensuring efficient resource management,
  auditing, and security monitoring within Kubernetes clusters. Misconfigured or missing
  labels can lead to difficulty in tracking resource usage, hinder incident response
  efforts, and cause potential compliance issues. Attackers may exploit unlabeled
  or improperly labeled pods to obfuscate malicious activities and evade detection.
