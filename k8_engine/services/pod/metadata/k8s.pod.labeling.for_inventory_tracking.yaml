service: pod
resource: labeling
requirement: For Inventory Tracking
title: Ensure Consistent Pod Labeling for Inventory and Compliance
description: This rule checks for the presence of predefined labels on all pods within
  the Kubernetes cluster. Proper labeling should include identifiers for the application,
  environment, and owner. Consistent labels enable effective resource tracking and
  management, assist in enforcing security policies, and help in auditing for compliance
  purposes. A well-implemented labeling strategy reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and ensures that all deployed resources are accounted for and manageable
  under security policies.
rationale: Without consistent labeling of pods, it becomes challenging to track resources
  for inventory purposes, which may lead to unmanaged or orphaned resources. This
  can result in increased attack surface due to unmonitored deployments, and difficulty
  in meeting compliance requirements. Labels are crucial for organizing, tracking,
  and managing resources effectively, thus enhancing security by facilitating better
  access control and auditability.
