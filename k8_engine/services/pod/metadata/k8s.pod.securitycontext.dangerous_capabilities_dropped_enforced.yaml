rule_id: k8s.pod.securitycontext.dangerous_capabilities_dropped_enforced
service: pod
resource: securitycontext
requirement: Dangerous Capabilities Dropped Enforced
title: Enforce Pod Security by Dropping Dangerous Capabilities
description: This rule checks that the security context of Kubernetes pods is configured
  to drop dangerous Linux capabilities by default. Capabilities such as CAP_SYS_ADMIN,
  CAP_NET_ADMIN, and others are known to provide significant control over the host
  system if not properly restricted. Ensuring these are dropped helps mitigate risks
  associated with privilege escalation and enforces a principle of least privilege,
  enhancing the overall security posture of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Allowing pods to retain dangerous capabilities increases the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access. Attackers can exploit these capabilities to
  gain control over the host system or other pods, potentially leading to data breaches
  or service disruption.
