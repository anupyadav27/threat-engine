requirement: File Permissions Check
title: Secure File Permissions for Scheduler Configuration
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes scheduler configuration file has
  secure permissions set, typically allowing read and write access only to the root
  user. A secure configuration involves setting file permissions to '644' or stricter,
  preventing unauthorized users from modifying or viewing sensitive scheduler settings.
  Ensuring proper permissions helps protect the integrity and confidentiality of the
  scheduler configuration, aligning with CIS Kubernetes Benchmark recommendations.
rationale: Improper file permissions on the Kubernetes scheduler configuration file
  can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation by malicious users. This could
  allow attackers to alter scheduler behavior, potentially bypassing resource allocation
  constraints or disrupting service availability. Ensuring correct file permissions
  mitigates risks such as privilege escalation and unauthorized configuration changes.
