requirement: Address Check
title: Secure Scheduler Bind Address Configuration
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes scheduler is configured to bind
  only to a secure address, such as 127.0.0.1 or an internal IP range, instead of
  binding to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0). A secure configuration prevents unauthorized
  external access to the scheduler, which is critical for maintaining cluster integrity
  and security. Proper configuration ensures compliance with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
  and reduces risk by limiting potential entry points for attackers.
rationale: Misconfiguring the scheduler bind address can expose the Kubernetes scheduler
  to unauthorized network access, leading to potential denial-of-service attacks or
  unauthorized command execution. By limiting the bind address to localhost or a secure
  internal network, you reduce the attack surface and protect against external threats.
