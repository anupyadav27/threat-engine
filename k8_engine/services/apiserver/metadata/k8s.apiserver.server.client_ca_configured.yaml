rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.client_ca_configured
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Client Ca Configured
title: Ensure API Server Client Certificate Authentication is Enabled
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured with
  a valid client Certificate Authority (CA) bundle using the `--client-ca-file` flag.
  Proper configuration ensures that all client requests to the API server are authenticated
  through valid client certificates, thereby preventing unauthorized access. A correctly
  configured client CA enhances security by ensuring that only trusted clients can
  communicate with the API server, mitigating risks of impersonation and unauthorized
  actions within the cluster.
rationale: If the API server is not configured to verify client certificates using
  a Certificate Authority (CA), unauthorized users could gain access to the Kubernetes
  cluster by bypassing identity verification. This misconfiguration increases the
  risk of privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, and potential denial-of-service
  attacks. Additionally, it may lead to non-compliance with security standards and
  best practices.
