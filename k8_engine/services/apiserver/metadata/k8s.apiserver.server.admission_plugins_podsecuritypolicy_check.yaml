service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Plugins Podsecuritypolicy Check
title: Enforce PodSecurityPolicy via Admission Controller
description: This rule checks if the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller is enabled
  in the Kubernetes API server configuration. A well-configured PodSecurityPolicy
  defines a set of conditions that a pod must meet before it is allowed to run. This
  includes restrictions on running as root, using privileged containers, accessing
  sensitive host resources, and more. Proper configuration helps mitigate risks associated
  with privilege escalation and unauthorized resource access, thereby enhancing overall
  cluster security.
rationale: Without PodSecurityPolicy enforcement, malicious users can deploy pods
  with elevated privileges, access host resources, or execute arbitrary code, leading
  to potential data breaches or cluster compromise. Ensuring PodSecurityPolicy is
  enforced prevents privilege escalation and maintains cluster isolation.
