rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.secure_port_not_zero
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Secure Port Not Zero
title: Enforce Non-Zero Secure Port for API Server
description: This rule checks that the secure port for the Kubernetes API server is
  configured to a non-zero value, ensuring that secure HTTPS communication is enabled.
  A correctly configured secure port enhances security by encrypting data in transit
  and authenticating clients, thereby minimizing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  access. The default secure port is 6443, which should be specified to comply with
  security best practices and industry benchmarks like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If the secure port for the Kubernetes API server is set to zero, it disables
  secure communication, increasing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized
  access. This misconfiguration could allow attackers to intercept sensitive data
  or issue unauthorized commands, compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster.
