requirement: Upgrade Enabled
title: Enable Automatic Upgrades for Kube-Apiserver
description: This control checks whether automatic upgrades are enabled for the kube-apiserver
  component. Ensuring automatic upgrades are enabled helps maintain the security and
  stability of the Kubernetes control plane by applying the latest security patches
  and updates. A properly configured system minimizes the risk of exploitation from
  known vulnerabilities, ensures compliance with security standards, and reduces the
  operational overhead of manual upgrades.
rationale: Automatic upgrades for the kube-apiserver ensure that the system is consistently
  updated with the latest security patches and features, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities
  being exploited by attackers. Without automatic upgrades, outdated versions might
  expose the apiserver to known vulnerabilities, leading to potential data breaches
  or unauthorized access.
