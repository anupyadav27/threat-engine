service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Pod Authorization Mode Rbac Enabled
title: Enable RBAC for Pod Authorization in Kubernetes API Server
description: This rule ensures that the Kubernetes API server is configured with the
  RBAC authorization mode for pods. It checks the API server configuration to verify
  that the '--authorization-mode' flag includes 'RBAC'. Proper configuration of RBAC
  limits access to resources based on user roles and permissions, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access and actions within the cluster. This helps in adhering to
  security best practices and compliance standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enabled for pod authorization,
  there is a heightened risk of unauthorized users gaining access to Kubernetes resources.
  This can lead to privilege escalation attacks where attackers exploit elevated permissions
  to compromise the cluster. RBAC provides granular access control, ensuring only
  authorized users and services can access or modify resources.
