requirement: Https Only Configured
title: Enforce HTTPS for Kubernetes API Server Communication
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API Server is configured to accept
  only HTTPS connections. Proper configuration includes ensuring TLS certificates
  are correctly set up and used. By enforcing HTTPS, data in transit between the API
  Server and clients (such as kubectl, other cluster components, or external services)
  is encrypted, reducing the risk of eavesdropping and data tampering. A secure setup
  involves configuring the kube-apiserver with the '--tls-cert-file' and '--tls-private-key-file'
  flags to specify valid TLS certificates for secure communication.
rationale: Misconfiguring the Kubernetes API Server to allow non-HTTPS traffic exposes
  sensitive data to potential interception and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Attackers
  could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to the cluster, extract sensitive
  configuration or operational data, and compromise the integrity of the Kubernetes
  environment.
