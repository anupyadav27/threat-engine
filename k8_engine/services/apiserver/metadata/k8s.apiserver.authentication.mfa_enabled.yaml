title: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for API Server Access
description: This rule verifies that the Kubernetes API server is configured to enforce
  multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access attempts. A correct configuration
  involves integrating an external identity provider that supports MFA. This setup
  not only fortifies the API server against unauthorized access but also ensures compliance
  with industry standards and regulations. By requiring MFA, organizations can mitigate
  risks related to stolen or weak passwords while enhancing overall security posture.
rationale: Without multi-factor authentication (MFA), the Kubernetes API server is
  vulnerable to unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Attackers could
  exploit this to gain administrative access, manipulate workloads, or exfiltrate
  sensitive data. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second form
  of verification, significantly reducing the risk of credential-based attacks.
