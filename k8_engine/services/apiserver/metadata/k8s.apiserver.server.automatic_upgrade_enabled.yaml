rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.automatic_upgrade_enabled
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Automatic Upgrade Enabled
title: Enable Automatic Updates for Kube-Apiserver
description: This rule checks that automatic updates are enabled for the kube-apiserver.
  Proper configuration ensures that the server will automatically receive and apply
  critical security updates and patches. An up-to-date kube-apiserver reduces the
  attack surface by mitigating known vulnerabilities and exploits, thus enhancing
  the overall security posture of the Kubernetes cluster. A good configuration involves
  setting up update mechanisms that align with the cluster's operational policies
  while ensuring minimal disruption.
rationale: Without automatic updates, the kube-apiserver may run outdated versions
  that are susceptible to known vulnerabilities, leading to potential compromise of
  the cluster. Attackers often exploit outdated software to gain unauthorized access
  or execute malicious code. Keeping the kube-apiserver updated helps mitigate these
  risks by automatically applying security patches and updates.
