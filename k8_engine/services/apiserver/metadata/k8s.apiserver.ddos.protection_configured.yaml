resource: ddos
requirement: Protection Configured
title: Enable API Server Rate Limiting for DDoS Protection
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes API server has rate limiting configured
  to mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks. A correctly configured rate limiter controls
  the number of requests allowed per unit of time, preventing resource exhaustion
  and maintaining availability. Proper configuration involves setting flags such as
  --max-requests-inflight and --max-mutating-requests-inflight to reasonable values,
  thereby ensuring the API server can handle legitimate traffic while protecting against
  abuse.
rationale: Without rate limiting on the API server, a Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDoS) attack can overwhelm the server, leading to service disruptions. Attackers
  can exploit this by sending excessive requests, which could degrade performance
  and impact availability of the Kubernetes control plane.
