service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Ddos Protection Configured
title: Configure API Server for DDoS Mitigation
description: This control checks that DDoS mitigation configurations, such as rate
  limiting and resource quotas, are applied to the Kubernetes API server. Proper configuration
  ensures that the server can handle spikes in traffic without degradation. This involves
  setting appropriate flags and using network policies to limit request rates and
  sources. Implementing these configurations helps maintain availability and reliability,
  safeguarding the API server from being overwhelmed by malicious traffic.
rationale: Without proper DDoS protection, the Kubernetes API server is vulnerable
  to volumetric attacks, which can exhaust resources and lead to service disruptions.
  Attackers can exploit this to degrade cluster performance or render it unavailable,
  impacting application uptime and potentially leading to unauthorized access if the
  server is overwhelmed.
