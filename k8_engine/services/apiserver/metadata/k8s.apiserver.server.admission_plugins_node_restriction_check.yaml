rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.admission_plugins_node_restriction_check
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Plugins Node Restriction Check
title: Ensure NodeRestriction Admission Plugin is Enabled
description: This rule checks that the NodeRestriction admission plugin is configured
  on the Kubernetes API server. The NodeRestriction plugin limits the nodes' ability
  to modify or create resources to only those that are bound to the node itself, reducing
  the risk of a node impersonating another node or accessing unauthorized resources.
  Proper configuration ensures nodes cannot access or modify resources beyond their
  intended scope, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
rationale: If the NodeRestriction admission plugin is not enabled, nodes could obtain
  unauthorized access to resources by impersonating other nodes or service accounts,
  leading to potential data breaches and privilege escalation attacks.
