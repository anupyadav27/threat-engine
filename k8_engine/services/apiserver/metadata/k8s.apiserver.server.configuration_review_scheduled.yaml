requirement: Configuration Review Scheduled
title: Schedule Regular Configuration Reviews for Kube-Apiserver
description: This control checks whether a regular review schedule is in place for
  the kube-apiserver configurations. A good configuration review process involves
  periodic assessment and validation against security best practices, ensuring settings
  align with security policies and regulations. This helps in identifying and mitigating
  potential security risks proactively, maintaining an optimal security posture and
  compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfigured kube-apiserver settings can lead to vulnerabilities such
  as unauthorized access, data breaches, and privilege escalation attacks. Regularly
  reviewing configurations helps detect and rectify misconfigurations, reducing the
  risk of security incidents.
