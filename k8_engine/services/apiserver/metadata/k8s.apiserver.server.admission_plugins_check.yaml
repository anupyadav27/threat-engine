service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Plugins Check
title: Enforce Mandatory Admission Plugins in Kube-Apiserver
description: This check ensures that the Kubernetes API server has critical admission
  plugins such as 'NamespaceLifecycle', 'NodeRestriction', and 'PodSecurityPolicy'
  enabled. These plugins help enforce namespace access controls, restrict node operations,
  and apply security policies to pods. Proper configuration reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and enforces compliance with security policies, thereby enhancing overall
  cluster security.
rationale: Admission plugins in Kubernetes control and validate requests before they
  persist in the cluster. Misconfiguring them can lead to unauthorized resource creation,
  privilege escalation, and bypass of security policies. Attackers could exploit these
  misconfigurations to deploy malicious workloads or access sensitive resources.
