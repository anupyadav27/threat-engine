service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Request Timeout Check
title: Configure API Server Request Timeout to Prevent Denial of Service
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes API server has a request timeout configured
  that adheres to security best practices. A well-configured timeout ensures that
  requests are processed within a reasonable period, freeing resources and preventing
  potential DoS attacks. The Kubernetes API server should have the `--request-timeout`
  flag set to a value that balances allowing legitimate operations while mitigating
  resource exhaustion risks. An optimal configuration reduces the attack surface and
  aligns with compliance standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Improperly configured request timeouts can lead to Denial of Service (DoS)
  attacks by allowing excessive allocation of resources to long-running requests.
  Attackers could exploit this by sending numerous requests that occupy server resources,
  potentially leading to exhaustion and service disruption.
