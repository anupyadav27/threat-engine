rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.client_ca_file_presence_check
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Client Ca File Presence Check
title: Ensure API Server Has a Configured Client CA File
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes API server has a valid Client Certificate
  Authority (CA) file configured. The Client CA file is essential for authenticating
  client credentials that attempt to communicate with the API server. Proper configuration
  ensures that only clients with valid certificates, issued by trusted authorities,
  can access the cluster's API. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and helps
  maintain the security of the cluster by enforcing strong client authentication.
rationale: An improperly configured or missing Client CA file allows malicious users
  to spoof identities and gain unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster by bypassing
  client certificate authentication. This can lead to data breaches, service disruptions,
  and unauthorized resource modifications.
