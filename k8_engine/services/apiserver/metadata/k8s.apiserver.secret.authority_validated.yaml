resource: secret
requirement: Authority Validated
title: Ensure Valid Authentication for API Server Secrets
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured to validate
  the authority of requests to access secrets. Proper configuration involves ensuring
  that authentication mechanisms such as RBAC are correctly implemented to verify
  that only authorized entities can access secrets. A secure configuration helps prevent
  unauthorized access and mitigates the risk of sensitive data leaks.
rationale: If API server secrets are not properly authenticated, attackers could exploit
  vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This can lead to
  data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, and potential privilege escalation
  within the Kubernetes cluster.
