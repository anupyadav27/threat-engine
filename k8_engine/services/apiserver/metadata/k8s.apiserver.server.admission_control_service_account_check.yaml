rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.admission_control_service_account_check
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Control Service Account Check
title: Enforce Service Account Admission Control
description: This control ensures that the Kubernetes API server has the admission
  control plugin 'ServiceAccount' enabled. When properly configured, it verifies that
  all pods are associated with a valid service account, preventing the execution of
  pods with default or no account settings. This mitigates risks associated with default
  permissions and unauthorized resource access, aligning with security best practices
  and compliance standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper admission control for service accounts, unauthorized or
  rogue services can impersonate existing accounts, potentially gaining access to
  sensitive resources. This elevates the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized
  data access, compromising the cluster's security integrity.
