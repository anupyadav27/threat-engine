title: Ensure API Server Audit Logging is Enabled
description: This control checks that audit logging is enabled on the Kubernetes API
  server. Proper configuration includes setting appropriate log levels, defining audit
  policies, and ensuring logs are securely stored and accessible for review. Enabling
  audit logging enhances security by providing visibility into API requests and responses,
  helping detect anomalies and unauthorized access attempts. It is a foundational
  security measure to monitor and investigate API activity.
rationale: Without audit logging enabled, unauthorized access and malicious activities
  within the Kubernetes cluster may go undetected. Audit logs provide a detailed record
  of interactions with the API server, which is crucial for identifying and investigating
  security incidents, monitoring access patterns, and ensuring compliance with security
  policies.
