requirement: Access Disabled
title: Disable SSH Access to Kubernetes API Server
description: This control checks that SSH access to the Kubernetes API server is disabled.
  Proper configuration involves ensuring that no SSH keys or SSH services are running
  on the API server. SSH access should be replaced with secure, audited API calls
  and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage and monitor interactions with the
  API server. This enhances security by preventing unauthorized command execution
  and data manipulation, maintaining compliance with security best practices and benchmarks
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Allowing SSH access to the Kubernetes API server poses significant security
  risks, including unauthorized access and potential control over the cluster. Attackers
  could exploit SSH access to execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate sensitive data,
  and disrupt cluster operations. Disabling SSH access mitigates these risks by enforcing
  strict access control and reducing the attack surface.
