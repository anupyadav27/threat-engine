service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Tls Certificates Configured
title: Ensure TLS Certificates Are Properly Configured for Kube-apiserver
description: This control checks that the kube-apiserver is configured with valid
  and correctly implemented TLS certificates. Proper configuration includes ensuring
  that the certificates are signed by a trusted certificate authority, have not expired,
  and match the server's hostname. This helps to encrypt data in transit, protecting
  against unauthorized access and eavesdropping, thereby ensuring compliance with
  security best practices and standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfigured TLS certificates on the kube-apiserver could allow attackers
  to intercept, modify, or eavesdrop on sensitive data in transit, potentially leading
  to data breaches or man-in-the-middle attacks. This can compromise the confidentiality,
  integrity, and authenticity of communication between clients and the Kubernetes
  API server.
