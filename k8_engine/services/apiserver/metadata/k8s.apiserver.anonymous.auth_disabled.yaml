rule_id: k8s.apiserver.anonymous.auth_disabled
service: apiserver
resource: anonymous
requirement: Auth Disabled
title: Disable Anonymous Authentication on Kube-apiserver
description: This rule checks that the Kube-apiserver is configured with anonymous
  authentication disabled by ensuring the `--anonymous-auth` flag is set to `false`.
  A secure configuration prevents unauthenticated requests, enforcing that all interactions
  with the API server are from verified users. This enhances security by ensuring
  that access to the cluster is controlled and monitored, thereby reducing attack
  vectors.
rationale: Enabling anonymous authentication on the Kube-apiserver allows unauthenticated
  access, which can lead to unauthorized users performing actions on the cluster.
  This misconfiguration can be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive
  data, modify cluster configurations, or disrupt operations. Disabling anonymous
  authentication is crucial to ensure that all API requests are properly authenticated,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches.
