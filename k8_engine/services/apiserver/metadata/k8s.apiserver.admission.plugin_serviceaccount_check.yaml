rule_id: k8s.apiserver.admission.plugin_serviceaccount_check
service: apiserver
resource: admission
requirement: Plugin Serviceaccount Check
title: Enforce ServiceAccount Admission Control in API Server
description: This rule checks whether the ServiceAccount admission plugin is enabled
  and properly configured in the Kubernetes API server. The ServiceAccount admission
  plugin ensures that pods are assigned service accounts, which are crucial for managing
  pod permissions and access control. Proper configuration includes verifying that
  each pod has a service account and that tokens are handled securely. This helps
  maintain the principle of least privilege and restricts unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources.
rationale: Misconfiguring the ServiceAccount admission plugin can lead to unauthorized
  access and privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster. Without proper service
  account management, attackers may exploit service account tokens to gain unauthorized
  access to cluster resources, potentially leading to data breaches or lateral movement
  across the cluster.
