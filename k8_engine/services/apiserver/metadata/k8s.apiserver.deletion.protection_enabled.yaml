service: apiserver
resource: deletion
requirement: Protection Enabled
title: Enable Deletion Protection on Kubernetes API Server
description: This check verifies that deletion protection is enabled for the Kubernetes
  API server. A properly configured API server with deletion protection ensures that
  critical resources cannot be easily removed without appropriate permissions and
  review. This security measure helps maintain the integrity and availability of the
  Kubernetes control plane, preventing unauthorized users or malicious insiders from
  deleting resources that could disrupt cluster operations. The configuration aligns
  with best practices outlined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfigured deletion protection on the Kubernetes API server can lead
  to accidental or malicious removal of critical server components, potentially causing
  disruptions in service availability and enabling denial-of-service attacks. By ensuring
  deletion protection is enabled, we mitigate the risk of unauthorized deletions that
  might exploit improper access controls or vulnerabilities.
