service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Plugins Always Pull Images Set
title: Enforce AlwaysPullImages Admission Controller
description: This control checks whether the AlwaysPullImages admission plugin is
  enabled in the Kubernetes API server configuration. When enabled, this setting ensures
  that the kubelet always pulls the image from the registry when starting containers,
  which helps maintain up-to-date deployments and prevents the execution of stale
  or unauthorized images. This is crucial for environments where image updates are
  frequent or security patches are rapidly deployed. Enforcing this policy mitigates
  risks associated with cached images and ensures compliance with security best practices.
rationale: Without AlwaysPullImages, Kubernetes might run images from the local cache
  instead of pulling the latest version from the registry. This can lead to running
  outdated or compromised images, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and allowing
  potential attacks such as executing unverified code or exploiting known vulnerabilities
  in older image versions.
