resource: server
requirement: Insecure Port Disabled
title: Disable Kube-apiserver Insecure Port
description: This control checks that the kube-apiserver has its insecure port disabled
  by verifying that the `--insecure-port=0` flag is set. A correctly configured kube-apiserver
  uses secure communication protocols such as HTTPS to ensure all API requests are
  authenticated and encrypted, thus protecting sensitive data and cluster operations
  from unauthorized access and interception.
rationale: Leaving the kube-apiserver's insecure port enabled poses a significant
  security risk as it bypasses authentication and encryption, allowing unauthorized
  access to the Kubernetes API. Attackers could exploit this to gain control over
  the entire cluster, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized
  resource usage.
