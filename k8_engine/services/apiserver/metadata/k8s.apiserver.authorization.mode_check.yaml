service: apiserver
resource: authorization
requirement: Mode Check
title: Enforce RBAC and Node Authorization Modes
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured to use
  secure authorization modes, specifically Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Node
  authorization. By ensuring these modes are enabled, the cluster implements granular
  access control policies and authenticates node requests effectively. A correct configuration
  enforces the principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches.
rationale: Misconfigured authorization modes in the Kubernetes API server can lead
  to unauthorized access to cluster resources. Without proper authorization modes
  like RBAC, malicious actors could exploit overly permissive access controls, leading
  to privilege escalation and unauthorized data access.
