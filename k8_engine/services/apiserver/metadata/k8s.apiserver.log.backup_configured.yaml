service: apiserver
resource: log
requirement: Backup Configured
title: Ensure Backup of Kubernetes API Server Logs
description: This rule checks whether backups for Kubernetes API server logs are configured
  and operational. A well-configured backup ensures that logs are stored securely
  offsite, protecting them from local system failures and unauthorized tampering.
  This control helps in maintaining an immutable record of API server activity, which
  is critical for identifying unusual patterns, unauthorized access attempts, and
  ensuring compliance with industry standards and audit requirements.
rationale: Failure to configure regular backups for Kubernetes API server logs can
  lead to loss of crucial audit trails and system activity records, hindering incident
  response and forensic investigations. An attacker exploiting this misconfiguration
  could erase traces of unauthorized access or malicious activities, complicating
  detection and accountability.
