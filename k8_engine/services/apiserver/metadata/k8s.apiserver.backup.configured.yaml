title: Ensure Scheduled Backups of Kubernetes API Server Configuration
description: This control checks that a regular backup schedule for the Kubernetes
  API server configuration is in place and properly implemented. A good configuration
  involves automated, periodic backups stored securely and offsite, with encryption
  enabled to protect data integrity and confidentiality. Such practices help ensure
  quick recovery from incidents, maintain service availability, and protect against
  data loss, meeting compliance requirements and industry best practices.
rationale: Without regular backups of the Kubernetes API server configuration, recovery
  from data corruption or accidental deletion can be severely delayed. This increases
  the risk of prolonged service outages and potential exposure to security vulnerabilities
  if configuration changes cannot be reverted quickly. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  or gain unauthorized access, especially if sensitive configurations are lost or
  mismanaged.
