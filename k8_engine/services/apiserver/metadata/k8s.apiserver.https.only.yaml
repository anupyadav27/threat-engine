title: Enforce HTTPS for Kubernetes API Server
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured to accept
  only HTTPS connections, ensuring that all data transmitted between clients and the
  server is encrypted. A correctly configured API server uses TLS certificates to
  establish secure communication channels, preventing eavesdropping and data tampering.
  Proper configuration involves setting the '--secure-port' flag, ensuring no plain
  HTTP ports are open, and using valid TLS certificates. This helps maintain confidentiality
  and integrity of the data, aligning with security best practices and compliance
  requirements.
rationale: Misconfiguring the API server to allow non-HTTPS traffic can expose sensitive
  data to interception and unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit this to perform
  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, gain unauthorized access to cluster resources,
  and compromise the entire Kubernetes environment.
