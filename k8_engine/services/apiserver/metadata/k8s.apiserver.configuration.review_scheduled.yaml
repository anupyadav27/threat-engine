requirement: Review Scheduled
title: Regularly Review and Update Kube-apiserver Configuration
description: This control checks that the Kube-apiserver configuration is reviewed
  and updated regularly. It ensures that security settings, such as authentication
  and authorization configurations, network policies, and audit logging, adhere to
  industry best practices. A well-maintained configuration helps mitigate risks by
  preventing potential vulnerabilities from being exploited and ensuring compliance
  with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Kube-apiserver acts as the central management point for the entire Kubernetes
  cluster. If its configuration is outdated or misconfigured, it could lead to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, or denial of service attacks. Regular reviews ensure that
  security patches are applied and configurations are aligned with the latest security
  policies, reducing the risk of exploitation.
