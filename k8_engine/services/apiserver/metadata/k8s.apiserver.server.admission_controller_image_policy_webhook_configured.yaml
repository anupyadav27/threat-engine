rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.admission_controller_image_policy_webhook_configured
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Controller Image Policy Webhook Configured
title: Enforce Image Policy with Admission Controller Webhook
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server has the Image Policy
  Webhook admission controller configured. It validates that the webhook is active
  and properly set to enforce image policies, ensuring that only images meeting specific
  security criteria are allowed to run. Proper configuration helps prevent the deployment
  of unsafe images, thereby enforcing compliance with security policies and reducing
  risks associated with untrusted container images.
rationale: Without an Image Policy Webhook, there is a risk of running unauthorized
  or potentially malicious container images. Attackers could exploit this to deploy
  vulnerable or compromised images, leading to supply chain attacks or privilege escalation
  within the cluster. Configuring this ensures that only vetted and compliant images
  are allowed, reducing the attack surface and maintaining cluster integrity.
