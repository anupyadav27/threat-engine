resource: server
requirement: Rate Limiting Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Rate Limiting on Kubernetes API Server
description: This control checks whether rate limiting is enabled and properly configured
  on the Kubernetes API server. A valid configuration includes setting request limits
  based on client IP or user, ensuring that excessive requests are throttled or rejected.
  This validation involves examining the API server's configuration flags such as
  '--max-requests-inflight' and '--max-mutating-requests-inflight'. Proper configuration
  reduces the risk of DoS attacks by controlling the load on the server, thus maintaining
  the availability and performance of the Kubernetes control plane.
rationale: Without rate limiting, the Kubernetes API server is vulnerable to Denial
  of Service (DoS) attacks, where a malicious actor could overwhelm the server with
  requests, leading to degraded performance or a complete outage. Properly configured
  rate limiting helps mitigate the risk of resource exhaustion, ensuring availability
  and responsiveness of the API server under load, and helps prevent unauthorized
  access attempts by limiting the number of requests from potentially malicious sources.
