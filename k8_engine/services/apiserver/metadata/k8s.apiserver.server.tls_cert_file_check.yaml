service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Tls Cert File Check
title: Ensure API Server TLS Certificate is Properly Configured
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured with
  a valid TLS certificate. Proper TLS configuration ensures that all communication
  to the API server is encrypted, protecting the integrity and confidentiality of
  data in transit. A good configuration includes using certificates signed by a trusted
  Certificate Authority (CA) with appropriate expiration dates and ensuring that the
  API server's `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` flags are correctly
  set. This mitigates risks associated with eavesdropping and tampering by ensuring
  encrypted communication channels.
rationale: If the TLS certificate for the Kubernetes API server is misconfigured or
  absent, sensitive communication can be exposed to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
  This could allow attackers to intercept, modify, or spoof API requests, leading
  to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to cluster resources.
