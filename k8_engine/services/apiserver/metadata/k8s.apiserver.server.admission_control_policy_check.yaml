rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.admission_control_policy_check
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Admission Control Policy Check
title: Enable and Configure Mandatory Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks that specific, mandatory admission controllers are enabled
  and correctly configured in the kube-apiserver. Proper configuration of admission
  controllers like 'PodSecurity', 'ResourceQuota', and 'NodeRestriction' ensures that
  pods adhere to security policies, resources are not over-allocated, and nodes are
  protected from unauthorized scheduling. This setup minimizes the risk of privilege
  escalation, resource abuse, and policy violations, thus maintaining a secure and
  compliant Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Admission controllers act as gatekeepers for the Kubernetes API, intercepting
  requests to ensure they meet certain security and compliance criteria before resources
  are created, updated, or deleted. Without them, attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  to escalate privileges, bypass security policies, or deploy insecure workloads.
  Admission controllers can enforce policies such as PodSecurity, resource quotas,
  and more, providing a critical layer of defense against unauthorized or harmful
  changes.
