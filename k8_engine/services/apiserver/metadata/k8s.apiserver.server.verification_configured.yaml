rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.verification_configured
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Verification Configured
title: Enable and Configure API Server Request Verification
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes API server has request verification
  mechanisms properly configured, including TLS certificates and client authentication.
  A secure configuration ensures that the API server only accepts requests from authenticated
  and authorized users, which mitigates risks such as unauthorized access and impersonation
  attacks. Proper verification includes setting up valid server certificates and enabling
  mutual TLS (mTLS) to authenticate clients.
rationale: Misconfigured or disabled request verification in the Kubernetes API server
  can expose the cluster to unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle attacks. Without
  proper verification, an attacker can intercept or forge API requests, leading to
  potential data breaches or unauthorized operations within the cluster.
