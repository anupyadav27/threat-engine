resource: server
requirement: Admission Plugins Event Rate Limit Set
title: Enforce Event Rate Limiting in Admission Control
description: This control ensures that the Kubernetes API server has the EventRateLimit
  admission plugin enabled and properly configured. It checks for the presence of
  rate limiting settings within the admission controller configuration. A well-configured
  event rate limit prevents excessive API server load by capping the number of requests
  that can be processed. This contributes to maintaining service stability, protecting
  against DoS attacks, and complying with security standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark. A good configuration involves setting appropriate limits based on cluster
  size and traffic patterns.
rationale: Without proper event rate limiting, the Kubernetes API server is vulnerable
  to denial-of-service attacks where malicious actors can overwhelm the server with
  a high volume of requests. This can lead to degraded performance, service outages,
  or even system crashes, compromising the overall security and availability of the
  cluster.
