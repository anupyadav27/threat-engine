requirement: Strong Mechanism Enabled
title: Enable Strong Authentication Mechanisms for API Server
description: This control checks whether strong authentication mechanisms, such as
  client certificates, OpenID Connect, or webhook token authentication, are enabled
  for the Kubernetes API server. Proper configuration ensures that only authenticated
  and authorized users can interact with the API server, significantly reducing the
  risk of unauthorized access. Strong mechanisms help enforce secure user identity
  verification, which is critical for maintaining the security posture of the Kubernetes
  cluster and complying with industry standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If strong authentication mechanisms are not enabled for the Kubernetes
  API server, it could lead to unauthorized access by attackers exploiting weak or
  improperly configured authentication methods. This can result in compromised cluster
  integrity, unauthorized data access, and the potential for lateral movement within
  the cluster.
