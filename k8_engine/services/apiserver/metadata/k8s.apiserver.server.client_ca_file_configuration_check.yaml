resource: server
requirement: Client Ca File Configuration Check
title: Ensure Client CA File is Configured for API Server Authentication
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API Server is configured with
  a valid Client CA file, which is essential for authenticating client certificates.
  Proper configuration ensures that only clients with valid certificates, signed by
  a trusted Certificate Authority, can communicate with the API Server. This setup
  helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users and services
  can perform actions within the cluster, thus maintaining the security boundary of
  the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: If the Client CA file is not properly configured on the Kubernetes API
  Server, there is a risk of unauthorized access due to the inability to authenticate
  client certificates. This misconfiguration can lead to potential man-in-the-middle
  attacks or unauthorized data access, compromising the integrity and confidentiality
  of the Kubernetes cluster.
