resource: rate
requirement: Limiting Enabled
title: Enable API Server Request Rate Limiting
description: This control checks whether rate limiting is enabled on the Kubernetes
  API server to ensure that it is configured according to security best practices.
  A proper rate limiting configuration ensures that the API server can handle requests
  efficiently without being overwhelmed by excessive requests, whether intentional
  or accidental. This helps to mitigate the risk of DoS attacks by limiting the number
  of requests an entity can make within a specified time frame, thus preserving the
  availability and reliability of the Kubernetes control plane.
rationale: If rate limiting on the Kubernetes API server is not properly configured,
  it may become susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. These attacks can
  overwhelm the API server, leading to degraded performance or complete unavailability
  of the cluster's control plane. This can prevent legitimate requests from being
  fulfilled, potentially impacting application availability and security monitoring.
