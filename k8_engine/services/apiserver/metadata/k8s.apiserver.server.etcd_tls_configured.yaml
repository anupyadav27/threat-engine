rule_id: k8s.apiserver.server.etcd_tls_configured
service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Etcd Tls Configured
title: Ensure etcd Communication Uses TLS Encryption
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured to use
  TLS for communication with the etcd datastore. A secure configuration involves specifying
  TLS certificates and keys for both the API server and etcd in their respective configuration
  files. Proper TLS setup ensures that all data exchanges between these components
  are encrypted, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data. A misconfiguration
  could lead to exposure of sensitive information and non-compliance with security
  standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without TLS encryption between the Kubernetes API server and etcd, sensitive
  data transmitted, including secrets, could be intercepted by unauthorized parties.
  An attacker with network access could perform man-in-the-middle attacks, leading
  to data breaches or unauthorized modifications. TLS ensures that the data is encrypted
  in transit, thereby protecting against such attack vectors.
