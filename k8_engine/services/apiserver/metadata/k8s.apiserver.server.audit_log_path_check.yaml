resource: server
requirement: Audit Log Path Check
title: Ensure Audit Log Path is Configured for Kube-Apiserver
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured with
  a valid audit log path, ensuring that all audit events are logged and stored securely.
  A correctly set audit log path enables the capture of all pertinent API server requests
  and responses, facilitating complete visibility into cluster operations. This helps
  in identifying unauthorized access attempts, changes to cluster resources, and ensures
  adherence to compliance frameworks like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A good configuration
  includes specifying a non-default, secure location for storing audit logs, with
  appropriate access controls to prevent tampering.
rationale: Without a properly configured audit log path, Kubernetes cannot effectively
  capture and store audit logs, which are critical for forensic investigations, compliance
  audits, and detecting unauthorized actions. Misconfiguration may lead to missing
  logs, making it difficult to trace actions performed within the cluster, thereby
  increasing the risk of undetected malicious activity or compliance violations.
