service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Audit Policy Verification
title: Enforce Comprehensive Audit Policy in API Server
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API server has a comprehensive
  audit policy configured. It ensures that all relevant API server requests are logged,
  capturing sufficient detail to enable effective monitoring and incident response.
  A well-configured audit policy helps security teams detect unauthorized access,
  potential misconfigurations, and policy violations. The policy should cover a range
  of events including authentication, authorization, and resource modifications, thereby
  improving visibility and aiding compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without a properly configured audit policy, malicious activities could
  go undetected, leading to potential breaches. Attackers could exploit this to perform
  unauthorized actions without leaving a trace. An effective audit policy helps in
  tracking access and modification events, crucial for identifying and responding
  to suspicious activities and ensuring accountability.
