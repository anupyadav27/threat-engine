service: apiserver
resource: server
requirement: Secure Configuration Enforced
title: Ensure API Server Secure Configuration Parameters
description: This rule checks the Kubernetes API server's configuration to ensure
  that security best practices are enforced. It validates settings such as authentication
  mechanisms, access control policies, and network policies. A secure configuration
  should enforce TLS encryption, use RBAC for access control, and disable insecure
  ports. These measures protect the API server from unauthorized access and potential
  exploits, maintaining the integrity and availability of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: If the API server is not properly secured, it can be vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and attacks such as privilege escalation, data breaches, and denial of service.
  Misconfigurations can lead to exposure of sensitive data and control over cluster
  operations, making it critical to ensure all configurations adhere to security best
  practices.
