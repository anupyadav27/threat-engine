requirement: Configuration Applied
title: Enforce Secure API Server Configuration
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes API Server is configured with
  security best practices. Key configurations include enforcing TLS for all communications,
  enabling secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and restricting access
  to sensitive API endpoints. Proper configuration minimizes the attack surface and
  ensures only authenticated and authorized entities can interact with the API server,
  thereby securing the cluster management plane.
rationale: A misconfigured API Server can be exploited to bypass authentication and
  authorization controls, allowing unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster.
  Attack vectors include API server exposure to public networks, lack of transport
  layer security (TLS), and improper authentication methods, all of which can lead
  to data breaches and unauthorized manipulation of workloads.
