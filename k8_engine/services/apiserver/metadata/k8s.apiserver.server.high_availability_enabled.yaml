requirement: High Availability Enabled
title: Ensure Kubernetes API Server High Availability Configuration
description: This check ensures that the Kubernetes API server is configured in a
  high availability (HA) setup. A proper HA configuration typically involves running
  multiple instances of the API server in a load-balanced environment, preventing
  a single instance failure from affecting cluster operations. This setup enhances
  security by maintaining continuous availability and reducing the risk of downtime,
  which could otherwise lead to vulnerabilities being exploited during periods when
  the cluster is unresponsive.
rationale: Without high availability, a single point of failure in the API server
  can disrupt the entire cluster's operations, potentially exposing it to denial-of-service
  attacks. High availability ensures redundancy and resilience, mitigating risks of
  service disruption and unauthorized access during server downtimes or attacks.
