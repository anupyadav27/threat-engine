requirement: Logging Enabled
title: Enable and Configure API Server Audit Logging
description: This rule checks the configuration of audit logging on the Kubernetes
  API server to ensure it is enabled and properly set up. A good configuration involves
  specifying an audit policy that captures critical events, including access and modification
  actions. This setup allows security teams to monitor and investigate suspicious
  activities, thus enhancing the detection and response capabilities against potential
  threats. Proper audit logging is essential for forensic analysis, compliance with
  standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, and maintaining a robust security posture.
rationale: Without audit logging enabled on the Kubernetes API server, security incidents
  may go undetected as there would be no record of access and actions taken by users.
  This lack of visibility can allow malicious activities like unauthorized access,
  privilege escalation, and data exfiltration to occur without detection, increasing
  the risk of breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards.
