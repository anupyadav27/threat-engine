service: apiserver
resource: high
requirement: Availability Configured
title: Ensure API Server High Availability Configuration
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes API server is configured for high
  availability, requiring multiple replicas distributed across different nodes. A
  proper high availability setup ensures that if one instance fails, others can continue
  to serve requests. This configuration is crucial for minimizing downtime, preventing
  service disruption, and ensuring continuous access to the Kubernetes control plane,
  thereby enhancing both the reliability and security posture of the cluster.
rationale: A misconfigured API server high availability setup can lead to a single
  point of failure, making the Kubernetes cluster vulnerable to downtime and potential
  denial-of-service attacks. Ensuring high availability is crucial for maintaining
  the reliability and security of the cluster by distributing the load across multiple
  instances and preventing service disruption.
