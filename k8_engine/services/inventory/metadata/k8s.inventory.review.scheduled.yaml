title: Regularly Scheduled Kubernetes Resource Inventory Review
description: This control checks that a schedule is in place for reviewing the entire
  Kubernetes resource inventory, including deployments, services, and configurations.
  Regular reviews help identify unauthorized changes, detect configuration drift,
  and ensure compliance with security policies. A well-configured schedule ensures
  these reviews are conducted consistently, reducing the risk of exposure to vulnerabilities
  and maintaining security posture.
rationale: Without regular inventory reviews, misconfigurations or unauthorized changes
  in Kubernetes resources could go unnoticed, increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities
  and compliance issues. Attackers could exploit these unnoticed changes to gain unauthorized
  access or escalate privileges within the cluster.
