requirement: Rate Limiting Configured
title: Implement Rate Limiting in Kubernetes Service Mesh
description: This control checks that rate limiting is configured in the Kubernetes
  service mesh. A correctly implemented rate limiting policy defines thresholds for
  requests, which helps prevent resource exhaustion and service disruptions. Proper
  configuration involves setting request limits based on service capacity and expected
  load, thereby enhancing resilience against DoS attacks and aiding in traffic management.
  It ensures services are not overwhelmed and maintain availability under varying
  loads.
rationale: Without rate limiting, a Kubernetes service mesh is vulnerable to denial-of-service
  (DoS) attacks, where excessive requests can overwhelm services, leading to degradation
  or complete service outage. Rate limiting helps mitigate these risks by controlling
  the number of requests within a time period, thus reducing potential abuse and ensuring
  consistent service performance.
