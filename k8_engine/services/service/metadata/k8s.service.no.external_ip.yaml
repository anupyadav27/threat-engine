rule_id: k8s.service.no.external_ip
service: service
resource: 'no'
requirement: External Ip
title: Prohibit External IPs on Kubernetes Services
description: This control checks that Kubernetes services do not have external IPs
  assigned, which could unintentionally expose them to the internet. Best practices
  dictate that external traffic should be routed through controlled ingress points
  like LoadBalancers or Ingress controllers, which provide additional layers of security
  such as authentication, SSL termination, and traffic filtering. By ensuring no external
  IPs are assigned directly to services, this rule helps to maintain a secure boundary
  and prevent unauthorized access.
rationale: Allowing external IPs on Kubernetes services can expose internal services
  to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Attackers could exploit open external IPs to bypass network controls and launch
  attacks directly against the cluster's services.
