service: service
resource: mesh
requirement: Traffic Control Enabled
title: Enforce Traffic Management in Service Mesh
description: This rule checks that traffic management is enabled within the Kubernetes
  service mesh. Proper configuration includes setting up ingress and egress control,
  rate limiting, and circuit breaking. These controls help prevent unauthorized access,
  manage traffic loads, and mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks. Ensuring
  traffic control is enabled and properly configured is crucial to maintaining network
  integrity and regulatory compliance.
rationale: Without proper traffic control in a service mesh, services may become vulnerable
  to unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and data breaches. Traffic management
  ensures that only legitimate traffic is routed, reducing the attack surface and
  supporting the enforcement of security policies across microservices.
