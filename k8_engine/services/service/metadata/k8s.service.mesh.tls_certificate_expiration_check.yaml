resource: mesh
requirement: Tls Certificate Expiration Check
title: Ensure TLS Certificate Expiration is Monitored in Service Mesh
description: This control checks that all TLS certificates in use by the Kubernetes
  service mesh have a monitoring mechanism to track expiration dates and trigger renewals
  before expiry. A well-configured setup includes automated alerts and renewal processes
  to ensure continuous encryption of traffic within the mesh. This prevents potential
  disruptions, mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks, and ensures compliance with security
  standards such as PCI DSS and CIS Benchmarks.
rationale: TLS certificates are critical for encrypting data in transit within a Kubernetes
  service mesh. If certificates expire without being renewed, encrypted communications
  can be disrupted or fall back to insecure defaults, leading to exposure of sensitive
  data. Attackers can exploit expired certificates to perform man-in-the-middle attacks
  or impersonate services within the mesh.
