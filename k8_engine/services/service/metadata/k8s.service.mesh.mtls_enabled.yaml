requirement: Mtls Enabled
title: Enforce mTLS in Kubernetes Service Mesh for Secure Communication
description: This rule checks that mutual TLS (mTLS) is enabled within the Kubernetes
  service mesh, ensuring that all communications between services are authenticated
  and encrypted. Proper mTLS configuration requires both client and server to authenticate
  each other using certificates, thus securing data in transit and mitigating the
  risk of eavesdropping or unauthorized data access. This control is crucial for compliance
  with security standards and industry best practices, contributing to a robust security
  posture by ensuring encrypted service-to-service communication.
rationale: Without mutual TLS (mTLS), data transmitted between services in a Kubernetes
  service mesh can be intercepted or manipulated by malicious actors. This misconfiguration
  exposes services to man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches,
  undermining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information and communications.
