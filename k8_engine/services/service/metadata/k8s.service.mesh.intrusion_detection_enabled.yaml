title: Enable Intrusion Detection in Kubernetes Service Mesh
description: This control checks if intrusion detection systems (IDS) are enabled
  and properly configured within the Kubernetes service mesh. An effective IDS monitors
  network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats, providing alerts
  and logs that help in identifying and mitigating attacks. Proper IDS configuration
  should align with best practices, such as monitoring ingress and egress traffic,
  and integrating with alerting mechanisms. This enhances security by detecting unauthorized
  access attempts and preventing potential intrusions, thereby maintaining compliance
  with industry standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without intrusion detection enabled in the service mesh, Kubernetes clusters
  are vulnerable to undetected attacks such as lateral movement, data exfiltration,
  and unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise
  cluster integrity and confidentiality, leading to significant security breaches
  and compliance violations.
