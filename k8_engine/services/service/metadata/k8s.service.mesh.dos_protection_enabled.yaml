requirement: Dos Protection Enabled
title: Enable DoS Protection in Service Mesh
description: This control verifies that DoS protection measures are enabled within
  the Kubernetes service mesh. It checks for configurations such as rate limiting
  and circuit breaking that are essential to mitigate the risk of resource exhaustion
  due to excessive requests. A properly configured service mesh will limit the impact
  of DoS attacks, ensuring that services remain available and performant even under
  attack. The configuration should follow best practices, such as those outlined in
  the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, to ensure comprehensive protection.
rationale: Without DoS protection, the service mesh is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service
  attacks, which can overwhelm services, degrade performance, and lead to service
  outages. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to disrupt service availability,
  impacting both application performance and user experience.
