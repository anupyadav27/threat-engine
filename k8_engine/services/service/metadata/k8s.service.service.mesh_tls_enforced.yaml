requirement: Mesh Tls Enforced
title: Enforce Mutual TLS in Kubernetes Service Mesh
description: This control ensures that mutual TLS is enforced within the Kubernetes
  service mesh, verifying that all communication between services is encrypted and
  authenticated. It checks for the presence of mTLS configurations in the service
  mesh, such as Istio or Linkerd, ensuring they are set to require encryption and
  mutual authentication. Enforcing mTLS helps in preventing eavesdropping and tampering
  of data in transit, thereby securing the communication channel and maintaining the
  integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between services.
rationale: Without mutual TLS (mTLS), data transmitted between services within the
  mesh can be intercepted or altered by attackers, leading to potential data breaches
  and unauthorized access. This misconfiguration can expose sensitive data to man-in-the-middle
  attacks and compromise the integrity and confidentiality of inter-service communication.
