service: service
resource: service
requirement: No External Ip Configured
title: Disable External IPs for Kubernetes Services
description: This control checks that no external IPs are configured for Kubernetes
  services. A service with an external IP allows traffic from outside the cluster
  to access it directly, which could bypass network policies and other security controls.
  Ensuring that services do not have external IPs unless absolutely necessary reduces
  the attack surface and aligns with security best practices. Properly configured
  services should use internal cluster IPs or be accessible through controlled ingress
  points, such as ingress controllers or load balancers with specific firewall rules.
rationale: Exposing services with external IPs can inadvertently make them accessible
  from outside the cluster, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  attacks such as DDoS. Attackers could exploit misconfigured services to gain entry
  into the cluster, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
