requirement: Threat Detection Integrated
title: Integrate Threat Detection in Kubernetes Service Mesh
description: This rule checks that a Kubernetes service mesh has threat detection
  capabilities integrated, such as anomaly detection and intrusion detection systems
  (IDS). Proper integration involves monitoring service-to-service communications
  for suspicious activities and anomalies, leveraging tools like Istio or Linkerd
  with built-in security features. This setup helps identify and mitigate threats
  early, ensuring compliance with security standards and reducing the risk of security
  incidents.
rationale: Without integrated threat detection, malicious activities within the service
  mesh may go unnoticed, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access.
  Attack vectors such as lateral movement and man-in-the-middle attacks can exploit
  weaknesses in the service mesh traffic if not monitored effectively.
