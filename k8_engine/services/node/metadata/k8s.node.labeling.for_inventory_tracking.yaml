resource: labeling
requirement: For Inventory Tracking
title: Enforce Node Labeling for Enhanced Inventory and Access Control
description: This rule validates that each Kubernetes node is labeled according to
  predefined inventory and access control standards. Proper node labeling helps ensure
  that resources are allocated correctly, policies are enforced accurately, and workloads
  are isolated as intended. For example, labels can dictate node selection constraints
  for pods, ensuring workloads run only on compliant nodes. This reduces the risk
  of configuration drift and unauthorized access, maintaining a secure and compliant
  cluster environment.
rationale: Improper node labeling can lead to mismanagement of resources and potential
  unauthorized access, as labels are often used to apply policies and configurations.
  Without consistent labeling, there is a risk of deploying workloads on inappropriate
  nodes, which could be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive workloads
  through misconfigured permissions or lack of isolation.
