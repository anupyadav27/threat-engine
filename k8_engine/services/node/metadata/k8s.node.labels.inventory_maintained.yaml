service: node
resource: labels
requirement: Inventory Maintained
title: Ensure Node Labels are Consistently Managed and Monitored
description: This rule checks that node labels are consistently applied and managed
  according to best practices. A well-maintained inventory of node labels helps ensure
  that workloads are scheduled on appropriate nodes, enhancing security by preventing
  unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security policies. Proper configuration
  includes verifying that labels are aligned with security policies and monitoring
  changes to prevent unauthorized modifications.
rationale: Improperly managed node labels can lead to unauthorized access and misrouting
  of workloads, which can compromise the security and integrity of the Kubernetes
  cluster. Attackers may exploit misconfigured labels to execute privilege escalation
  attacks by manipulating node selection or resource allocation policies.
