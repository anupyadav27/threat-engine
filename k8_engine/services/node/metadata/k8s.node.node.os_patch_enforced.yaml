resource: node
requirement: Os Patch Enforced
title: Ensure Nodes are Regularly Patched with OS Security Updates
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes nodes are configured to automatically
  apply operating system security patches. It checks for the presence of patch management
  tools and ensures they are properly configured to enforce regular updates. A well-configured
  patch management system minimizes the attack surface by addressing known vulnerabilities
  promptly, thereby protecting nodes from exploitation and maintaining compliance
  with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Unpatched operating systems on Kubernetes nodes can be exploited by attackers
  to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary code. This
  can lead to data breaches and service disruptions. Regular patching reduces exposure
  to known vulnerabilities and strengthens the security posture of the Kubernetes
  cluster.
