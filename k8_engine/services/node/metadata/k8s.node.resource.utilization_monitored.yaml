requirement: Utilization Monitored
title: Monitor Node Resource Utilization Metrics
description: This control checks that node-level resource utilization metrics such
  as CPU, memory, and storage are actively monitored. A well-configured monitoring
  system should alert administrators to spikes or unusual patterns in resource consumption,
  which could indicate a security incident or misconfiguration. Proper monitoring
  helps in early detection of anomalies, ensuring that resources are managed efficiently
  and securely, and aids in maintaining compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to monitor node resource utilization can lead to unanticipated
  resource exhaustion, making nodes unavailable for critical workloads. This can be
  exploited in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack where an attacker consumes resources
  to the point where legitimate workloads cannot be scheduled or executed, leading
  to system downtime.
