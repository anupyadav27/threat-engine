requirement: Configuration Management Enabled
title: Enable Configuration Management on Kubernetes Nodes
description: This control checks if configuration management tools (e.g., Puppet,
  Chef, Ansible) are enabled on Kubernetes nodes to ensure consistent application
  of security settings and patches. Proper configuration management ensures nodes
  adhere to security best practices, reducing the attack surface by preventing drift
  and unauthorized changes. It enhances security by automating updates and maintaining
  compliance with standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without configuration management, Kubernetes nodes may not consistently
  apply security patches or configurations, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities
  being exploited. Attackers could leverage misconfigured nodes to gain unauthorized
  access, escalate privileges, or disrupt services.
