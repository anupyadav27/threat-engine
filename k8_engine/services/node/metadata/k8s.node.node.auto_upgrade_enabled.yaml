requirement: Auto Upgrade Enabled
title: Enable Automatic Node Upgrades for Security Patching
description: This control verifies that automatic updates are enabled on Kubernetes
  nodes, ensuring they receive the latest security patches and bug fixes promptly.
  Proper configuration involves setting the node pool to auto-upgrade mode in managed
  Kubernetes services like GKE or AKS. This proactive measure helps prevent security
  breaches by minimizing the duration that vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thus
  strengthening the overall security posture and compliance with security standards.
rationale: Failure to enable automatic node upgrades can leave nodes vulnerable to
  security exploits due to outdated software. Attackers often target known vulnerabilities
  in Kubernetes nodes to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Ensuring automatic
  updates reduce the window of exposure to such risks.
