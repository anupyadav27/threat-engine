title: Ensure Nodes Run Up-to-Date OS Patches
description: This control checks if the operating systems on Kubernetes nodes are
  running the latest security patches. It involves verifying the patch level of each
  node against a known baseline of security patches. A well-configured patch compliance
  setup ensures that nodes are not susceptible to exploits that target known vulnerabilities.
  By maintaining up-to-date patches, clusters adhere to security best practices, reducing
  attack surfaces and complying with industry standards such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Unpatched operating systems on Kubernetes nodes can expose the cluster
  to vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers. This includes vulnerabilities
  that allow privilege escalation, remote code execution, or denial of service attacks.
  Keeping the OS up-to-date mitigates these risks by applying security patches that
  fix known vulnerabilities.
