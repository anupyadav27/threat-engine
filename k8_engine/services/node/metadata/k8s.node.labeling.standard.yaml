title: Enforce Consistent Node Labeling Standards
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes nodes have labels applied consistently
  according to predefined standards. Properly configured node labels ensure that workloads
  are scheduled correctly and that security policies are enforced based on node characteristics.
  Good configuration involves using a standardized naming convention for labels, avoiding
  sensitive information in labels, and ensuring that labels are used effectively for
  access control and workload isolation. Consistent node labeling helps in maintaining
  a clear infrastructure layout, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance
  with security policies and standards.
rationale: Inconsistent or incorrect node labeling can lead to misrouting of workloads
  and exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized users. Attackers can exploit misconfigured
  labels to escalate privileges, access unauthorized resources, or disrupt applications
  by misdirecting traffic. Standardized node labeling ensures predictable application
  behavior and aids in effective workload isolation, thereby strengthening the cluster's
  security posture.
