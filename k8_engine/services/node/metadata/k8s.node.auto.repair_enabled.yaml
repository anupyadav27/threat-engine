requirement: Repair Enabled
title: Enable Node Auto-Repair for Self-Healing
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes cluster has node auto-repair
  enabled. Node auto-repair automatically identifies and repairs nodes that fail health
  checks, ensuring high availability and reducing the risk of prolonged security vulnerabilities.
  A properly configured auto-repair mechanism helps maintain operational resilience
  and addresses potential security gaps by automatically bringing nodes back to a
  healthy state.
rationale: Without node auto-repair, nodes may remain in a failed state, leading to
  service disruptions and potential exploitation. Attackers can exploit unpatched
  or malfunctioning nodes to escalate privileges or disrupt services, compromising
  the cluster's integrity and availability.
