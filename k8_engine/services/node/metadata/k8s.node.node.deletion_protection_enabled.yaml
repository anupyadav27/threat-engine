rule_id: k8s.node.node.deletion_protection_enabled
service: node
resource: node
requirement: Deletion Protection Enabled
title: Enable Deletion Protection for Kubernetes Nodes
description: This rule checks that deletion protection is enabled on Kubernetes nodes,
  preventing unauthorized or accidental deletion. Proper configuration involves setting
  policies that require additional authorization steps for node deletion, ensuring
  nodes are safeguarded against unintended removal. This protection is critical for
  maintaining the stability and security of the Kubernetes environment, as nodes are
  fundamental components that host pods and manage workloads. Enabling deletion protection
  helps in mitigating risks associated with unintentional downtime and security breaches.
rationale: Without deletion protection, Kubernetes nodes may be accidentally or maliciously
  deleted, leading to potential data loss, service disruptions, and increased attack
  surfaces. Attackers or erroneous scripts could exploit this vulnerability to remove
  nodes, resulting in the loss of critical workloads and compromising the availability
  and integrity of the cluster.
