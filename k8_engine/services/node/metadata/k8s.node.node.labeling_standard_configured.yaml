requirement: Labeling Standard Configured
title: Enforce Node Labeling Standards for Security Compliance
description: This control checks that all Kubernetes nodes adhere to a predefined
  labeling standard. A standardized labeling scheme is essential for implementing
  effective node-level security policies and resource management. This validation
  involves ensuring that each node has the required labels and that these labels are
  used consistently across the cluster. Proper node labeling facilitates accurate
  scheduling decisions, access control, and monitoring, ultimately enhancing the security
  and compliance posture of the Kubernetes infrastructure.
rationale: Misconfigured or inconsistent node labels can lead to security risks such
  as unauthorized access or resource misallocation. Attackers may exploit incorrectly
  labeled nodes to bypass security policies or gain unintended access to sensitive
  workloads. Proper labeling helps ensure that nodes are correctly identified and
  managed according to security policies, reducing the risk of privilege escalation
  and lateral movement within the cluster.
