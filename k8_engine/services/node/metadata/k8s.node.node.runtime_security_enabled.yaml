rule_id: k8s.node.node.runtime_security_enabled
service: node
resource: node
requirement: Runtime Security Enabled
title: Ensure Node Runtime Security Features are Enabled
description: This rule checks that runtime security features, such as AppArmor, SELinux,
  or seccomp, are enabled and properly configured on Kubernetes nodes. Proper configuration
  of these security mechanisms helps isolate containers from the host, restricts their
  capabilities, and reduces the potential attack surface. By enforcing these settings,
  the cluster is better protected against unauthorized access and exploits, thereby
  enhancing the overall security posture.
rationale: Without runtime security features enabled on Kubernetes nodes, the cluster
  is vulnerable to unauthorized access and malicious activities, such as privilege
  escalation or container escape. Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the container
  runtime to gain access to host resources, leading to potential data breaches or
  service disruptions.
