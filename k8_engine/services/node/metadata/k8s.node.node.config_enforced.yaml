title: Ensure Node Configuration Compliance with Security Best Practices
description: This control checks that each Kubernetes node adheres to security best
  practices for configuration management. It ensures that the node's kubelet is securely
  configured, including settings related to authentication, authorization, and TLS
  encryption. Proper configuration mitigates risks such as unauthorized access and
  privilege escalation by enforcing strict access controls and secure communication
  channels. Adhering to these standards supports compliance with the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark and other industry best practices.
rationale: Improper node configuration can lead to vulnerabilities that expose the
  cluster to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and data breaches. Attackers
  can exploit misconfigurations to gain control over nodes, leading to potential denial
  of service, data tampering, or lateral movement within the cluster.
