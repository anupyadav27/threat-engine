requirement: Tpm Verification Enabled
title: Enable TPM Verification on Kubernetes Nodes
description: This control checks that TPM verification is enabled on each Kubernetes
  node. Proper configuration involves ensuring the TPM module is active and correctly
  integrated with the node's boot process. TPM provides a hardware root of trust,
  which helps protect against rootkit and bootkit attacks. Enabling TPM verification
  ensures that nodes only run trusted code, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and enhancing the overall security posture of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Without TPM verification enabled, a Kubernetes node is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and data tampering. TPM (Trusted Platform Module) provides hardware-based
  security functions, ensuring the integrity of the node's boot process and safeguarding
  cryptographic keys. A compromised node could allow attackers to deploy malicious
  workloads, exfiltrate sensitive data, or disrupt cluster operations.
