requirement: Protection Enabled
title: Enable Node Deletion Protection to Prevent Accidental Loss
description: This control checks that node deletion protection is enabled, preventing
  nodes from being accidentally or maliciously removed from the cluster. A properly
  configured deletion protection setting ensures that nodes cannot be deleted without
  explicit administrator approval. This minimizes the risk of accidental downtime
  and unauthorized node removal, thereby enhancing the resilience and security of
  the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Without node deletion protection, a Kubernetes node can be inadvertently
  or maliciously deleted, leading to service disruptions, loss of data, and reduced
  cluster capacity. Attack vectors include unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API
  or insufficiently protected credentials, allowing attackers to issue node deletion
  commands.
