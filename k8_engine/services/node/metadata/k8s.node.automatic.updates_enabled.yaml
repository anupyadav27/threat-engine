title: Enable Automatic Updates for Kubernetes Nodes
description: This control checks whether Kubernetes nodes are configured to receive
  automatic updates. Good configuration involves enabling automatic updates to ensure
  nodes are up-to-date with the latest security patches and features. This helps protect
  the cluster from known vulnerabilities and exploits, thereby maintaining system
  integrity and compliance with security standards.
rationale: Failure to enable automatic updates on Kubernetes nodes can leave nodes
  vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities and exploits. Attackers may exploit
  outdated components to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Ensuring nodes
  are automatically updated reduces the attack surface by patching known vulnerabilities
  promptly.
