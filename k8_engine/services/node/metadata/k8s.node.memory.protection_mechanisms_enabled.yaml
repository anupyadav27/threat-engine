title: Enable Node Memory Protection Mechanisms
description: This control checks that Kubernetes nodes are configured with memory
  protection mechanisms like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space
  Layout Randomization) to mitigate risks of memory-based attacks. Properly configured
  memory protection ensures that executable code cannot run in non-executable memory
  regions, reducing the attack surface and preventing common exploits. This configuration
  aligns with security best practices and compliance standards, such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without memory protection mechanisms, Kubernetes nodes are vulnerable to
  various security threats, such as buffer overflow attacks, which can lead to unauthorized
  access and control over node processes. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to
  elevate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt services, compromising the
  cluster's integrity and availability.
