resource: configuration
requirement: Compliance Check
title: Enforce Node Configuration Compliance with CIS Benchmarks
description: This rule checks that each Kubernetes node's configuration aligns with
  the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark standards. It validates settings such as API server
  authentication, authorization protocols, and secure default configurations. Proper
  compliance ensures that nodes are not weak links within the cluster, thereby reducing
  vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Adhering to these benchmarks
  helps maintain a strong security posture and meet regulatory compliance requirements.
rationale: Misconfigured node settings can expose Kubernetes clusters to various security
  threats, including unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Ensuring node configurations
  comply with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark reduces the attack surface and mitigates
  the risk of exploitation through well-known vulnerabilities.
