requirement: Node Hardening Applied Enforced
title: Enforce Node Hardening for Secure Configuration Compliance
description: This rule checks that node hardening practices are enforced on Kubernetes
  nodes. Specifically, it ensures that security configurations such as kernel parameters,
  network settings, and file permissions are aligned with hardening guidelines like
  the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. Proper node hardening minimizes the attack surface
  by ensuring that only necessary services are running, sensitive data is protected,
  and access controls are tightly managed. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential exploits targeting the node's operating system.
rationale: Misconfigured or weakly configured nodes can expose Kubernetes clusters
  to various security threats, such as unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
  Nodes without enforced hardening are susceptible to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities
  in the underlying operating system or container runtime, potentially leading to
  cluster compromise.
