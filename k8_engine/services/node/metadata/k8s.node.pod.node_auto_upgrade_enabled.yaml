title: Enable Automatic Node Upgrades for Security Patching
description: This control ensures that the Kubernetes nodes have automatic upgrades
  enabled, which is critical for applying security patches and updates in a timely
  manner. Proper configuration involves setting up the cluster to automatically update
  node components, such as the kubelet and container runtime, ensuring that security
  vulnerabilities are quickly addressed. This reduces the attack surface by preventing
  attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer
  versions.
rationale: Failing to enable automatic node upgrades can leave nodes running outdated
  software with known vulnerabilities. This exposes the cluster to potential exploits,
  such as privilege escalation attacks, or container escape vulnerabilities, by attackers
  leveraging unpatched security flaws.
