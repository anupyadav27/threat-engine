title: Ensure Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Integration on Nodes
description: This rule checks that Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions
  are properly configured and enabled on Kubernetes nodes. EDR integration involves
  deploying agents that monitor system activities and alert administrators to suspicious
  behavior. A correctly configured EDR setup ensures comprehensive monitoring, logs
  collection, and threat detection, enhancing the security posture by providing detailed
  visibility into node activities and enabling rapid incident response.
rationale: Without EDR integration, Kubernetes nodes are vulnerable to undetected
  threats, including malware and unauthorized access. EDR provides real-time monitoring
  and response capabilities that are essential for identifying and mitigating security
  incidents. Misconfiguration can lead to delayed detection of breaches, increasing
  the risk of data exfiltration and service disruption.
