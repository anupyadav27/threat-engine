requirement: Automatic Updates Enabled
title: Enable Automatic Operating System Updates on Nodes
description: This check verifies that the operating system on each Kubernetes node
  is configured to automatically apply updates. A properly configured system should
  regularly check for and install security patches without manual intervention. This
  practice is crucial for mitigating risks associated with unpatched vulnerabilities,
  maintaining system integrity, and ensuring compliance with security benchmarks such
  as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failing to enable automatic updates on Kubernetes nodes can leave the system
  vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities and exploits. Attackers may exploit
  these unpatched vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code,
  or cause denial-of-service conditions. Ensuring timely updates closes these security
  gaps and enhances the overall resilience of the Kubernetes cluster.
