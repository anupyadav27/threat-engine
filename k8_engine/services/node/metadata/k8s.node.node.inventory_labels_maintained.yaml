service: node
resource: node
requirement: Inventory Labels Maintained
title: Ensure Node Inventory Labels are Consistently Maintained
description: This rule checks that inventory labels on Kubernetes nodes are consistently
  maintained and adhere to predefined standards. Properly maintained labels facilitate
  efficient resource allocation, monitoring, and access control policies. A well-labeled
  node inventory ensures that security policies are applied correctly and that nodes
  are easily identifiable for auditing and incident response purposes. Ensuring consistency
  in node labeling reduces the risk of privilege escalation and helps in maintaining
  compliance with security benchmarks like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date inventory labels on nodes is crucial
  for effective resource management and security monitoring. Without proper labels,
  nodes may be misclassified, leading to potential misconfigurations and unauthorized
  access. Attackers could exploit unlabelled or incorrectly labelled nodes to move
  laterally within the cluster or hide anomalous activities.
