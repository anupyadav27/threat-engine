requirement: Resource Utilization Audited
title: Audit Node Resource Utilization for Security Compliance
description: This rule verifies that resource utilization metrics for Kubernetes nodes
  are being properly audited. It checks for the presence of monitoring solutions that
  track CPU, memory, and disk usage, ensuring they are configured to log data at appropriate
  intervals. Proper auditing of these metrics enables the detection of anomalies that
  could signify security incidents or misconfigurations, helping to maintain a robust
  security posture and optimize resource management. A well-configured audit process
  aids in compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to audit resource utilization on Kubernetes nodes can lead to undetected
  performance bottlenecks, potential denial of service attacks, and inefficient resource
  allocation, which may be exploited by attackers to degrade service availability
  or escalate privileges. Regular auditing helps in identifying abnormal patterns
  and securing the cluster against such vulnerabilities.
