title: Enable and Enforce Node Configuration Management
description: This control checks if node configuration management tools, such as kubelet
  configurations, are enabled and enforced. Proper configuration management ensures
  that nodes adhere to security standards, preventing unauthorized access and changes.
  A well-managed node configuration helps maintain system integrity, enforces compliance
  with security policies, and reduces the risk of misconfigurations that can be exploited
  by attackers.
rationale: Without proper management of node configurations, Kubernetes clusters are
  vulnerable to unauthorized changes, potentially leading to security breaches. Attack
  vectors include unauthorized nodes joining the cluster and adversaries altering
  node settings to disrupt services or gain further access.
