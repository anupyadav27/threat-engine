title: Enable and Configure Node Resource Monitoring
description: This control checks that Kubernetes node resources have monitoring enabled
  according to best security practices. It ensures that resource usage metrics such
  as CPU, memory, and disk are collected and analyzed for unusual patterns. A well-configured
  monitoring system can alert administrators to potential security incidents or resource
  misconfigurations, thereby reducing the attack surface and complying with industry
  standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper monitoring of Kubernetes node resources, anomalous activities
  or resource exhaustion may go undetected, leading to potential breaches or denial
  of service. Attackers could exploit unmonitored nodes to perform lateral movement
  or escalate privileges within the cluster. Monitoring helps in early detection of
  such threats.
