resource: node
requirement: Memory Protection Mechanisms Enabled
title: Enable Kernel Memory Protection on Kubernetes Nodes
description: This rule checks whether kernel-level memory protection features, such
  as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP),
  are enabled on Kubernetes nodes. Enabling these features helps prevent memory-based
  attacks by randomizing memory address space and ensuring code execution restrictions.
  Proper configuration involves ensuring that these mechanisms are active and correctly
  enforced across all nodes, thereby reducing the attack surface and enhancing the
  overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: If memory protection mechanisms on Kubernetes nodes are not enabled, nodes
  become susceptible to attacks such as buffer overflows, memory corruption, and unauthorized
  access to sensitive data. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to
  execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or compromise node integrity, ultimately
  leading to cluster-wide security breaches.
