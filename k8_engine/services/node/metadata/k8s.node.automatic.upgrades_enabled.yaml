requirement: Upgrades Enabled
title: Ensure Node Automatic Upgrades are Enabled
description: This control checks that automatic upgrades are enabled for Kubernetes
  nodes, ensuring they automatically receive the latest security patches and updates.
  A well-configured upgrade process minimizes the risk of running vulnerable software
  versions, aligning with security best practices and compliance standards. Proper
  configuration involves enabling features like live kernel patching and using managed
  node groups that support automatic updates, which helps maintain node security posture
  and operational stability.
rationale: Without automatic upgrades enabled on Kubernetes nodes, they may remain
  vulnerable to known security exploits due to outdated software. Attackers can leverage
  these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Enabling
  automatic upgrades ensures nodes are patched with the latest security fixes, reducing
  the attack surface and improving the cluster's resilience against exploitation.
