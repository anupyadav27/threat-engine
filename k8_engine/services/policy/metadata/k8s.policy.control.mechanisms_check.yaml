title: Ensure Network Policies are Enforced
description: This control checks that network policies are defined and enforced within
  the Kubernetes cluster. Network policies are essential for segmenting network traffic
  and controlling ingress and egress at the pod level. A well-configured network policy
  ensures that only authorized traffic is permitted, thereby preventing unauthorized
  access and potential attacks. It validates that policies are in place and properly
  restrict traffic in line with security best practices and compliance requirements.
rationale: Without proper network policies, applications running in a Kubernetes cluster
  may be exposed to unauthorized access and lateral movement by malicious actors.
  This can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance with security
  standards. Network policies allow for fine-grained control over traffic flow between
  pods, reducing the attack surface by only allowing necessary communications.
