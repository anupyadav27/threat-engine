requirement: Risk Assessment Integrated Enabled
title: Enable PodSecurityPolicy for Risk Assessment
description: This control checks whether PodSecurityPolicy incorporates risk assessment
  mechanisms to evaluate and enforce security constraints on pods. A properly configured
  PodSecurityPolicy ensures that pods do not run with excessive privileges or access
  unnecessary resources, thus minimizing potential attack vectors. It validates that
  policies are set to restrict capabilities such as running as root, accessing host
  namespaces, or using host networking. This reduces the attack surface and aligns
  with security best practices and standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without the integration of risk assessment in PodSecurityPolicy, clusters
  are vulnerable to misconfigurations that could lead to privilege escalation, data
  breaches, and unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit lax security policies
  to escalate privileges or compromise sensitive data.
