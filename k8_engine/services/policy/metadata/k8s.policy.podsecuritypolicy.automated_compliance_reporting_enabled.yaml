service: policy
resource: podsecuritypolicy
requirement: Automated Compliance Reporting Enabled
title: Enable Automated Compliance Reporting for PodSecurityPolicy
description: This control checks if PodSecurityPolicy is configured with automated
  compliance reporting to ensure continuous monitoring of policy adherence. By validating
  this configuration, it helps identify and rectify security policy violations in
  real-time, thus reducing the attack surface. A well-configured compliance reporting
  system aids in maintaining alignment with security benchmarks like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark and mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access and privilege
  escalation.
rationale: Without automated compliance reporting, deviations from security policies
  can go unnoticed, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited. Attackers
  may exploit misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges
  within the Kubernetes cluster.
