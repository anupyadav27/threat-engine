requirement: Cis Benchmark Compliance Enabled
title: Ensure PodSecurityPolicies Adhere to CIS Benchmarks
description: This control checks that PodSecurityPolicies are configured to meet CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark standards. It ensures that policies enforce strict security
  measures such as disabling privileged containers, restricting host network and host
  PID access, and setting appropriate user and group IDs. Proper configuration mitigates
  security risks by constraining what pods can do and what resources they can access,
  thus adhering to industry best practices and compliance requirements.
rationale: If PodSecurityPolicies (PSPs) are not configured according to CIS Benchmarks,
  it may lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation, host filesystem access,
  or running of untrusted workloads. Attackers could exploit these misconfigurations
  to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within the cluster.
