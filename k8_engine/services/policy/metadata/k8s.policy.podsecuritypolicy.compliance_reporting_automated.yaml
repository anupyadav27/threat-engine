requirement: Compliance Reporting Automated
title: Automate Compliance Reporting for PodSecurityPolicies
description: This control checks for the presence of automated compliance reporting
  mechanisms for PodSecurityPolicies within the Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that
  any deviations from the defined security policies are logged and reported promptly.
  A well-configured automated reporting system alerts administrators to potential
  security violations, enabling rapid response and remediation. Compliance with this
  control helps maintain adherence to industry standards such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark, reducing the risk of security breaches.
rationale: Without automated compliance reporting for PodSecurityPolicies, organizations
  face increased risks of undetected policy violations, which may lead to unauthorized
  access or privilege escalation attacks. Attackers can exploit improperly configured
  pods to gain access to sensitive resources or elevate their privileges within the
  cluster, undermining the security posture.
