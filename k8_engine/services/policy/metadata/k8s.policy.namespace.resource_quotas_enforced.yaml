requirement: Resource Quotas Enforced
title: Enforce Resource Quotas on Namespaces
description: This rule checks whether resource quotas are applied to all namespaces
  within the Kubernetes cluster. A properly configured resource quota ensures that
  each namespace is limited in terms of CPU, memory, and other resources, preventing
  any single tenant from monopolizing cluster resources. This not only helps in maintaining
  fair resource allocation but also protects against accidental or malicious resource
  overconsumption, thereby maintaining cluster stability and availability.
rationale: Without enforced resource quotas, a single namespace can consume excessive
  resources, potentially leading to resource starvation for other workloads. This
  lack of control can be exploited by attackers to perform Denial of Service (DoS)
  attacks by saturating system resources, disrupting the availability of services,
  and impacting overall cluster stability.
