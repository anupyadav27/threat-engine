rule_id: k8s.policy.podsecuritypolicy.identity_verification_enabled
service: policy
resource: podsecuritypolicy
requirement: Identity Verification Enabled
title: Enable PodSecurityPolicy for Identity Verification
description: This rule checks that PodSecurityPolicies are configured to enforce identity
  verification, ensuring that only authenticated identities can create, modify, or
  delete pods. Proper configuration involves setting up policies that verify the identity
  of service accounts and users interacting with the cluster. This helps prevent unauthorized
  access and ensures compliance with security best practices by controlling which
  entities can execute specific actions within the cluster.
rationale: Without identity verification, unauthorized entities can exploit access
  controls, potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks or unauthorized access
  to sensitive workloads. Proper identity verification mitigates risks associated
  with impersonation and unauthorized access, ensuring that only authenticated and
  authorized identities can interact with the Kubernetes API server.
