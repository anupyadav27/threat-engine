requirement: Gitops Integration Enabled
title: Ensure GitOps Integration for PodSecurityPolicy
description: This control checks if GitOps integration is enabled for PodSecurityPolicies
  (PSPs) to ensure that any changes to security policies are version-controlled and
  auditable. A proper GitOps setup involves storing PSPs in a Git repository, where
  they are automatically applied and monitored for unauthorized changes. It ensures
  that security policies are consistently enforced across environments, thus enhancing
  security by preventing configuration drift and unauthorized modifications.
rationale: Without GitOps integration, configuration drift can occur, leading to potential
  security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or privilege escalation. Attackers
  could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control over Kubernetes resources. GitOps
  provides a declarative approach to managing Kubernetes configurations, ensuring
  changes are tracked and auditable, reducing the risk of security misconfigurations.
