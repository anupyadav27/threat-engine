requirement: Plan Documented
title: Ensure Documented Disaster Recovery Plan for Kubernetes
description: This rule checks that a detailed disaster recovery plan for Kubernetes
  is documented and maintained. An effective plan should outline specific procedures
  for backup, recovery, and failover, ensuring that Kubernetes workloads can be restored
  quickly and securely after a disruption. Proper documentation helps coordinate response
  efforts, minimizes downtime, and ensures consistency in recovery operations. Additionally,
  it helps in auditing processes to meet compliance with industry standards like CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without a documented disaster recovery plan, Kubernetes environments are
  vulnerable to prolonged downtime and data loss in the event of a failure. Attackers
  could exploit this lack of preparedness by orchestrating disruptions that take advantage
  of slow recovery processes, leading to potential breaches of availability and loss
  of critical data. This is particularly crucial for meeting compliance requirements
  and ensuring business continuity.
