title: Ensure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Configures Pods for Optimal Workload Management
description: This control checks if the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is properly configured
  to manage workloads efficiently and securely. Specifically, it ensures that the
  HPA is set to scale pods based on accurate and relevant metrics such as CPU and
  memory usage. Proper configuration allows the cluster to respond dynamically to
  workload demands, thereby optimizing resource usage, maintaining performance under
  load, and reducing the risk of resource exhaustion and denial-of-service conditions.
rationale: Improper configuration of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can lead
  to inefficient resource utilization and potential service disruptions. This misconfiguration
  can expose pods to denial-of-service attacks by not scaling adequately under heavy
  load or by over-provisioning resources, which can lead to unnecessary costs and
  reduced availability of other services.
