requirement: System Configured
title: Configure Event Alerting for Security Compliance
description: This control checks whether Kubernetes event alerting is configured according
  to security best practices. It verifies that alerts are generated for key security
  events, such as unauthorized access attempts or configuration changes. A well-configured
  alerting system helps in quickly identifying and responding to potential security
  incidents, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring compliance with security standards
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper configuration of Kubernetes event alerting, critical security
  incidents may go undetected, allowing potential attackers to exploit vulnerabilities
  unnoticed. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions.
  Ensuring event alerting is properly set up helps in timely detection and response
  to anomalies or malicious activities.
