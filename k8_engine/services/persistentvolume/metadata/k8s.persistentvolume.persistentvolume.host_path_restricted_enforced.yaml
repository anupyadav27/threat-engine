title: Restrict HostPath Usage in PersistentVolumes
description: This control checks that PersistentVolumes do not use HostPath without
  explicit, justified need. A secure configuration involves using higher-level storage
  abstractions like PersistentVolumeClaims with dynamic provisioning, or ensuring
  HostPath volumes are scoped to specific, non-sensitive directories with appropriate
  permissions. This reduces the attack surface by preventing containers from accessing
  the host's file system in an unrestricted manner.
rationale: Using HostPath in PersistentVolumes can expose the host file system to
  containers, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential
  privilege escalation. Attackers could exploit poorly configured HostPaths to access
  sensitive files or gain higher privileges on the host system.
