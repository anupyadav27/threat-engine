title: Enforce RBAC for PersistentVolumes
description: This control checks that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is properly
  enforced on PersistentVolumes. A secure configuration ensures that only authorized
  users and service accounts have the ability to create, modify, or delete PersistentVolumes.
  This helps prevent unauthorized access and modifications, reducing the risk of data
  exposure and unauthorized data manipulation. Proper RBAC configuration involves
  defining roles with specific permissions and binding those roles to users or groups
  that truly require access, in line with the principle of least privilege.
rationale: If RBAC is not enforced on PersistentVolumes, unauthorized users could
  gain access to sensitive data stored in the cluster, leading to data breaches and
  potential data loss. Without proper RBAC, attackers could escalate privileges or
  perform unauthorized operations on PersistentVolumes, exploiting vulnerabilities
  through misconfigured access controls.
