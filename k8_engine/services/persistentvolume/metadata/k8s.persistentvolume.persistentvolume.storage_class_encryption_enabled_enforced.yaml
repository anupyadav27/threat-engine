requirement: Storage Class Encryption Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Encryption for PersistentVolume Storage Classes
description: This control checks if the encryption feature is enabled for all PersistentVolume
  storage classes within the Kubernetes environment. A properly configured PersistentVolume
  storage class with encryption ensures that all data written to the storage is encrypted
  at rest, adhering to security best practices and compliance requirements. A correct
  configuration involves setting up storage classes that support encryption and ensuring
  that these are used for all PersistentVolumes. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive data, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the
  Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Without encryption enabled on PersistentVolume storage classes, sensitive
  data stored on disk can be susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  potential data corruption. This misconfiguration exposes the data at rest to potential
  attackers who might compromise the underlying storage infrastructure or gain unauthorized
  access to the physical hardware. Encrypting data at rest ensures that even if unauthorized
  access occurs, the data remains protected through cryptographic measures.
