requirement: Policy Defined
title: Enforce Backup Policies for Persistent Volumes
description: This rule verifies that all persistent volumes in the Kubernetes cluster
  have an associated backup policy. A well-defined backup policy specifies the frequency
  of backups, retention duration, and access controls to ensure that data can be restored
  quickly and securely in case of data loss incidents. Proper backup policies help
  in maintaining data integrity, minimizing downtime, and ensuring compliance with
  industry standards and regulations. This rule enhances security by preventing data
  loss and ensuring business continuity.
rationale: Without a defined backup policy for persistent volumes, critical data may
  be at risk of loss due to accidental deletion or malicious attacks such as ransomware.
  Misconfigured or absent policies can lead to non-compliance with data protection
  regulations, potentially resulting in data breaches and financial penalties.
