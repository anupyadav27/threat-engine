resource: persistentvolume
requirement: Csi Encryption Verified Enforced
title: Enforce CSI Volume Encryption for PersistentVolumes
description: This rule checks that PersistentVolumes using CSI drivers have encryption
  enabled and enforced. A properly configured CSI encryption setup ensures that data
  at rest is protected by cryptographic methods, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized
  data access. This involves verifying the encryption settings in the StorageClass
  and ensuring that encryption keys are managed securely. Adhering to these practices
  helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity, aligning with industry security
  standards.
rationale: If CSI encryption is not enforced on PersistentVolumes, sensitive data
  stored on these volumes could be accessed by unauthorized users or malicious actors
  in the event of a data breach. This increases the risk of data leakage, non-compliance
  with data protection regulations, and potential exploitation by ransomware attacks.
