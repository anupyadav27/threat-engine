requirement: Pv Access Modes Restricted Enabled
title: Restrict PersistentVolume Access Modes
description: This check ensures that PersistentVolumes are configured with the most
  restrictive access modes necessary for their intended use. A well-configured PV
  should limit access to only those modes required by the application, such as 'ReadOnlyMany'
  instead of 'ReadWriteMany', to minimize the potential attack surface. By validating
  and enforcing restricted access modes, this control helps prevent unauthorized data
  access and modification, thus enhancing the security posture of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: If PersistentVolume (PV) access modes are overly permissive, it can lead
  to unauthorized access or malicious data manipulation. This misconfiguration could
  allow containers to mount volumes with write permissions when only read access is
  necessary, increasing the risk of data breach and corruption. Attackers could exploit
  this to exfiltrate sensitive data or inject malicious content.
