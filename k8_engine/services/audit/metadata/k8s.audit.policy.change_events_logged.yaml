requirement: Change Events Logged
title: Ensure Audit Logging of Kubernetes API Changes
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured
  to log events related to changes in the API, such as modifications to resources,
  role bindings, and configurations. A comprehensive audit policy should include rules
  that specifically capture create, update, delete, and patch operations on critical
  resources. Proper logging helps detect unauthorized actions, supports incident response
  efforts, and ensures compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
  It also aids in identifying misconfigurations and potential security breaches by
  providing a clear history of changes.
rationale: Failure to log API change events can lead to undetected unauthorized modifications,
  allowing attackers to alter configurations or escalate privileges without notice.
  Logging these events is crucial for forensic analysis and accountability. Without
  proper logging, it becomes challenging to track changes, identify potential breaches,
  and comply with regulatory standards that require audit trails.
