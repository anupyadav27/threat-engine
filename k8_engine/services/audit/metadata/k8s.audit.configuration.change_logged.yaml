requirement: Change Logged
title: Ensure Audit Logs Capture Configuration Changes
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes audit logs are configured to capture
  all changes to system configurations. A properly configured audit log should track
  who performed the change, what was changed, and when. Such logging is critical for
  forensic analysis, accountability, and compliance with regulatory standards. Ensuring
  that configuration changes are logged helps in detecting and responding to unauthorized
  access attempts and maintaining a robust security framework.
rationale: Failure to log configuration changes can allow unauthorized modifications
  to go undetected, potentially leading to security breaches. Attackers may exploit
  this by altering configurations to weaken security postures, establish persistence,
  or disrupt services without leaving a trace. Timely detection of such changes is
  crucial to prevent or mitigate attacks like privilege escalation and data exfiltration.
