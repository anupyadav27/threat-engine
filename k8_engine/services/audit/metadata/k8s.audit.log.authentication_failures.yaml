title: Monitor and Alert on Authentication Failures in Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control ensures that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to capture
  and alert on authentication failures. Proper configuration includes setting up audit
  policies that log failed authentication attempts and integrating these logs with
  a monitoring and alerting system. This setup helps security teams quickly identify
  and respond to unauthorized access attempts, reducing the risk of a successful breach.
  A well-configured audit log should include details like the source IP, user identity,
  and timestamp of the failed attempts, providing context for further investigation.
rationale: Failure to properly monitor authentication failures can result in undetected
  unauthorized access attempts. Such attempts can be indicative of an ongoing attack
  or misconfiguration that could lead to a breach of sensitive data or disruption
  of services. Attackers often exploit weak authentication mechanisms to gain access,
  and being alerted to repeated failed attempts is critical to identifying and mitigating
  these threats promptly.
