requirement: Changes Logged
title: Log NetworkPolicy Configuration Changes
description: This control checks that all changes to Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources
  are being logged. Proper logging involves capturing create, update, and delete operations
  on NetworkPolicies. This enables monitoring of policy changes that could otherwise
  expose the cluster to unauthorized network traffic. Ensuring that these logs are
  collected and monitored helps detect and respond to policy misconfigurations and
  unauthorized access attempts, thereby enhancing the security posture and ensuring
  compliance with security standards.
rationale: Failure to log changes to NetworkPolicy configurations can lead to undetected
  security breaches, as malicious actors may alter policies to allow unauthorized
  traffic. Without proper logging, it becomes difficult to trace unauthorized access
  or changes, potentially leading to data breaches or compliance violations.
