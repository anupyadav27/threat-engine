requirement: Event Timestamp Captured
title: Ensure Accurate Event Timestamps in Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  capture accurate event timestamps. A properly configured audit policy includes a
  'stage' field with precise timestamps for each event, ensuring that all actions
  within the cluster are logged with a reliable time reference. This configuration
  aids in compliance with security standards and regulatory requirements by providing
  a clear and traceable record of cluster activities, thereby enhancing the detection
  of anomalies and unauthorized access.
rationale: Accurate timestamps in audit logs are crucial for incident investigation
  and forensic analysis. If timestamps are misconfigured or missing, it can lead to
  difficulties in correlating events, identifying unauthorized activities, and establishing
  timelines of security incidents. Attackers might exploit this by obfuscating their
  tracks or creating confusion during incident response.
