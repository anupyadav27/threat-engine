requirement: Integrity Enabled
title: Enable Integrity Verification for Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control checks that integrity verification is enabled for Kubernetes
  audit logs. Proper configuration involves using mechanisms like checksums or digital
  signatures to ensure that any unauthorized changes to the logs are detectable. Ensuring
  audit log integrity helps maintain a reliable trail of events for security monitoring
  and compliance audits, thereby reducing the risk of undetected security breaches.
rationale: Without integrity verification, Kubernetes audit logs are vulnerable to
  tampering, which can mask unauthorized activities, hinder forensic investigations,
  and lead to non-compliance with regulatory standards. Attackers may alter logs to
  hide traces of their actions, making it crucial to ensure logs are protected against
  unauthorized modifications.
