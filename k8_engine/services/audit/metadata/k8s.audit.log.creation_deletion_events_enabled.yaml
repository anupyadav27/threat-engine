resource: log
requirement: Creation Deletion Events Enabled
title: Enable Audit Logging for Resource Creation and Deletion
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes audit logging configuration captures
  events related to resource creation and deletion. Proper audit logging ensures that
  all actions affecting the state of the cluster are recorded, which is critical for
  detecting unauthorized activities and maintaining a secure environment. A good configuration
  involves setting up audit policies to log 'create', 'delete', and 'deletecollection'
  verbs for important resources. This helps in monitoring unauthorized access, ensuring
  compliance with security standards, and facilitating incident response.
rationale: Without logging creation and deletion events, it becomes challenging to
  track unauthorized changes or resource manipulations that could lead to security
  breaches. Attackers could create or delete resources to disrupt services or cover
  their tracks, and the absence of logs would hinder forensic investigations and breach
  detection.
