requirement: Captures Security Events
title: Comprehensive Security Event Auditing in Kubernetes
description: This check ensures that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  capture all relevant security events, such as changes to RBAC settings, pod and
  container lifecycle events, and authentication and authorization requests. A robust
  audit policy should be in place to log these events, which can then be analyzed
  to detect anomalies, investigate incidents, and fulfill compliance requirements.
  Proper configuration includes defining audit policy rules with appropriate levels
  such as 'Metadata', 'Request', 'RequestResponse', and ensuring logs are securely
  stored and monitored.
rationale: Without a properly configured audit policy, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable
  to undetected security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and data exfiltration.
  Attackers could exploit this to move laterally within the cluster, alter configurations,
  or gain access to sensitive data without leaving a trace. Comprehensive auditing
  helps in detecting such malicious activities and maintaining accountability.
