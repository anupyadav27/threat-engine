resource: policy
requirement: Event Types Captured
title: Capture All Relevant Event Types in Audit Policy
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  capture all necessary event types, such as 'RequestReceived', 'ResponseStarted',
  'ResponseComplete', and 'Panic'. A well-configured audit policy ensures comprehensive
  logging, allowing for effective monitoring and forensic analysis of actions taken
  within the cluster. Capturing all relevant events helps in fulfilling compliance
  requirements, identifying suspicious activities, and ensuring accountability.
rationale: Failure to capture all relevant event types in the Kubernetes audit logs
  can lead to missing critical security events, making it difficult to detect unauthorized
  access attempts, policy violations, or other malicious activities. An attacker could
  exploit this misconfiguration to perform actions without being detected, increasing
  the risk of a successful attack on the cluster.
