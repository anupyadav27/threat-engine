rule_id: k8s.audit.policy.event_location_captured
service: audit
resource: policy
requirement: Event Location Captured
title: Ensure Audit Logs Capture Event Source Location
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured
  to capture the source location of events. A well-configured audit log should include
  details such as the user, the action performed, the resource affected, and the location
  from where the action was initiated. Properly capturing this information enhances
  the traceability of actions within the cluster, facilitates compliance with security
  regulations, and strengthens the overall security posture by providing necessary
  data for detecting and investigating security incidents.
rationale: If the event source location is not captured in audit logs, it becomes
  difficult to trace the origin of security incidents, potentially allowing unauthorized
  activities to go undetected. Attackers could exploit this gap to obscure their activities,
  making it challenging to identify and mitigate threats effectively. Capturing the
  location of events helps in identifying patterns of malicious behavior and supports
  forensic investigations.
