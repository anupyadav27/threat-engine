service: audit
resource: policy
requirement: Captures Timestamps
title: Ensure Audit Logs Capture Precise Timestamps
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  capture precise timestamps for every recorded event. A correctly configured audit
  policy includes timestamps in ISO 8601 format, ensuring that each event log is time-stamped
  accurately. This precision is crucial for tracing unauthorized access attempts,
  monitoring system changes, and ensuring accountability. Proper timestamping aids
  in compliance with industry standards and provides a solid foundation for maintaining
  a secure and auditable Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Capturing precise timestamps in audit logs is essential for effective incident
  response and forensic analysis. Without accurate timestamps, correlating events
  across systems becomes challenging, which can hinder the identification of security
  incidents, delay response actions, and obscure the timeline of unauthorized activities.
