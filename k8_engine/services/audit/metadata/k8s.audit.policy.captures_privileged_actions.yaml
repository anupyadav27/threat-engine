resource: policy
requirement: Captures Privileged Actions
title: Audit Privileged Kubernetes API Actions
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured
  to specifically capture actions performed with elevated privileges. It ensures that
  all access and modifications by users with admin-level privileges are logged. A
  well-configured audit policy will include capturing 'create', 'update', 'delete',
  and 'exec' actions on critical resources such as secrets, pods, and nodes. This
  monitoring helps in detecting and responding to unauthorized or anomalous activities,
  enhancing the overall security posture.
rationale: Failure to accurately capture privileged actions in Kubernetes can lead
  to undetected unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Attackers may exploit
  misconfigured audit policies to perform malicious activities without leaving a trace,
  potentially compromising sensitive data and system integrity.
