requirement: High Severity Event Detection
title: Detect and Alert on High Severity Events in Audit Logs
description: This control ensures that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to detect
  and alert on high severity events. It validates the presence of rules that capture
  critical actions like access to sensitive resources or unauthorized modifications.
  Proper configuration includes setting appropriate audit policies and integrating
  with alerting systems to promptly respond to potential threats. This helps in early
  detection of compromise and aids in forensic analysis during security incidents.
rationale: Misconfigured audit logging can lead to undetected malicious activities,
  such as privilege escalation or unauthorized access, compromising the entire Kubernetes
  cluster. High severity events often indicate critical issues that could be exploited
  by attackers to gain control or exfiltrate sensitive data.
