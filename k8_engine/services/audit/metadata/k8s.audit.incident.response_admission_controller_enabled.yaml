service: audit
resource: incident
requirement: Response Admission Controller Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Dynamic Admission Control
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes cluster has dynamic admission controllers
  enabled and properly configured. It ensures that admission webhooks are set up to
  enforce security policies at runtime, thereby preventing policy violations and unauthorized
  access. A well-configured admission controller can validate and mutate API requests
  according to security policies, reducing the attack surface and ensuring compliance
  with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper admission control, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable to
  unauthorized resource configurations, leading to potential security breaches. Attackers
  could exploit misconfigurations to escalate privileges, deploy malicious workloads,
  or exfiltrate sensitive data. Admission controllers intercept API requests before
  they are persisted, providing a critical security checkpoint.
