requirement: Detection Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Kubernetes Audit Logging for Incident Detection
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes audit logging is enabled and properly
  configured to capture sufficient details about API activities. A good configuration
  includes setting the audit policy to capture relevant events, such as authentication
  failures, role changes, and resource access attempts. This helps security teams
  detect suspicious activities and respond to potential threats promptly, ensuring
  compliance with industry standards like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper audit logging, it is difficult to detect and respond to
  security incidents within a Kubernetes cluster. Misconfigured or disabled audit
  logs can allow unauthorized activities to go unnoticed, leading to potential data
  breaches or system compromises. Attackers often exploit the lack of visibility to
  perform lateral movements or privilege escalations undetected.
