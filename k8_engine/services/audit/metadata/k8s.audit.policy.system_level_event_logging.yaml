requirement: System Level Event Logging
title: Enable Detailed System Level Event Logging in Kubernetes Audit Policy
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured
  to log detailed system level events, including access to sensitive resources, changes
  to configurations, and administrative actions. A well-configured audit policy should
  capture events such as 'create', 'update', 'delete', and 'patch' for all significant
  API resources. This logging helps in identifying suspicious activities, providing
  a trail for security investigations, and ensuring compliance with security standards
  like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without detailed system level event logging, detecting unauthorized access
  and abnormal behavior becomes challenging. Attackers can exploit this lack of visibility
  to perform actions unnoticed, such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration.
  Comprehensive logging is critical for forensic analysis and timely incident response.
