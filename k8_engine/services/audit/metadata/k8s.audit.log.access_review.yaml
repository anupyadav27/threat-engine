service: audit
resource: log
requirement: Access Review
title: Ensure Audit Logs Include Access Review Events for Compliance
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to capture
  access review events, which include any actions taken by users or service accounts
  that request access to resources. A properly configured audit log should include
  records of who accessed what resources and when. This configuration helps in identifying
  anomalies, supports forensic investigations, and ensures adherence to compliance
  frameworks like PCI-DSS. A good configuration involves setting an appropriate audit
  policy that captures 'create', 'update', 'delete', and 'get' operations on sensitive
  resources.
rationale: Misconfigured audit logs can lead to undetected unauthorized access and
  privilege escalation, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities without detection.
  Ensuring access review events are logged helps track and audit access requests and
  modifications, supporting the identification of potential security incidents and
  ensuring accountability.
