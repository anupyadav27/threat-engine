service: audit
resource: software
requirement: Installation Logging Enabled
title: Enable Audit Logging for Software Installation Events
description: This control checks that audit logging is enabled and properly configured
  to capture software installation events within the Kubernetes environment. Properly
  configured audit logs should record all software installation attempts, capturing
  details such as who initiated the installation, what was installed, and when it
  occurred. This information is crucial for forensic investigations and ensuring compliance
  with security standards. It helps detect unauthorized changes and potential security
  breaches, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
rationale: Without audit logging for software installation events, unauthorized software
  changes may go undetected, increasing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities or
  malware. Attackers could exploit this lack of visibility to install malicious software
  without triggering alerts, compromising the integrity and security of the Kubernetes
  environment.
