service: audit
resource: policy
requirement: Captures User Access
title: Ensure Kubernetes Audit Logs Capture All User Access Events
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  capture all user access events, including successful and failed API requests. A
  well-configured audit policy should log details such as user identity, source IP
  address, and request path, ensuring a comprehensive record of user interactions
  with the cluster. This helps in detecting and investigating security incidents,
  enforcing accountability, and meeting compliance requirements such as PCI DSS. Proper
  audit logging aids in monitoring unauthorized access attempts and supports forensic
  analysis by providing a detailed activity trail.
rationale: Without comprehensive audit logging of user access, malicious activities
  can go undetected, allowing unauthorized access or changes to the cluster. Misconfigured
  audit policies can lead to incomplete logging, making it difficult to trace user
  actions, investigate incidents, and comply with regulatory standards. Attackers
  could exploit these gaps to perform privilege escalation or data exfiltration without
  detection.
