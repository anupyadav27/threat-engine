service: audit
resource: user
requirement: Activity Logging Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Kubernetes Audit Logging for User Activities
description: This rule checks if audit logging for user activities is enabled and
  properly configured in Kubernetes. A well-configured audit logging setup captures
  detailed records of user actions, including access to resources and modification
  events. This helps in identifying suspicious activities, supports forensic investigations,
  and ensures accountability. A proper configuration involves defining an audit policy
  that specifies which events to log and ensuring logs are securely stored and monitored.
rationale: Without proper audit logging, malicious activities or unauthorized access
  attempts by users may go undetected, leading to potential breaches. Attackers could
  exploit this lack of visibility to escalate privileges or extract sensitive data
  without leaving a trace.
