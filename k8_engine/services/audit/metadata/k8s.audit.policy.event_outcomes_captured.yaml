resource: policy
requirement: Event Outcomes Captured
title: Ensure Audit Policy Logs Event Outcomes
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  log the outcome of events, including success and failure states. Properly capturing
  event outcomes in audit logs ensures comprehensive visibility into all operations
  within the cluster. This enables security teams to monitor for unauthorized activities,
  investigate incidents effectively, and comply with industry standards such as the
  CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Failure to capture event outcomes in Kubernetes audit logs can lead to
  insufficient visibility into cluster activities, making it difficult to detect unauthorized
  access or malicious actions. Attackers could exploit this by performing actions
  without being detected, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized changes.
