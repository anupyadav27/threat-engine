requirement: Custom Rules Defined
title: Define Custom Audit Policy Rules
description: This control checks the presence and configuration of custom audit policy
  rules in Kubernetes clusters. A well-defined audit policy should capture critical
  events, such as changes to RBAC roles or access to sensitive resources, and log
  them for analysis. Implementing a tailored audit policy helps detect and respond
  to malicious activity, ensuring compliance with security standards and enhancing
  the overall security posture.
rationale: Without properly configured custom audit policy rules, Kubernetes environments
  are at risk of unauthorized changes and access going undetected. This can lead to
  security breaches via privilege escalation and unauthorized resource access.
