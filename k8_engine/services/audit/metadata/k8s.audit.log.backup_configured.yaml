requirement: Backup Configured
title: Ensure Backup of Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes audit logs are backed up in accordance
  with defined security best practices. A good configuration involves automated, regular
  backups to a secure, immutable storage location, ensuring logs are available for
  at least the duration specified by compliance mandates. This setup enhances security
  by ensuring log integrity and availability, supporting audit trails, and facilitating
  compliance with standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without properly configured backups of Kubernetes audit logs, critical
  security events may be lost, hindering incident response and forensic investigations.
  This can lead to undetected breaches, compliance violations, and a failure to understand
  the scope of security incidents. Attackers could exploit this by tampering with
  logs to cover their tracks, thus undermining the integrity of the system.
