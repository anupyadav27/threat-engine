requirement: Review Scheduled
title: Schedule Regular Reviews of Kubernetes Audit Policies
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes audit policies are configured to be
  reviewed and updated regularly. A well-scheduled review process ensures that audit
  policies remain effective and aligned with evolving security threats and compliance
  requirements. Properly configured audit policies help in identifying unauthorized
  access attempts, privilege escalations, and other suspicious activities by ensuring
  all relevant actions are logged. Regularly reviewing these policies ensures that
  the audit logs are comprehensive and the configurations reflect the current security
  posture and compliance needs.
rationale: If Kubernetes audit policies are not regularly reviewed and updated, it
  may lead to insufficient logging of critical events, allowing potential security
  incidents to go undetected. Attackers could exploit this by conducting malicious
  activities without being noticed, as outdated audit configurations might miss logging
  unauthorized access or changes.
