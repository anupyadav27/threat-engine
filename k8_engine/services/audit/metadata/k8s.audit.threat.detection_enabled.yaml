title: Enable and Configure Kubernetes Audit Logging for Threat Detection
description: This control ensures that Kubernetes auditing is enabled and configured
  accurately to capture security-relevant activities within the cluster. It validates
  that audit logs are being generated for key actions, such as authentication events,
  administrative operations, and access attempts to sensitive resources. A properly
  configured audit logging mechanism allows for monitoring and forensic investigation,
  helping to identify and mitigate potential threats. Good configuration includes
  specifying a comprehensive audit policy, securely storing logs, and integrating
  them with a monitoring solution to alert on suspicious activities.
rationale: Failure to enable and properly configure Kubernetes audit logging can result
  in undetected security breaches, as audit logs are essential for identifying unauthorized
  access and malicious activities. Without comprehensive logging, attackers can exploit
  vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the cluster without being detected,
  leading to potential data breaches or disruption of services.
