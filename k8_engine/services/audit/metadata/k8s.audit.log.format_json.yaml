requirement: Format Json
title: Enforce JSON Format for Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to use
  JSON format. Checking for JSON format ensures that logs are structured and machine-readable,
  facilitating integration with SIEM systems for real-time monitoring and alerting.
  Properly formatted logs enhance the ability to perform forensic analysis, correlate
  events, and comply with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If Kubernetes audit logs are not formatted in JSON, it can lead to inadequate
  parsing and analysis capabilities, making it difficult to detect and respond to
  security incidents. JSON format ensures structured data that can be easily integrated
  with logging and monitoring tools, enabling timely detection of unauthorized access
  attempts or configuration changes.
