requirement: Analysis Configured
title: Ensure Kubernetes Audit Logs Are Analyzed for Security Threats
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes clusters have audit log analysis configured
  to continuously monitor and scrutinize events. A properly configured log analysis
  system should parse and evaluate log data to uncover suspicious activities. Good
  configuration involves setting up log collectors and analysis tools that can alert
  on predefined security events, ensuring that logs are not only collected but also
  actively analyzed. This helps in early detection of threats and compliance with
  security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper analysis of Kubernetes audit logs, potential security breaches
  may go undetected. Attack vectors such as unauthorized access attempts, privilege
  escalation, or configuration changes could occur unnoticed, leading to severe security
  incidents. Log analysis can help identify anomalies and patterns indicative of malicious
  activities, thus enabling timely responses and mitigation strategies.
