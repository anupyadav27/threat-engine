resource: configuration
requirement: Change Detection Enabled
title: Enable Change Detection in Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This rule checks if change detection is enabled in the Kubernetes audit
  logging configuration. A good configuration involves setting 'auditPolicy' to capture
  and record changes to critical resources and configurations. This helps in tracking
  modifications, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized changes and ensuring accountability.
  Properly configured audit logs are essential for forensic analysis, compliance with
  security standards, and maintaining a secure environment.
rationale: Without change detection in audit logs, unauthorized or malicious modifications
  to the cluster configuration may go unnoticed, leading to potential security breaches.
  Attackers could exploit this by altering configurations to escalate privileges,
  exfiltrate data, or disrupt services. Change detection is crucial for timely identification
  and response to suspicious activities.
