requirement: Analysis Mechanism
title: Implement and Configure Audit Log Analysis Mechanisms
description: This control checks that an analysis mechanism is configured for Kubernetes
  audit logs, ensuring that logs are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activities.
  A good configuration includes automated log analysis tools that detect anomalies,
  alert administrators, and retain logs for an appropriate duration. This helps in
  early detection of unauthorized access, supports forensic investigations, and ensures
  compliance with security standards.
rationale: Without a properly configured audit log analysis mechanism, Kubernetes
  clusters are vulnerable to undetected malicious activities. Attackers could exploit
  this to perform unauthorized actions without leaving traces, leading to potential
  data breaches and compliance violations.
