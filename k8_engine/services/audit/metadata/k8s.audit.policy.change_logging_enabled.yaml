title: Enable and Configure Kubernetes Audit Policy for Change Logging
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  log all significant changes, including modifications to RBAC roles, cluster configurations,
  and API server interactions. A well-configured audit policy ensures all critical
  changes are recorded with sufficient detail, such as the 'metadata' and 'responseBody',
  to provide insights into who made changes, what changes were made, and when. This
  logging supports compliance with security standards and helps in identifying and
  responding to suspicious activities promptly.
rationale: Failure to enable detailed change logging in Kubernetes audit policies
  can lead to undetected unauthorized changes, which can be exploited by attackers
  to escalate privileges or compromise the cluster. Without proper logging, tracing
  malicious activities becomes challenging, hindering incident response and forensic
  analysis.
