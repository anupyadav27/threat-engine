requirement: Anomaly Detection Configured
title: Enable Anomaly Detection in Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control checks that anomaly detection is configured within the Kubernetes
  audit logging framework. Proper configuration involves setting up tools and processes
  to monitor logs for irregularities, such as unusually high access rates or attempts
  to access restricted resources. This helps in early detection of security incidents,
  enabling timely responses to mitigate potential threats and ensuring compliance
  with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without anomaly detection in audit logs, deviations from normal operations
  may go unnoticed, allowing potential security breaches such as unauthorized access
  or privilege escalation to occur undetected. Anomaly detection helps identify suspicious
  activities by analyzing patterns in the logs that could indicate a compromised system.
