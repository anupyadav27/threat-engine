requirement: Source Capture Enabled
title: Enable Source IP Capture in Kubernetes Audit Policy
description: This control checks if the Kubernetes audit policy is configured to capture
  the source IP address of requests. Proper configuration ensures that each API request's
  origin is logged, aiding in monitoring, detecting, and analyzing unauthorized or
  suspicious activities. A well-configured audit policy with source capture helps
  organizations adhere to security best practices and regulatory requirements, thereby
  reducing the risk of undetected intrusion and enhancing incident response capabilities.
rationale: Without source IP capture in audit logs, it becomes challenging to trace
  unauthorized access attempts or identify the origin of malicious activities. This
  can lead to undetected breaches or inadequate response to security incidents, as
  source information is crucial for forensic analysis and incident response.
