requirement: Notification Configured
title: Configure Notifications for Audit Incidents
description: This control checks that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to send
  notifications for specific incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts or policy
  violations. It ensures that alerts are sent to appropriate monitoring and response
  systems. A good configuration includes specifying the events that trigger notifications
  and the channels through which alerts are sent (e.g., email, Slack, SIEM systems).
  Properly configured notifications enable timely incident response, reducing the
  window of opportunity for attackers and aiding in compliance with security standards.
rationale: Without properly configured notifications for audit incidents, security
  teams may not be promptly alerted to potential security breaches or misconfigurations.
  This delay in response could allow attackers to exploit system vulnerabilities,
  leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.
