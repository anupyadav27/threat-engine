service: audit
resource: log
requirement: Failure Alert Configured
title: Configure Audit Log Failure Alerts
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes audit logs have failure alerts properly
  configured. A well-configured alert system ensures that any issues with logging,
  such as failures to write logs or unexpected log entries, are promptly reported
  to administrators. This proactive measure enables timely investigation and response,
  reducing the window of opportunity for attackers and ensuring compliance with security
  standards and regulations.
rationale: Without failure alerts configured for Kubernetes audit logs, potential
  security breaches or misconfigurations may go unnoticed, allowing malicious activities
  to persist unchecked. Attackers can exploit this lack of visibility to perform unauthorized
  actions, such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration, without detection.
