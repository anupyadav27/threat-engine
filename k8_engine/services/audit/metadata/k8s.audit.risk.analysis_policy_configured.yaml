requirement: Analysis Policy Configured
title: Enforce Audit Policy for Security Compliance
description: This control checks whether a Kubernetes audit policy is configured to
  capture critical events. A well-defined audit policy specifies which events get
  logged, such as access to sensitive resources and configuration changes, ensuring
  that any deviations from expected behavior are detected promptly. By monitoring
  these events, organizations can reduce security risks, respond quickly to incidents,
  and demonstrate compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without a properly configured audit policy, malicious activities could
  go undetected, leading to potential unauthorized access and data breaches. Attackers
  may exploit unmonitored actions to escalate privileges or exfiltrate sensitive data.
  A comprehensive audit trail is crucial for identifying suspicious behavior and ensuring
  accountability.
