resource: policy
requirement: Timestamps Included
title: Ensure Audit Logs Include Precise Timestamps
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to include
  precise timestamps for each recorded event. A well-configured audit policy should
  capture the metadata necessary to track and analyze user and system activity over
  time. Including timestamps in audit logs provides a chronological order to the events,
  which is crucial for forensic analysis, troubleshooting, and compliance with security
  standards. This configuration reduces the risk of undetected security breaches and
  aids in maintaining a secure cluster environment.
rationale: Without precise timestamps in audit logs, it becomes challenging to accurately
  reconstruct events, detect anomalies, or correlate security incidents across systems.
  This can hinder incident response efforts and leave the system vulnerable to undetected
  malicious activities. Attackers could exploit this lack of traceability to obscure
  their actions within the cluster.
