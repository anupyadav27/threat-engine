title: Ensure Audit Policy is Properly Configured
description: This control checks whether the Kubernetes audit policy is configured
  according to security best practices. It ensures that audit logs capture all necessary
  events, including authentication and authorization attempts, resource access, and
  system modifications. A well-configured audit policy helps in maintaining a comprehensive
  security monitoring system, aiding in the detection of anomalous activities and
  ensuring compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: An improperly configured audit policy in Kubernetes can lead to insufficient
  logging of critical events, making it difficult to detect and respond to security
  incidents. This can allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities without detection
  and evade accountability. Proper audit configuration helps in tracing unauthorized
  access and modifications, which is crucial for incident response and forensic analysis.
