requirement: Alerts Configured
title: Configure Alerts for Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This rule checks that alerts are configured on Kubernetes audit logs
  to ensure real-time monitoring and response to suspicious activities. A well-configured
  alerting system should notify the relevant security teams of any anomalous behavior,
  such as failed login attempts, unauthorized resource access, or changes to critical
  configurations. This aids in proactive threat detection and incident response, aligning
  with best practices and compliance with frameworks like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper alerting on audit logs, malicious activities such as unauthorized
  access attempts or privilege escalations can go unnoticed, increasing the risk of
  data breaches or system compromise. Attackers may exploit this by performing lateral
  movement within the cluster or exfiltrating sensitive data without triggering any
  immediate response.
