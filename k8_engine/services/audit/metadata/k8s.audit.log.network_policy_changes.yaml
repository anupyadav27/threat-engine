resource: log
requirement: Network Policy Changes
title: Monitor and Audit Network Policy Modifications
description: This control ensures that any changes to Kubernetes Network Policies
  are logged in the audit logs. It checks that audit policies are configured to capture
  modifications to Network Policy resources, which are crucial for defining and enforcing
  inter-pod traffic rules. By capturing these changes, administrators can detect and
  respond to unauthorized or unintended modifications, ensuring that network segmentation
  and security policies remain effective. Properly configured audit logs help maintain
  visibility into network policy changes, thereby enhancing the detection of potential
  security incidents and maintaining compliance with security best practices.
rationale: Failure to monitor and audit network policy changes can lead to undetected
  security policy misconfigurations or unauthorized modifications, potentially exposing
  sensitive services to unauthorized access and lateral movement within the cluster.
  Attackers could exploit such vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or exfiltrate
  data.
