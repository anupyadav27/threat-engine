resource: change
requirement: Management Logging Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Kubernetes Audit Logs for Management Changes
description: This control checks that Kubernetes audit logging is enabled and specifically
  configured to capture management-level changes, such as those to API server configurations,
  RBAC policies, and network policies. A properly configured audit log will include
  who made the change, what resources were affected, and the time of the change. This
  information is crucial for forensic investigations and incident response. Ensuring
  audit logs are enabled helps maintain accountability and traceability, thereby reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security standards
  like PCI DSS and SOC 2.
rationale: Without proper audit logging, unauthorized or accidental changes to Kubernetes
  configurations may go undetected, increasing the risk of configuration drift, privilege
  escalation, and data breaches. Attackers can exploit this lack of oversight to introduce
  malicious changes or maintain persistence within the cluster without being noticed.
