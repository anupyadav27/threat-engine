resource: log
requirement: Access Control Enforced
title: Enforce RBAC on Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This rule checks that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is properly configured
  to restrict access to Kubernetes audit logs. A secure configuration ensures that
  only authorized personnel can access and manage audit logs, which include sensitive
  operational data. Proper access control helps prevent unauthorized access, maintains
  the integrity of audit data, and supports compliance with security best practices
  and regulatory requirements. A good configuration involves defining roles and permissions
  that limit log access to only those with a legitimate need.
rationale: Without enforcing RBAC on Kubernetes audit logs, unauthorized users could
  gain access to sensitive log data, which may include information about cluster activities,
  attempted security breaches, and configuration details. This exposure can lead to
  insider threats, data exfiltration, and compliance violations. Attackers could use
  this information to strategize further attacks or evade detection.
