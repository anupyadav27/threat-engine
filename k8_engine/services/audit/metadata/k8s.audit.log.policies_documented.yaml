title: Ensure Kubernetes Audit Log Policies are Explicitly Defined
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes audit log policies are explicitly
  defined and configured according to security best practices. A well-configured audit
  policy ensures comprehensive logging of critical events such as access to sensitive
  resources and changes to cluster state. This helps in early detection of potential
  security incidents and supports compliance with standards like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
  Proper audit logging configuration involves specifying what events are logged, where
  logs are stored, and how they are protected against tampering.
rationale: Without explicitly defined audit log policies, there is a risk of incomplete
  or inadequate logging, which can lead to undetected malicious activities such as
  privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit these gaps
  to cover their tracks, making it difficult to conduct forensic investigations and
  comply with regulatory requirements.
