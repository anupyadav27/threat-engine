requirement: Captures Unauthorized Access
title: Ensure Comprehensive Audit Logging for Unauthorized Access
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes audit policy is configured
  to capture unauthorized access attempts comprehensively. The audit policy should
  include rules that log access denials and authentication failures, ensuring that
  any unauthorized access attempts are recorded. A well-configured audit policy helps
  in forensic analysis and compliance with security standards by providing necessary
  evidence in case of an incident. Best practices include defining clear audit policy
  rules that capture relevant events and ensure logs are retained and protected.
rationale: Without proper audit logging, unauthorized access attempts may go undetected,
  leaving the cluster vulnerable to attacks such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration.
  Comprehensive logging is crucial for detecting, responding to, and investigating
  security incidents, helping to prevent or mitigate potential breaches.
