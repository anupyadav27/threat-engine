resource: log
requirement: Protection Mechanism Configured
title: Ensure Audit Logs Are Protected with Access Controls
description: This check ensures that Kubernetes audit logs have adequate protection
  mechanisms in place, such as encryption and access controls. A well-configured audit
  log should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, and access should be restricted
  to authorized personnel only. By validating these configurations, the control helps
  prevent unauthorized access, protects sensitive data integrity, and aids in compliance
  with security standards and regulations. Properly protected audit logs also facilitate
  reliable forensic analysis in the case of a security incident.
rationale: Without proper protection mechanisms, Kubernetes audit logs are vulnerable
  to unauthorized access and tampering, which can lead to exposure of sensitive information
  and difficulty in forensic investigations. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities
  to cover their tracks or gain insights into system operations.
