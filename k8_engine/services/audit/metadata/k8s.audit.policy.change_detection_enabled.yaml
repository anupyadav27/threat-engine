requirement: Change Detection Enabled
title: Enable Change Detection in Kubernetes Audit Policies
description: This control checks if Kubernetes audit policies are configured to detect
  changes in cluster configurations. A well-configured audit policy should include
  rules that log any modifications to critical resources, such as roles, role bindings,
  and cluster roles. This helps in early detection of unauthorized changes, aiding
  in rapid incident response and forensic investigations. Compliance with this control
  ensures that any unauthorized or accidental modifications are logged and can be
  traced back to their source, thereby enhancing overall security posture.
rationale: Without change detection, unauthorized modifications to configurations
  can go unnoticed, leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions. Attackers
  can exploit this to escalate privileges or persist within the cluster undetected.
