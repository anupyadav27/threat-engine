rule_id: k8s.audit.log.timestamps_configured
service: audit
resource: log
requirement: Timestamps Configured
title: Ensure Audit Logs Include Timestamps
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes audit logs are configured to include
  precise timestamps for each logged event. A proper configuration mandates that each
  log entry is timestamped, enabling accurate event correlation and sequence analysis.
  This helps in quickly identifying breaches or misconfigurations, ensuring that incident
  response teams have the necessary information to act. Proper timestamp configuration
  aligns with security best practices and regulatory standards such as CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark, promoting a robust security posture.
rationale: Without timestamps, correlating and analyzing audit logs becomes difficult,
  impeding the detection and response to unauthorized access or configuration changes.
  Timestamps are crucial for forensic investigations and maintaining chronological
  order in security audits. Attackers may exploit systems with inadequate logging
  to obscure their actions and persistence.
