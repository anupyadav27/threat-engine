requirement: Retention Days Specified
title: Specify Retention Period for Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control checks that a retention period is specified for Kubernetes
  audit logs. A well-configured retention policy ensures that audit logs are kept
  for a defined period, allowing for adequate monitoring and analysis of system activities.
  Proper configuration involves setting a specific number of days for which logs should
  be retained, balancing between storage costs and the need for historical data. This
  helps in maintaining an audit trail, facilitating compliance with standards like
  the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, and enhancing the overall security posture by ensuring
  logs are available for audits and investigations.
rationale: Without a specified retention period for audit logs, critical security
  events may be lost over time, hindering incident response and forensic investigations.
  Attackers could exploit this by deliberately performing actions that go unnoticed
  due to the lack of historical audit data. Specifying retention days ensures that
  logs are retained for a sufficient period to detect suspicious activities and comply
  with regulatory requirements.
