resource: log
requirement: Monitoring Configured
title: Ensure Audit Log Monitoring is Enabled and Configured
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes audit logs are actively monitored and
  configured according to security best practices. A well-configured audit logging
  system captures all significant events, such as API calls, access attempts, and
  configuration changes. It ensures that logs are stored securely and analyzed continuously
  for suspicious activities. This helps in early detection of security incidents,
  compliance with regulatory standards, and maintaining the integrity of the cluster.
rationale: Failure to monitor Kubernetes audit logs can lead to undetected security
  breaches and unauthorized access. Attackers may exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities
  without leaving a trace, making it difficult to respond to incidents. Proper log
  monitoring aids in the detection of anomalies and potential threats in real-time,
  enabling prompt response and mitigation.
