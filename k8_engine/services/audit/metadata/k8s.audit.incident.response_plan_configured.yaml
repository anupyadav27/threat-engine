requirement: Response Plan Configured
title: Ensure Incident Response Plan is Configured for Kubernetes Audit Logs
description: This control checks that a defined incident response plan is in place
  for handling Kubernetes audit logs. It ensures that there are procedures for identifying,
  analyzing, and responding to security incidents identified in audit logs. A well-configured
  plan includes automated alerts, incident categorization, and escalation procedures,
  which help in minimizing the impact of security events and ensuring compliance with
  industry standards.
rationale: Without a properly configured incident response plan for Kubernetes audit
  logs, organizations might fail to detect or respond to security incidents promptly,
  leading to prolonged exposure to threats and potential data breaches. Misconfiguration
  may allow attackers to exploit unknown vulnerabilities or unauthorized access attempts
  without quick mitigation.
