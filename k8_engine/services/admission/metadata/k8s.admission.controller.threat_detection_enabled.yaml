rule_id: k8s.admission.controller.threat_detection_enabled
service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Threat Detection Enabled
title: Enable Threat Detection in Admission Controllers
description: This rule verifies that threat detection is enabled in Kubernetes admission
  controllers by checking configurations for tools that monitor and log suspicious
  activities. A well-configured threat detection mechanism analyzes admission requests
  in real-time, alerting administrators to potential security breaches and unauthorized
  access attempts. By ensuring threat detection is active, clusters benefit from enhanced
  visibility into security events, enabling proactive incident response and compliance
  with security benchmarks like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without threat detection enabled in Kubernetes admission controllers, malicious
  activities such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and resource tampering
  could go undetected, posing significant risks to cluster integrity and data confidentiality.
  Attackers can exploit misconfigured admission controllers to introduce vulnerable
  or malicious configurations, compromising cluster security.
