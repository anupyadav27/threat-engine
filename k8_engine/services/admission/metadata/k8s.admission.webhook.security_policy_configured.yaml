service: admission
resource: webhook
requirement: Security Policy Configured
title: Ensure Admission Webhooks Enforce Security Policies
description: This control checks that admission webhooks are configured with security
  policies that enforce best practices and compliance requirements. A well-configured
  webhook ensures that any incoming API requests are evaluated against security policies
  before they are allowed to persist in the cluster. This reduces the attack surface
  by preventing the deployment of insecure or non-compliant workloads. The configuration
  should include criteria that align with organizational security standards, such
  as disallowing containers with privileged escalation or enforcing network policies.
  Proper implementation of these policies ensures adherence to the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark and other industry standards.
rationale: Without properly configured admission webhooks, Kubernetes clusters are
  vulnerable to misconfigurations and malicious activities. Attackers can exploit
  these vulnerabilities to execute unauthorized code, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate
  sensitive data. Enforcing security policies through admission webhooks helps mitigate
  these risks by ensuring that all deployed resources adhere to predefined security
  standards.
