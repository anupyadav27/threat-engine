service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Policy Violation Alerts Enabled
title: Enable Policy Violation Alerts in Admission Controllers
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes admission controller is configured
  to generate alerts for policy violations. A properly configured alert system helps
  in real-time detection and response to unauthorized configuration changes and access
  attempts. Ensuring alerts are enabled and properly configured helps maintain adherence
  to security policies, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents and ensuring
  compliance with standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without policy violation alerts, unauthorized configurations may go undetected,
  allowing potential security breaches and policy non-compliance. Attackers could
  exploit these misconfigurations to bypass security policies, leading to data exposure
  or system compromise.
