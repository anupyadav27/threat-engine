service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Antimalware Policies Enforced
title: Enforce Antimalware Policies via Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes admission controllers are configured
  to enforce antimalware policies, ensuring that only trusted and verified images
  are deployed. A properly configured admission controller will validate metadata
  and scan images for known vulnerabilities before allowing them into the cluster,
  thereby reducing the risk of malware infiltration. This configuration enhances security
  by preventing the execution of unverified or compromised code and helps in maintaining
  compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without enforced antimalware policies, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable
  to malicious images and applications, potentially leading to unauthorized access,
  data exfiltration, or service disruption. Attackers can exploit this by deploying
  compromised container images or injecting malware into running applications, jeopardizing
  cluster integrity and compliance with security standards.
