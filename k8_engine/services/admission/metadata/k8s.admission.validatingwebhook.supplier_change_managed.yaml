rule_id: k8s.admission.validatingwebhook.supplier_change_managed
service: admission
resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Supplier Change Managed
title: Ensure ValidatingWebhookConfiguration Supplier Change is Securely Managed
description: This rule checks that any changes to the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
  supplier are managed securely according to best practices. A secure configuration
  involves using version-controlled and audited webhook configurations, ensuring that
  any updates are authorized and verified by security teams. This helps in maintaining
  the integrity of the admission control process, preventing unauthorized access or
  modifications to cluster configurations, and aligning with industry standards such
  as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfiguration of the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration can lead to unauthorized
  changes being applied to the cluster, potentially allowing attackers to introduce
  malicious configurations or bypass security policies. This can result in privilege
  escalation, data breaches, or unauthorized access to cluster resources. Proper management
  of supplier changes ensures that only trusted and verified updates are applied,
  mitigating these risks.
