rule_id: k8s.admission.validatingwebhook.control_hostpath_volumes_restricted
service: admission
resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Control Hostpath Volumes Restricted
title: Restrict HostPath Volume Usage via Admission Webhooks
description: This rule checks that admission webhooks are configured to restrict the
  use of HostPath volumes in Kubernetes clusters. Limiting HostPath volumes helps
  ensure that only authorized applications can access specific directories on the
  host filesystem, reducing the risk of privilege escalations and data breaches. A
  well-configured admission webhook will enforce policies that prevent unauthorized
  or unintended use of HostPath volumes, aligning with security best practices and
  compliance requirements.
rationale: Improper configuration of HostPath volumes can lead to unauthorized access
  to the host filesystem, increasing the risk of data exfiltration and privilege escalation.
  By restricting HostPath volume usage, you minimize the attack surface and prevent
  potential exploits where attackers could manipulate or access sensitive data on
  the host.
