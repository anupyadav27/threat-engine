service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Vulnerability Scanning Enabled
title: Enable Vulnerability Scanning in Admission Controllers
description: This control verifies that vulnerability scanning is actively configured
  in Kubernetes admission controllers to screen container images for known security
  issues before they are deployed. A good configuration involves integrating a security
  scanner that checks images against a database of known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and
  enforces policies to block images that fail these checks. This helps maintain a
  secure environment by preventing the deployment of insecure images, ensuring compliance
  with security standards, and reducing the attack surface.
rationale: Without vulnerability scanning enabled in admission controllers, Kubernetes
  clusters are susceptible to deploying vulnerable or malicious container images.
  This increases the risk of exploitation through unpatched vulnerabilities, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions. Attack vectors
  include the deployment of outdated images with known CVEs or the introduction of
  malicious code into running environments.
