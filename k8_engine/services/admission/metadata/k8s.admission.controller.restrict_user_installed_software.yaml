service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Restrict User Installed Software
title: Enforce Admission Control to Restrict User-Installed Software
description: This rule checks the configuration of admission controllers to ensure
  they are set to restrict the installation of user-supplied software. Proper configuration
  involves setting up policies that prevent unauthorized software from being installed
  on the cluster. This is achieved by using admission controllers like PodSecurityPolicy
  or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce security policies that validate and limit
  the software users can install. This control helps maintain a secure environment
  by reducing the attack surface and ensuring that only vetted and approved software
  is deployed within the cluster.
rationale: Allowing arbitrary software installation by users on Kubernetes clusters
  can introduce vulnerabilities, enable privilege escalation, and compromise the integrity
  of workloads. By misconfiguring admission controllers, attackers could exploit these
  vulnerabilities to execute unauthorized software, potentially leading to data breaches,
  denial of service, or other malicious activities.
