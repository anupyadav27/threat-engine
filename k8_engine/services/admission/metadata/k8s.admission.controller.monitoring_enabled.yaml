requirement: Monitoring Enabled
title: Enable and Monitor Admission Controller for Security Threats
description: This control verifies that monitoring is enabled on the Kubernetes admission
  controller. It checks for the presence of logging and alerting mechanisms that can
  detect anomalies and unauthorized attempts to access or modify resources. A well-monitored
  admission controller can quickly identify and respond to suspicious activities,
  thereby minimizing the risk of security breaches. Good configuration involves implementing
  logging to track requests and responses, integrating with a central monitoring system,
  and setting up alerts for unusual patterns or failures.
rationale: Without proper monitoring of the Kubernetes admission controller, malicious
  activities could go undetected, leading to potential unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, or denial of service attacks. Attackers may exploit unmonitored systems
  to manipulate workloads or gain access to sensitive resources.
