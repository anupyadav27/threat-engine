service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Incident Reporting Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Audit Logging in Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled and correctly configured
  in Kubernetes admission controllers. Proper configuration involves setting up audit
  policies that log key events such as changes to resource configurations and access
  attempts. A well-configured audit logging system helps in tracking incidents, enabling
  forensic analysis in the event of a security breach, and ensuring compliance with
  security standards like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper incident reporting via audit logging in admission controllers,
  unauthorized or malicious changes to workloads and configurations may go undetected,
  increasing the risk of security breaches. Attackers could exploit this to escalate
  privileges, execute unauthorized operations, or deploy harmful workloads without
  detection.
