rule_id: k8s.admission.validatingwebhook.controller_security_patches_enforced
service: admission
resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Controller Security Patches Enforced
title: Enforce Security Patch Validation on Admission Controllers
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes validating webhooks are configured
  to enforce the application of security patches for admission controllers. A correctly
  configured system should ensure that only patched and verified versions of admission
  controllers are in use, reducing the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
  This validation checks the configurations of validating webhooks to ensure they
  are up-to-date with security patches. Proper enforcement helps maintain the integrity
  of the cluster by preventing compromised admission controllers from approving insecure
  operations or configurations.
rationale: Failing to enforce security patches on validating webhooks can expose the
  Kubernetes cluster to vulnerabilities that have already been addressed in updates.
  These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access,
  execute arbitrary code, or disrupt services. Unpatched admission controllers may
  fail to block malicious or misconfigured resources, compromising the entire cluster's
  security.
