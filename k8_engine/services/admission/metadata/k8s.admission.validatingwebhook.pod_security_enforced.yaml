service: admission
resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Pod Security Enforced
title: Enforce Pod Security Standards via Validating Webhooks
description: This rule checks if pod security standards are enforced via Kubernetes
  validating webhooks. A validating webhook intercepts the pod creation process and
  ensures that security policies, such as restricting privileged mode or host network
  access, are adhered to. Proper configuration helps prevent unauthorized access,
  privilege escalation, and ensures compliance with industry standards like the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark. A compliant setup involves defining security policies and
  configuring webhooks to reject non-compliant pod specifications.
rationale: Misconfiguration of pod security can lead to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and data breaches. Attack vectors include running privileged containers,
  accessing host resources, and bypassing network policies. Enforcing pod security
  through validating webhooks ensures that pods comply with security policies before
  they are admitted, mitigating these risks.
