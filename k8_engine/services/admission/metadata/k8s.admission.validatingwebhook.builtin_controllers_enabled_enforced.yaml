title: Enforce Built-in Admission Controllers in ValidatingWebhooks
description: This control checks that Kubernetes ValidatingWebhooks have built-in
  admission controllers enabled and enforced according to official security guidelines.
  Proper enforcement ensures that all API requests are subjected to necessary validation
  checks, reducing the risk of unauthorized or harmful changes. An optimal configuration
  helps maintain cluster integrity, adheres to best practices, and aligns with compliance
  frameworks such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If built-in admission controllers are not properly enforced in ValidatingWebhooks,
  Kubernetes clusters may be vulnerable to misconfigurations and unauthorized changes.
  Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, deploy malicious
  workloads, or alter cluster configurations, undermining security and compliance
  efforts.
