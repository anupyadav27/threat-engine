requirement: Antivirus Enabled
title: Enable Antivirus on Admission Controllers
description: This control checks if antivirus software is enabled and properly configured
  on Kubernetes admission controllers. A well-configured antivirus solution helps
  detect and block malicious payloads during the admission phase, preventing harmful
  resources from entering the cluster. A good configuration involves integrating antivirus
  solutions that scan for known malware signatures and provide real-time protection.
  This enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that any resource created
  or modified within the cluster is free from malware, thus safeguarding against potential
  security breaches.
rationale: Without antivirus protection on admission controllers, Kubernetes clusters
  are vulnerable to malware and malicious code injection during resource creation
  and modification. Attackers can exploit this to gain unauthorized access, cause
  data breaches, or execute arbitrary code within the cluster, impacting confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability.
