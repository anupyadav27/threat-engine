requirement: Change Control Enabled
title: Enable Change Control in Kubernetes Admission Controllers
description: This control checks that change control mechanisms are active within
  Kubernetes admission controllers. Proper configuration involves ensuring that all
  changes to admission controller policies are logged, reviewed, and authorized before
  deployment. This reduces the risk of unauthorized changes and helps maintain compliance
  with security standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A well-configured change
  control process prevents unauthorized access by enforcing policy validations at
  the admission level, thereby ensuring that only secure and compliant workloads are
  admitted into the cluster.
rationale: Without change control in admission controllers, unauthorized or accidental
  configuration changes can be introduced, leading to potential security vulnerabilities,
  data breaches, or compliance violations. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the cluster.
