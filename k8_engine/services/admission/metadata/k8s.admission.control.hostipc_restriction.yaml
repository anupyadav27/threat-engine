rule_id: k8s.admission.control.hostipc_restriction
service: admission
resource: control
requirement: Hostipc Restriction
title: Restrict HostIPC Namespace Access in Pods
description: This rule checks whether the HostIPC field is set to false in pod specifications,
  preventing pods from sharing the host's IPC namespace. A secure configuration ensures
  that pods cannot access or manipulate host-level processes through the IPC namespace,
  reducing the risk of privilege escalation and maintaining the isolation between
  pods and the host. This control aligns with security best practices outlined in
  the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and helps ensure compliance with cluster security policies.
rationale: Enabling HostIPC allows a pod to share the host's IPC namespace, which
  can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized inter-process communication. If
  misconfigured, attackers could exploit this to snoop on or interfere with host-level
  processes, compromising node security and potentially escalating permissions across
  the cluster.
