requirement: Configuration Validated
title: Ensure Proper Configuration of Admission Controllers
description: This control checks that admission controllers in the Kubernetes cluster
  are configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration involves
  ensuring that admission controllers are enabled, ordered, and parameterized correctly
  to enforce security policies. This includes validating resource requests, ensuring
  compliance with security policies, and preventing the deployment of misconfigured
  or malicious workloads. A well-configured admission controller setup reduces attack
  surfaces by enforcing strict adherence to organizational security policies before
  workloads are admitted to the cluster.
rationale: Misconfigured admission controllers can lead to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and potential denial of service attacks. Attackers can exploit improperly
  configured controllers to bypass security policies, inject malicious configurations,
  and compromise cluster integrity.
