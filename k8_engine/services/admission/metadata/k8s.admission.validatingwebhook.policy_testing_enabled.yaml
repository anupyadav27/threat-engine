requirement: Policy Testing Enabled
title: Enable Policy Testing in Admission Validating Webhooks
description: This control checks that the admission validating webhooks in the Kubernetes
  cluster have policy testing enabled. A properly configured validating webhook ensures
  that all resources comply with security policies before they are admitted to the
  cluster. This helps prevent unauthorized or insecure configurations from being deployed,
  by rejecting requests that do not meet the security criteria. For example, it can
  enforce policies that restrict the use of certain images, require specific labels,
  or limit resource requests and limits. A good configuration includes setting up
  the webhook to evaluate requests against a set of predefined policies and reject
  those that do not comply, thus maintaining a secure cluster environment.
rationale: Without policy testing enabled in admission validating webhooks, there
  is a risk of deploying misconfigured or malicious workloads into the cluster. Attackers
  could exploit this by bypassing security policies, potentially escalating their
  privileges or accessing sensitive data. Enabling policy testing helps ensure that
  all workloads meet predefined security criteria before deployment, reducing the
  surface for such exploits.
