service: admission
resource: mutatingwebhook
requirement: Secure Webhooks Enforced Enabled
title: Enforce TLS in Mutating Admission Webhooks
description: This rule checks that all mutating admission webhooks enforce TLS by
  verifying that the webhook configurations specify a 'caBundle' and that the 'url'
  scheme is 'https'. A secure configuration ensures that communication between the
  API server and webhooks is encrypted, mitigating risks of data interception and
  ensuring data integrity. Properly configured TLS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
  and ensures that only authorized endpoints can interact with the webhooks.
rationale: If TLS is not enforced for mutating admission webhooks, sensitive data
  transmitted between the Kubernetes API server and webhooks may be exposed to interception
  or tampering by unauthorized entities. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized
  modifications of Kubernetes resources, potentially resulting in privilege escalation
  or denial of service attacks.
