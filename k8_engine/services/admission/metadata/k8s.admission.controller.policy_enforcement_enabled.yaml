rule_id: k8s.admission.controller.policy_enforcement_enabled
service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Policy Enforcement Enabled
title: Enforce Pod Security Policies with Admission Controllers
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes admission controllers are configured
  to enforce Pod Security Policies (PSPs) or their replacements like the Pod Security
  Admission feature. It ensures that policies are correctly applied to control the
  security context of pods, restricting actions like running as privileged or using
  host namespaces. Proper configuration of admission controllers mitigates risks of
  privilege escalation and unauthorized access, enhancing the overall security posture
  of the cluster.
rationale: Without policy enforcement, Kubernetes clusters are vulnerable to security
  misconfigurations that could allow attackers to escalate privileges, execute unauthorized
  code, or access sensitive data. Attack vectors include deploying malicious containers,
  privilege escalation through unrestricted capabilities, and bypassing network policies.
