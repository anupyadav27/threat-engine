resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Webhook Validation Enabled
title: Enable and Configure Validating Webhooks for Admission Control
description: This control checks that Kubernetes validating admission webhooks are
  enabled and properly configured to enforce security policies on resource creation
  and updates. A well-configured validating webhook ensures that only compliant and
  secure configurations are allowed into the cluster. This prevents unsafe configurations,
  unauthorized resource creation, and ultimately helps maintain the integrity and
  security of the cluster. Proper configuration involves specifying secure endpoints,
  ensuring SSL/TLS encryption for communication, and defining precise webhook rules
  that align with security policies.
rationale: If validating webhooks are not properly enabled and configured, malicious
  actors could exploit improperly validated resources to gain unauthorized access
  or execute unauthorized actions in the cluster. This could lead to privilege escalation,
  data breaches, or service disruptions. Validating webhooks act as a critical security
  checkpoint by enforcing custom policies on incoming resource requests, thereby protecting
  the cluster from misconfigurations and potential attacks.
