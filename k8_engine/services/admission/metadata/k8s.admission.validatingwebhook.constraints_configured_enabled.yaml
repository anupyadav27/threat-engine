resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Constraints Configured Enabled
title: Ensure Validating Webhook Configurations Enforce Security Policies
description: This control checks that all configured validating webhooks have their
  constraints properly set and enabled. A good configuration ensures that the webhook
  validates incoming API requests against defined security policies before they are
  persisted in the cluster. This helps prevent the introduction of resources that
  violate security policies, such as pods with elevated privileges or unauthorized
  network access, thereby maintaining the cluster's integrity and compliance with
  security best practices.
rationale: If a validating webhook is misconfigured or lacks necessary constraints,
  it can allow the admission of insecure or misconfigured resources into the Kubernetes
  cluster. This can lead to potential security breaches, such as privilege escalation
  or resource misuse, by permitting operations that should be restricted. By ensuring
  constraints are properly configured and enabled, you mitigate the risk of introducing
  vulnerabilities through improperly validated configurations.
