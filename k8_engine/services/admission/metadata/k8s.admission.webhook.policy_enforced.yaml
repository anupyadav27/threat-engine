service: admission
resource: webhook
requirement: Policy Enforced
title: Enforce Admission Webhook Security Policies
description: This control checks that admission webhooks enforce security policies
  by ensuring they are correctly configured with fail-open or fail-closed settings,
  depending on the environment's requirements. Proper configuration ensures that policy
  violations are detected and mitigated before resources are created or modified,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and ensuring compliance with security
  standards. A well-configured webhook policy enforces checks on resource creation
  and updates, preventing misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
rationale: Misconfigured admission webhooks may be exploited by attackers to bypass
  security controls, leading to unauthorized resource manipulation or privilege escalation.
  Proper enforcement is crucial to prevent attack vectors such as injection of malicious
  resources or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
