requirement: Detection Webhook Configured
title: Configure Admission Control Threat Detection Webhooks
description: This control checks that Kubernetes admission control webhooks are properly
  configured to detect and log security threats. A well-configured webhook will monitor
  and validate incoming API requests to the Kubernetes API server, ensuring they comply
  with security policies. Proper configuration involves setting up webhook endpoints
  with secure communication channels, defining clear policy rules, and maintaining
  audit logs. This helps in early detection of potentially malicious activities, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security standards.
rationale: Improperly configured admission control webhooks can lead to unauthorized
  access and execution of malicious actions within the cluster. Attackers can exploit
  misconfigurations to bypass security policies, inject malicious workloads, or escalate
  privileges, compromising the integrity and availability of the cluster.
