service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Security Policy Enabled
title: Enable Pod Security Policies via Admission Controller
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes admission controller has Pod Security
  Policies (PSP) enabled to enforce security best practices at the admission stage.
  A properly configured PSP ensures that pods conform to security policies, such as
  restricting privilege escalation, disallowing host network and volume access, and
  enforcing resource limits. This reduces the attack surface by preventing the deployment
  of containers with insecure configurations and helps maintain compliance with standards
  like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A correct configuration includes having PSP admission
  control enabled and specific security policies defined and enforced for different
  workloads.
rationale: If Pod Security Policies are not enabled through the admission controller,
  there is an increased risk of deploying pods that can escalate privileges within
  the cluster. This misconfiguration can allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities
  by running privileged containers, accessing host resources, or mounting sensitive
  host paths, exposing the cluster to potential attacks and unauthorized access.
