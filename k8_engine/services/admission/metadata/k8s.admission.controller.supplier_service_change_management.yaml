rule_id: k8s.admission.controller.supplier_service_change_management
service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Supplier Service Change Management
title: Enforce Change Management on Admission Controllers
description: This rule verifies that a change management process is enforced on Kubernetes
  admission controllers, ensuring that any modifications are reviewed and approved
  according to security policies. Proper configuration includes documenting and controlling
  changes to admission controllers, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access
  and ensures compliance with industry standards. This control helps maintain a robust
  security posture by preventing unverified changes that could weaken the cluster's
  defenses.
rationale: Without proper change management controls in place, unauthorized or unverified
  changes to admission controllers can introduce vulnerabilities, leading to potential
  breaches and non-compliance with security standards. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  to bypass security policies, escalating privileges or executing malicious operations
  within the cluster.
