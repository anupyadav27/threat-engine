rule_id: k8s.admission.controller.changes_monitored
service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Changes Monitored
title: Monitor and Audit Admission Controller Configuration Changes
description: This rule ensures that any configuration changes made to the Kubernetes
  admission controllers are monitored and logged. By validating that audit logs are
  enabled and properly configured, it helps detect unauthorized modifications and
  policy violations promptly. A good configuration includes enabling audit logging
  for all admission controller changes, ensuring log integrity, and regularly reviewing
  logs for suspicious activities. This vigilance is crucial for identifying potential
  security incidents early and maintaining compliance with standards such as the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without monitoring changes to admission controllers, malicious actors could
  modify policies to allow unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the cluster.
  This exposure increases the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with security
  standards.
