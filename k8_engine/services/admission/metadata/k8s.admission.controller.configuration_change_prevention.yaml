service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Configuration Change Prevention
title: Ensure Immutable Admission Controller Configurations
description: This control checks that Kubernetes admission controllers are configured
  with mechanisms to prevent unauthorized changes. A secure configuration involves
  setting up admission controllers with immutable configurations, ensuring that once
  they are deployed, changes require proper authorization and review. This protects
  against accidental or malicious alterations that could weaken security policies,
  preventing potential breaches and ensuring compliance with standards like the CIS
  Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfigured admission controllers can lead to unauthorized configuration
  changes, increasing the risk of privilege escalation, data breaches, and compliance
  violations. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious configurations
  or bypass security policies, compromising the cluster's integrity and confidentiality.
