requirement: Security Alerting Enabled
title: Enable Security Alerting for Admission Validating Webhooks
description: This control checks if security alerting is enabled for admission validating
  webhooks. A well-configured alerting system ensures that any unauthorized or unexpected
  changes to webhook configurations are promptly detected and investigated. This involves
  setting up logging and monitoring to track webhook events and integrating alerts
  with a centralized monitoring system. Proper alerting helps maintain the integrity
  of admission controls, which are crucial for enforcing security policies across
  the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Without proper security alerting for admission validating webhooks, unauthorized
  changes can go undetected, leading to potential security breaches. Attackers could
  exploit misconfigured webhooks to bypass security policies, leading to data leaks
  or unauthorized access to resources.
