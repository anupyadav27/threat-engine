service: admission
resource: control
requirement: Hostpath Volumes Restricted
title: Restrict HostPath Volume Usage in Kubernetes Admission Control
description: This control checks that HostPath volume usage is restricted through
  Kubernetes admission control policies. It ensures that only explicitly permitted
  pods can use HostPath volumes, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  to the host's filesystem. A well-configured policy will specify conditions or namespaces
  where HostPath volumes are permissible, adhering to security best practices and
  compliance requirements. Validating this control helps enforce a secure boundary
  between containerized applications and the host, mitigating risks associated with
  privilege escalation and data breaches.
rationale: Allowing unrestricted HostPath volumes can lead to severe security vulnerabilities
  as they provide pods with direct access to the node's filesystem, potentially allowing
  for unauthorized data access and privilege escalation. Attackers could exploit this
  to overwrite critical system files or access sensitive information, compromising
  the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
