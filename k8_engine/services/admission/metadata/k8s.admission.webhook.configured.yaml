requirement: Configured
title: Enforce Admission Webhook Configuration for Enhanced Security
description: This control checks that Kubernetes admission webhooks are properly configured
  according to security best practices. A well-configured webhook ensures that all
  requests to the API server are subject to validation and mutation policies, effectively
  preventing unauthorized resource creation or modification. This includes ensuring
  the webhook is registered correctly, with secure endpoints using TLS, and that it
  evaluates critical security policies, such as resource quotas and pod security standards.
  Proper configuration significantly reduces attack surfaces and enforces compliance
  with industry standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Misconfigured admission webhooks can lead to significant security risks,
  including unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Attackers could exploit
  improperly configured webhooks to bypass security policies, inject malicious resources,
  or perform unauthorized operations within the cluster, compromising the integrity
  and confidentiality of the Kubernetes environment.
