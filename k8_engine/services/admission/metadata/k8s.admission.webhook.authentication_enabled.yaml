service: admission
resource: webhook
requirement: Authentication Enabled
title: Ensure Authentication for Admission Webhooks
description: This control checks that Kubernetes admission webhooks have authentication
  enabled, ensuring that only authenticated requests are processed. A properly configured
  webhook should leverage mechanisms like client certificates or token-based authentication
  to verify the identity of the requestor. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access
  and ensures that only validated and approved configurations are applied, aligning
  with security best practices and regulatory compliance such as the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without proper authentication, admission webhooks are vulnerable to unauthorized
  requests, which can lead to the execution of unauthorized operations or policy violations.
  Attackers could exploit unauthenticated webhooks to bypass security controls, resulting
  in potential data breaches or service disruptions.
