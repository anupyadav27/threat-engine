rule_id: k8s.admission.validatingwebhook.controller_configuration_immutable
service: admission
resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: Controller Configuration Immutable
title: Ensure ValidatingWebhookConfigurations Are Immutable
description: 'This rule checks that Kubernetes ValidatingWebhookConfigurations are
  configured to be immutable, meaning their configuration cannot be altered after
  initial creation. An immutable configuration ensures that once the webhook is set
  to enforce certain security policies, those policies cannot be changed without explicit
  intent. This protects against accidental or malicious changes that could weaken
  security postures, such as disabling critical admission controls that validate resources
  before they are persisted. A secure configuration involves enabling the ''failurePolicy:
  Fail'' setting to ensure requests that cannot be validated are denied, maintaining
  the integrity and security of the cluster.'
rationale: If ValidatingWebhookConfigurations are not immutable, an attacker or a
  misconfigured application with elevated permissions could modify the webhook's behavior,
  potentially allowing unauthorized access or bypassing critical security checks.
  This could lead to privilege escalation, unauthorized resource access, or denial
  of service attacks by preventing essential security validations.
