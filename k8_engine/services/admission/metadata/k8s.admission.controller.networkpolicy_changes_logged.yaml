service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Networkpolicy Changes Logged
title: Log All NetworkPolicy Changes via Admission Controllers
description: This control verifies that the Kubernetes admission controller is configured
  to log all changes to NetworkPolicies. A secure configuration ensures that every
  alteration to network policies is recorded, allowing for auditing and monitoring
  of network access controls. This not only helps in identifying malicious changes
  but also aids in compliance with security standards. A well-configured logging mechanism
  ensures that any unauthorized or suspicious changes are promptly detected and addressed,
  thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the cluster's network configuration.
rationale: Logging NetworkPolicy changes is crucial to detect and prevent potential
  security breaches such as unauthorized network access and data exfiltration. Without
  proper logging, adversaries can modify network policies to allow unauthorized access,
  leading to lateral movement within the cluster and potential data leaks.
