service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Software Whitelist Enabled
title: Enforce Software Whitelisting in Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes admission controller is configured
  to enforce a software whitelist, ensuring only approved images and software packages
  are deployed. A properly configured whitelist prevents unauthorized applications
  from running, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents and maintaining compliance
  with security standards. It involves validating the presence of a whitelist policy
  that specifies allowed images and denies any that are not explicitly listed.
rationale: Without a software whitelist, unauthorized or malicious software can be
  deployed within the cluster, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
  Attackers could exploit this by deploying containers with backdoors or known vulnerabilities,
  enabling lateral movement or privilege escalation within the cluster.
