rule_id: k8s.admission.mutatingwebhook.webhook_tls_enforced
service: admission
resource: mutatingwebhook
requirement: Webhook Tls Enforced
title: Enforce TLS for MutatingWebhook Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks that all MutatingWebhook configurations enforce TLS
  by ensuring that the 'clientConfig' field specifies 'caBundle' or a trusted CA.
  Proper TLS configuration ensures that communication between the Kubernetes API server
  and the webhook is encrypted, preventing interception and unauthorized modifications
  of admission requests. This protects sensitive data in transit and aligns with security
  best practices and compliance standards.
rationale: If TLS is not enforced for MutatingWebhook admission controllers, data
  transmitted between the API server and webhooks may be susceptible to eavesdropping
  or man-in-the-middle attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access or tampering
  with requests, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the Kubernetes
  cluster.
