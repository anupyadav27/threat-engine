requirement: Threat Hunting Enabled
title: Enable Threat Detection in Admission Controllers
description: This control checks if threat detection mechanisms are enabled in Kubernetes
  admission controllers. A correctly configured admission controller can intercept
  API requests in real-time and enforce security policies or detect anomalies. A good
  configuration involves enabling specific admission plugins that support threat detection,
  such as validating and mutating webhooks, which help to scrutinize incoming and
  outgoing traffic for suspicious activities and enforce security policies effectively.
  This enhances the overall security posture by preventing potential breaches and
  ensuring compliance with security standards.
rationale: Without threat detection enabled in admission controllers, Kubernetes clusters
  may become vulnerable to attacks that exploit misconfigurations or unauthorized
  access attempts. Attack vectors include privilege escalation, execution of malicious
  containers, and unauthorized changes to resources. Ensuring threat detection is
  active helps identify and mitigate these risks before they can be exploited.
