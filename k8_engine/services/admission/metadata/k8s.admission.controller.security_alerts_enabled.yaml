requirement: Security Alerts Enabled
title: Enable Security Alerts in Admission Controllers
description: This control checks that the admission controllers in Kubernetes clusters
  have security alerts enabled. A well-configured alert system will notify administrators
  of any unauthorized access attempts or policy violations, allowing for timely remediation.
  Proper configuration includes setting up alerts for critical security events, ensuring
  they are monitored continuously, and integrating them with incident response processes.
  This reduces the risk of undetected security incidents and aids in compliance with
  standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If security alerts are improperly configured or disabled, malicious activities
  or misconfigurations can go unnoticed, leading to potential breaches. Attackers
  may exploit this by injecting malicious configurations or bypassing security policies
  without detection.
