requirement: Memory Protection Policies Enforced
title: Enforce Memory Protection Policies in Admission Controllers
description: This control checks that memory protection policies are enforced within
  Kubernetes admission controllers. It ensures that configurations adhere to security
  best practices by preventing excessive memory usage and unauthorized memory access.
  A correctly configured admission controller will apply constraints that limit the
  memory resources a pod can utilize, reducing the risk of Denial of Service (DoS)
  attacks and ensuring stable cluster performance.
rationale: Misconfiguring memory protection policies can lead to vulnerabilities such
  as unauthorized memory access, which attackers can exploit to execute malicious
  code or exfiltrate sensitive data. Proper enforcement is crucial to mitigate risks
  like privilege escalation and maintain system integrity.
