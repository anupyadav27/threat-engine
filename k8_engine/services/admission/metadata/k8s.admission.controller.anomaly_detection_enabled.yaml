requirement: Anomaly Detection Enabled
title: Enable Anomaly Detection in Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks whether anomaly detection is enabled in Kubernetes admission
  controllers. Proper configuration involves integrating anomaly detection mechanisms
  that monitor and alert on unusual patterns or behaviors in API requests and other
  cluster activities. This enhances security by allowing administrators to quickly
  identify and respond to potential threats, ensuring that only legitimate and compliant
  actions are executed within the cluster.
rationale: Without anomaly detection in Kubernetes admission controllers, there is
  an increased risk of unauthorized or malicious changes being applied to the cluster,
  which can lead to data breaches or service disruptions. Anomaly detection helps
  in identifying and preventing suspicious activities, such as unusual API requests
  or configuration changes, which are common in attack scenarios.
