service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Image Scan On Admission
title: Enforce Image Vulnerability Scanning on Pod Admission
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes admission controller is configured
  to enforce image vulnerability scanning before allowing the deployment of pods.
  A properly configured admission controller will use tools like Clair or Trivy to
  scan container images for known vulnerabilities, ensuring that only secure images
  are deployed. This reduces the attack surface by preventing the deployment of images
  with critical vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of
  the cluster.
rationale: Without image scanning on admission, vulnerabilities present in container
  images can be deployed into the cluster, leading to potential exploitation by attackers.
  This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of the entire
  cluster. Image scanning helps detect known vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
