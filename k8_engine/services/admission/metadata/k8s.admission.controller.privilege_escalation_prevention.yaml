resource: controller
requirement: Privilege Escalation Prevention
title: Prevent Privilege Escalation in Admission Controllers
description: This control checks whether the Kubernetes admission controllers are
  configured to prevent privilege escalation by disallowing containers from running
  with escalated privileges. A properly configured admission controller should reject
  any pod or container definitions that request privilege escalation. This ensures
  that even if a container is compromised, it cannot gain additional permissions that
  could be used to exploit other services or the underlying node.
rationale: If privilege escalation is not prevented, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities
  in workloads to gain elevated permissions, allowing them to access sensitive data
  or compromise critical components of the Kubernetes cluster. This misconfiguration
  could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and lateral movement within the
  cluster.
