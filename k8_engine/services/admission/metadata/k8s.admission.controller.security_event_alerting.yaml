service: admission
resource: controller
requirement: Security Event Alerting
title: Enable Security Event Alerting for Admission Controllers
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes admission controllers are configured
  to generate alerts for significant security events. It ensures that all modifications
  to cluster configurations are monitored and alerts are triggered for suspicious
  activities. A properly configured alerting system allows for real-time detection
  and response to potential security incidents, thereby mitigating risks such as unauthorized
  access and data tampering. Good configuration includes integration with centralized
  logging and monitoring tools that are capable of ingesting and analyzing admission
  controller logs for suspicious activities.
rationale: Without proper security event alerting on admission controllers, unauthorized
  modifications to Kubernetes cluster configurations can go undetected, increasing
  the risk of privilege escalation and data breaches. Attack vectors include malicious
  actors exploiting vulnerabilities to bypass security policies or inject harmful
  configurations.
