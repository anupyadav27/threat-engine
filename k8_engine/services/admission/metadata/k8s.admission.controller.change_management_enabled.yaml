requirement: Change Management Enabled
title: Ensure Custom Admission Control Webhooks for Change Management
description: This rule verifies that custom admission control webhooks are configured
  to enforce change management policies within the Kubernetes cluster. It checks for
  the presence and proper configuration of admission webhooks that validate or mutate
  resources during creation or update. A well-configured admission controller helps
  ensure that only compliant changes are applied to resources, reducing risks of misconfiguration,
  privilege escalation, and unauthorized access.
rationale: Without proper change management enforcement via admission controllers,
  unauthorized or inadvertent changes can occur in the cluster, leading to potential
  security breaches. Attackers may exploit misconfigured resources or inject malicious
  configurations if changes aren't validated against security policies.
