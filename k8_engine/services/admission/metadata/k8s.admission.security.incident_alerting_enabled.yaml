resource: security
requirement: Incident Alerting Enabled
title: Enable Incident Alerting in Admission Controllers
description: This control checks that incident alerting is enabled for Kubernetes
  admission controllers. A properly configured alerting system ensures that security
  events such as unauthorized access attempts or policy breaches trigger alerts, allowing
  for timely response and remediation. This configuration should follow security best
  practices such as integrating with centralized logging and monitoring solutions
  to enhance visibility and compliance with industry standards like the CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmark.
rationale: Without incident alerting properly configured in Kubernetes admission controllers,
  unauthorized access attempts or policy violations could go unnoticed, leading to
  potential security breaches. An attacker could exploit this lack of monitoring to
  gain persistent access or escalate privileges within the cluster.
