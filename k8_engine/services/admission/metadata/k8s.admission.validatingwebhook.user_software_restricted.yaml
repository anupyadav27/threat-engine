service: admission
resource: validatingwebhook
requirement: User Software Restricted
title: Restrict Unauthorized Software via ValidatingWebhook
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
  is set up to restrict user software that does not meet security policies. A properly
  configured webhook will validate incoming requests against predefined rules, rejecting
  those that attempt to deploy unsafe or unauthorized software. This ensures only
  vetted software is admitted, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities and
  ensuring compliance with security guidelines such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If user-provided software is not restricted by validating webhooks, there
  is a risk of deploying unverified or malicious software into the Kubernetes cluster.
  This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of cluster integrity
  due to the execution of harmful operations or escalation of privileges.
