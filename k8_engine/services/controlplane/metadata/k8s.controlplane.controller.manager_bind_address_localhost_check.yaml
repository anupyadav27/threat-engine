resource: controller
requirement: Manager Bind Address Localhost Check
title: Bind Controller Manager to Localhost for Enhanced Security
description: This check ensures that the Kubernetes Controller Manager is configured
  to bind only to the localhost interface. By doing so, it restricts access to the
  controller manager to the local machine, preventing remote exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  A correctly configured bind address enhances security by ensuring that only trusted,
  local system processes can interact with the Controller Manager, thereby complying
  with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Binding the Kubernetes Controller Manager to localhost reduces the attack
  surface by limiting remote access to this critical component. If improperly configured,
  an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the control plane, potentially leading
  to cluster compromise, data exposure, or disruption of workloads.
