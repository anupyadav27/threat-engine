resource: server
requirement: Audit Log Maxage Check
title: Ensure Audit Log MaxAge is Properly Configured
description: This control checks that the 'maxAge' parameter for Kubernetes audit
  logs is configured to retain log entries for an appropriate duration, typically
  in line with organizational policies or regulatory requirements. A correctly configured
  'maxAge' ensures that audit logs are available for a sufficient period to facilitate
  thorough investigation and compliance audits. Proper configuration helps in tracking
  and identifying unauthorized access attempts, thereby enhancing the overall security
  posture of the Kubernetes cluster.
rationale: Improper configuration of audit log retention can lead to insufficient
  logging data for forensic analysis in the event of a security incident. Attackers
  could exploit this by erasing traces of unauthorized access or other malicious activities
  if logs are not retained long enough for detection. Maintaining an adequate log
  retention period is crucial for compliance with security policies and regulatory
  requirements.
