resource: controller
requirement: Manager Service Account Private Key File Check
title: Ensure Secure Configuration of Controller Manager Service Account Key File
description: This check verifies that the Kubernetes controller manager's service
  account private key file is securely configured. A good configuration ensures that
  file permissions are restricted to the necessary users and processes, preventing
  unauthorized access. Specifically, the file should be readable only by the controller
  manager process, ensuring that attackers cannot leverage these keys to impersonate
  system components or escalate privileges. This aligns with best practices and compliance
  standards, reducing the risk of credential compromise.
rationale: If the service account private key file for the Kubernetes controller manager
  is improperly configured, it could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive service
  account credentials. These credentials can be used by attackers to impersonate system
  components, allowing them to escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or disrupt
  operations. Ensuring the file is properly secured mitigates these risks.
