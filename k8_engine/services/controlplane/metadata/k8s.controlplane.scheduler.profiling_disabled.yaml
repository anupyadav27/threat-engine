requirement: Profiling Disabled
title: Disable Profiling on Kubernetes Scheduler
description: This check ensures that the profiling feature on the Kubernetes scheduler
  is disabled. Profiling is a tool primarily used for debugging and performance tuning,
  which, if inadvertently left enabled in a production environment, can expose internal
  metrics and system details. By validating that profiling is disabled, this control
  helps in minimizing the attack surface and reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  to sensitive information. A secure configuration is achieved by setting the '--profiling'
  flag to 'false' in the scheduler's component configuration.
rationale: Enabling profiling on the Kubernetes scheduler exposes endpoints that could
  be exploited by an attacker to gather sensitive performance data. This could lead
  to information disclosure vulnerabilities, where an attacker could gain insights
  into the system's performance characteristics and operational behavior, potentially
  aiding in further attacks or system disruptions.
