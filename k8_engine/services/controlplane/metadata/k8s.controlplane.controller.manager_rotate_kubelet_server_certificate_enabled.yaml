rule_id: k8s.controlplane.controller.manager_rotate_kubelet_server_certificate_enabled
service: controlplane
resource: controller
requirement: Manager Rotate Kubelet Server Certificate Enabled
title: Enable Kubelet Server Certificate Rotation
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes controller manager is configured
  with --rotate-kubelet-server-certificate flag set to true. This ensures that the
  kubelet server certificates are automatically rotated, enhancing security by minimizing
  the risk of certificate compromise and maintaining up-to-date encryption credentials.
  Proper certificate rotation is a key aspect of securing communication channels and
  preventing unauthorized access to the cluster.
rationale: Without enabling kubelet server certificate rotation, Kubernetes nodes
  are at risk of using stale or compromised certificates, which could be exploited
  by attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, intercepting or altering data
  communicated between nodes and the control plane. This misconfiguration increases
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
