service: controlplane
resource: controller
requirement: Manager Args Profiling Disabled
title: Disable Profiling in Controller Manager
description: This rule checks that the profiling feature is disabled in the Kubernetes
  Controller Manager by verifying that the '--profiling' argument is set to 'false'.
  Disabling profiling prevents unauthorized users from accessing detailed performance
  metrics and system data that could be used to craft attacks. Ensuring profiling
  is disabled helps in maintaining a minimal attack surface and aligns with security
  best practices, reducing the risk of information disclosure.
rationale: If profiling is enabled in the Kubernetes Controller Manager, it can expose
  sensitive system performance data which could be exploited by attackers to understand
  system behavior and identify potential vulnerabilities. This exposure could lead
  to unauthorized access or denial of service attacks, compromising the security and
  availability of the cluster.
