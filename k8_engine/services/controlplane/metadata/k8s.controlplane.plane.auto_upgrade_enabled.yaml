rule_id: k8s.controlplane.plane.auto_upgrade_enabled
service: controlplane
resource: plane
requirement: Auto Upgrade Enabled
title: Enable Auto-Upgrades for Kubernetes Control Plane
description: This control checks that auto-upgrade is enabled for the Kubernetes control
  plane, ensuring that the cluster receives the latest security patches and feature
  updates automatically. A properly configured auto-upgrade mechanism minimizes the
  window of exposure to vulnerabilities by promptly applying updates, thus maintaining
  the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the cluster. It ensures compliance
  with security best practices and reduces the risk of attacks exploiting outdated
  software.
rationale: Without auto-upgrades, the Kubernetes control plane can fall behind on
  critical security patches and updates, leaving it vulnerable to known vulnerabilities.
  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial-of-service,
  or escalate privileges within the cluster.
