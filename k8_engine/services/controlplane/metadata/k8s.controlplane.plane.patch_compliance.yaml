service: controlplane
resource: plane
requirement: Patch Compliance
title: Ensure Control Plane Nodes are Regularly Patched
description: This rule checks that all control plane nodes in a Kubernetes cluster
  are up-to-date with the latest security patches. A good configuration includes enabling
  automatic updates or implementing a regular update schedule to promptly address
  known vulnerabilities. Keeping control plane nodes patched ensures they are protected
  against exploits targeting Kubernetes components and reduces the risk of compromise.
rationale: Failure to regularly patch control plane nodes can lead to vulnerabilities
  being exploited by attackers, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, data
  breaches, and service disruptions. Unpatched systems are often targeted by attackers
  using known exploits to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code.
