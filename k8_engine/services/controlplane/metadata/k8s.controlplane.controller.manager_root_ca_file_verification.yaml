resource: controller
requirement: Manager Root Ca File Verification
title: Verify Root CA File for Controller Manager
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes Controller Manager is configured
  with a valid and trusted root CA file for communication with the Kubernetes API
  server. A correct configuration involves specifying a CA file that includes trusted
  CA certificates, ensuring that any communication with the API server is secure and
  authenticated. This setup helps prevent unauthorized entities from gaining access
  to Kubernetes infrastructure by ensuring that all communication is encrypted and
  verified against a trusted certificate authority.
rationale: A misconfigured root CA file in the Controller Manager can lead to vulnerabilities
  where malicious actors intercept or manipulate data between Kubernetes components.
  This configuration ensures that the Controller Manager uses a trusted CA, preventing
  man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server.
  Without proper verification, attackers could impersonate services or eavesdrop on
  sensitive data.
