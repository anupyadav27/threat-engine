requirement: For Workloads
title: Ensure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is Configured for Workloads
description: This rule checks that the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is configured
  for Kubernetes workloads according to security and operational best practices. Proper
  configuration of HPA ensures workloads can scale based on demand, reducing the risk
  of resource exhaustion and ensuring availability during peak loads. This involves
  verifying the correct metric targets are set, such as CPU and memory utilization,
  and ensuring that scaling policies are defined to prevent rapid scaling that could
  destabilize systems.
rationale: Without properly configured autoscaling, workloads may become vulnerable
  to denial-of-service attacks due to resource exhaustion. Misconfigured scaling can
  also lead to inefficiencies that increase costs or reduce application availability,
  making the system susceptible to failure under load or attack.
