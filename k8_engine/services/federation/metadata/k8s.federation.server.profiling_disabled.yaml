resource: server
requirement: Profiling Disabled
title: Disable Profiling on Kubernetes Federation Server
description: This control ensures that the Kubernetes Federation Server's profiling
  capabilities are disabled. Profiling is often used for performance tuning but can
  inadvertently expose detailed information about the server's operations and resource
  usage. By validating that profiling is disabled, we protect against unauthorized
  access to profiling data, thereby enhancing the overall security posture and ensuring
  compliance with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. A secure configuration involves setting
  the `--profiling=false` flag in the server's configuration.
rationale: Profiling features in Kubernetes Federation Server can expose sensitive
  information about the server's internals, which attackers could exploit to gain
  unauthorized insights or manipulate system behavior. Disabling profiling mitigates
  the risk of information leakage, reduces the attack surface, and prevents potential
  exploitation of profiling endpoints by malicious actors.
