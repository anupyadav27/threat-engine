service: federation
resource: server
requirement: Basic Auth Disabled
title: Disable Basic Authentication on Kubernetes Federation Server
description: This control checks that Basic Authentication is disabled on the Kubernetes
  federation server. A secure configuration requires using stronger authentication
  methods like token-based or certificate-based authentication, which provide better
  encryption and security. By ensuring Basic Auth is disabled, the control enhances
  the security posture by reducing the attack surface and aligning with best practices
  and compliance benchmarks such as CIS Kubernetes. This includes verifying configuration
  settings in the federation control plane to ensure no basic-auth flags are enabled.
rationale: Basic Authentication is inherently insecure as it involves sending credentials
  in plaintext. If misconfigured, attackers can intercept these credentials via man-in-the-middle
  attacks or network traffic sniffing, leading to unauthorized access to the federation
  server. Disabling Basic Auth helps prevent these attack vectors and mitigates the
  risk of credential theft.
