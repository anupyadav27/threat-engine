rule_id: k8s.federation.server.etcd_tls_certificates_configured
service: federation
resource: server
requirement: Etcd Tls Certificates Configured
title: Configure TLS Certificates for Etcd in Federation Server
description: This rule checks if TLS certificates are correctly configured for the
  etcd server used in the Kubernetes federation. Proper TLS configuration ensures
  that all communications to and from the etcd server are encrypted, thereby protecting
  data in transit. A good configuration includes using strong encryption protocols
  and regularly rotating certificates. This enhances security by safeguarding sensitive
  data against interception and ensures compliance with security standards like the
  CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: If etcd traffic is not encrypted using TLS, sensitive data such as secrets
  and configurations can be intercepted by attackers. This configuration helps prevent
  man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches
  and compromise of the Kubernetes cluster.
