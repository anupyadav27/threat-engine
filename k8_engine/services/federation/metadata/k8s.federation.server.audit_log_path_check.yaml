rule_id: k8s.federation.server.audit_log_path_check
service: federation
resource: server
requirement: Audit Log Path Check
title: Ensure Federation Server Audit Logs Have Defined Path
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes federation server's audit logging
  feature is configured with a specific and secure log file path. A correctly configured
  audit log path ensures that all operations are logged and accessible for review,
  which is crucial for detecting unauthorized access and activities. Proper audit
  logging aids in forensic investigations and compliance with security benchmarks
  such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without a properly configured audit log path, audit logs might not be generated
  or stored correctly, leading to potential loss of critical security incident data.
  Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to perform malicious activities without
  detection, compromising the system's integrity and violating compliance requirements.
