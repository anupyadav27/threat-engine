service: federation
resource: api
requirement: Server Tls Configuration Check
title: Enforce TLS for Kubernetes Federation API Server
description: This check verifies that the Kubernetes Federation API server has TLS
  configured to encrypt data in transit. It ensures that the server presents a valid
  TLS certificate and uses secure ciphers, preventing unauthorized access and data
  breaches. Proper TLS setup involves using certificates issued by a trusted Certificate
  Authority (CA) and configuring the API server to accept only secure connections.
  This enhances security by ensuring that communications between the client and server
  are encrypted, protecting against interception and tampering.
rationale: Without proper TLS configuration, data transmitted between clients and
  the Kubernetes Federation API server can be intercepted or tampered with by malicious
  actors. This exposes sensitive information and increases the risk of man-in-the-middle
  attacks, where attackers can eavesdrop or modify communications. Ensuring TLS is
  enforced protects data integrity and confidentiality, meeting compliance requirements
  and safeguarding against unauthorized access.
