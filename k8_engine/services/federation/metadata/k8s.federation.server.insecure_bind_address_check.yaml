service: federation
resource: server
requirement: Insecure Bind Address Check
title: Secure Federation Server Bind Address
description: This control checks that the Kubernetes federation server does not use
  an insecure bind address, such as 0.0.0.0, which exposes the service to all network
  interfaces. A secure configuration binds the server to a specific, trusted network
  interface, minimizing exposure to hostile networks. Proper configuration ensures
  that only authorized networks can access the federation server, reducing the attack
  surface and aligning with best practices for securing Kubernetes environments.
rationale: If the federation server is configured with an insecure bind address, it
  may expose sensitive API endpoints to unauthorized networks, increasing the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Attackers could exploit misconfigured
  network settings to intercept or manipulate federation traffic, compromising the
  integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the federated clusters.
