resource: secret
requirement: Unused Secrets Cleaned Enabled
title: Ensure Removal of Unused Kubernetes Secrets
description: This rule checks for the presence of unused secrets within a Kubernetes
  cluster and ensures they are removed in a timely manner. A proper cleanup strategy
  involves routinely identifying secrets that are no longer associated with any running
  pods or services and deleting them to minimize the attack surface. This helps prevent
  attackers from exploiting stale secrets and enhances overall cluster security by
  maintaining only necessary sensitive information.
rationale: Failure to clean up unused Kubernetes secrets can lead to unnecessary exposure
  of sensitive data. Unused secrets may become a target for attackers who exploit
  misconfigured access controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data
  breaches.
