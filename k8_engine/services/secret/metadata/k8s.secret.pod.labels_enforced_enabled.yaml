requirement: Labels Enforced Enabled
title: Enforce Labeling on Secret-Handling Pods
description: This rule checks if all pods managing Kubernetes Secrets have mandatory
  labels applied. Enforced labeling ensures that these pods are consistently categorized
  and managed according to security policies. Proper labeling enhances visibility,
  facilitates effective monitoring and auditing, and helps in implementing fine-grained
  access controls. It ensures compliance with best practices outlined in security
  benchmarks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
rationale: Without enforced labeling on pods handling secrets, security teams cannot
  efficiently track and manage access, leading to unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Attackers can exploit misconfigured or unlabeled pods to gain access
  to sensitive information, bypass auditing, and escalate privileges.
