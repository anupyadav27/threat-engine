service: secret
resource: secret
requirement: Tls Certificates Expiration Configured
title: Ensure TLS Certificates in Kubernetes Secrets Have Expiration Dates
description: This rule checks that all TLS certificates stored within Kubernetes Secrets
  have properly configured expiration dates. A valid configuration requires that each
  TLS certificate includes a specific expiration date, ensuring that the certificate
  is periodically reviewed and renewed. By enforcing expiration dates, Kubernetes
  clusters can mitigate risks associated with outdated cryptographic credentials,
  thereby reducing the potential for data breaches and ensuring compliance with security
  standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: TLS certificates without expiration dates can lead to the use of outdated
  and potentially compromised encryption, making it easier for attackers to perform
  man-in-the-middle attacks or decrypt sensitive data. Expiration dates ensure that
  certificates are regularly updated, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of data in transit and protecting against unauthorized access.
