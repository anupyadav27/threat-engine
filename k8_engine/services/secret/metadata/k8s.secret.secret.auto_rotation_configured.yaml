rule_id: k8s.secret.secret.auto_rotation_configured
service: secret
resource: secret
requirement: Auto Rotation Configured
title: Enable Automated Secret Rotation for Enhanced Security
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes secrets have automated rotation configured,
  ensuring they are regularly updated. Proper configuration involves setting up mechanisms
  like external secret management tools that support automatic rotation and integration
  with Kubernetes, such as Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Automated rotation minimizes
  the risk of using outdated credentials and helps prevent unauthorized access by
  ensuring secrets are periodically regenerated and replaced in applications.
rationale: Without automated secret rotation, secrets may become stale and vulnerable
  to leaks or unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit long-lived secrets to gain
  persistent access to sensitive resources. Regular rotation ensures secrets are refreshed,
  reducing the attack surface and mitigating the risk of credential compromise.
