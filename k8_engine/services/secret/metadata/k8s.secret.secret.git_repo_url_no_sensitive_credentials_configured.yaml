requirement: Git Repo Url No Sensitive Credentials Configured
title: Ensure Secrets Do Not Contain Git Repository Credentials
description: This check ensures that Kubernetes Secrets do not contain sensitive Git
  repository credentials, such as personal access tokens or SSH keys, without appropriate
  controls. A good configuration involves using environment variables or secure CI/CD
  mechanisms to handle credentials dynamically, combined with RBAC to restrict access.
  This prevents unauthorized access to Git repositories and complies with security
  best practices by minimizing the risk of credential exposure.
rationale: Storing sensitive credentials such as Git repository access tokens in Kubernetes
  Secrets without implementing access controls can lead to unauthorized access. If
  attackers gain access to these credentials, they can manipulate or extract sensitive
  data from repositories, potentially injecting malicious code or exfiltrating proprietary
  information.
