requirement: Policy Configured
title: Enforce Kubernetes Secret Rotation Policies
description: This control checks whether Kubernetes clusters have a secret rotation
  policy in place, ensuring that secrets are periodically updated in line with security
  best practices. A well-configured rotation policy defines the frequency of updates
  and the mechanisms for replacing secrets, thereby reducing the window of opportunity
  for attackers to exploit long-lived secrets. Proper implementation of these policies
  aligns with compliance requirements and enhances the overall security posture by
  ensuring that only up-to-date and secure credentials are in use.
rationale: Without a secret rotation policy, sensitive data such as passwords, tokens,
  and keys can become stale and susceptible to exposure through prolonged use. Attackers
  might exploit long-lived secrets to gain unauthorized access, leading to potential
  data breaches and system compromises. Implementing a rotation policy ensures secrets
  are regularly updated, minimizing the risk of exploitation from leaked or compromised
  credentials.
