service: secret
resource: transmission
requirement: Tls Enabled
title: Enforce TLS for Kubernetes Secret Transmission
description: This rule checks that all communications involving Kubernetes secrets
  are secured with TLS encryption. Proper configuration requires that all API server
  and etcd communications are encrypted and certificates are correctly set up. Ensuring
  TLS is enabled helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity in transit, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and aligning with security best practices.
rationale: Without TLS, Kubernetes secrets transmitted over the network are vulnerable
  to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially exposing sensitive data
  such as credentials and API keys. Enabling TLS ensures that communication is encrypted,
  protecting against eavesdropping and unauthorized data access.
