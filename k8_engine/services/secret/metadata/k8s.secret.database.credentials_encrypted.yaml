service: secret
resource: database
requirement: Credentials Encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Database Credentials in Kubernetes Secrets
description: This rule checks that all database credentials stored in Kubernetes Secrets
  are encrypted using strong encryption methods before being stored in the etcd datastore.
  Proper encryption of secrets ensures that sensitive information is protected at
  rest and significantly reduces the attack surface. By implementing this control,
  organizations can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive database information
  and comply with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Encrypting database credentials stored in Kubernetes Secrets is crucial
  to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and data breaches. Without
  encryption, attackers who gain access to the etcd datastore can easily retrieve
  plaintext credentials, leading to potential compromise of database systems. This
  control mitigates risks associated with data exfiltration and helps in adhering
  to data protection regulations.
