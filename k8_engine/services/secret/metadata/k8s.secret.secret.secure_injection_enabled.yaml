requirement: Secure Injection Enabled
title: Enable Secret Injection via Environment Variables
description: This control verifies that Kubernetes secrets are injected into containers
  using environment variables in a secure manner. It checks for best practices such
  as using Kubernetes secrets instead of hardcoding sensitive information within application
  code or configuration files. Secure injection via environment variables ensures
  that secrets are not exposed unnecessarily and are only accessible to authorized
  containers, reducing the risk of data breaches and facilitating compliance with
  security standards.
rationale: Failure to securely inject secrets into containers can expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit improperly managed secrets
  to escalate privileges, access sensitive information, or compromise the Kubernetes
  cluster's integrity.
