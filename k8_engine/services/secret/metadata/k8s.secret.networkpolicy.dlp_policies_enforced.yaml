resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Dlp Policies Enforced
title: Enforce Data Loss Prevention Policies on NetworkPolicies for Secrets
description: This control checks that NetworkPolicies are configured to enforce DLP
  policies specifically for Kubernetes secrets. It ensures that only authorized applications
  can communicate with pods handling sensitive data, reducing the risk of data leakage.
  A compliant configuration involves defining NetworkPolicies that restrict ingress
  and egress traffic to only those entities that require access, thereby minimizing
  the attack surface.
rationale: Without proper Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, sensitive information
  stored in Kubernetes Secrets can be exfiltrated through network communications.
  Attackers could exploit misconfigured NetworkPolicies to access and steal confidential
  data, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such
  as GDPR or HIPAA.
