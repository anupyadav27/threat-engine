resource: minimize
requirement: Key Storage Locations
title: Limit Kubernetes Secret Storage to Secure Locations
description: This control ensures that Kubernetes secrets are only stored in secure,
  designated locations such as encrypted etcd or an external secret management solution.
  The configuration should enforce that secrets are not stored in plaintext files
  or logs. By validating secret storage, organizations can reduce the attack surface
  and enhance compliance with security frameworks, preventing unauthorized access
  and maintaining data integrity.
rationale: Storing Kubernetes secrets in multiple or insecure locations increases
  the risk of unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential compromise of sensitive
  information. Attackers may exploit misconfigured storage to access secrets, leading
  to unauthorized actions within the cluster.
