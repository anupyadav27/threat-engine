rule_id: k8s.secret.certificate.revocation_list_configured
service: secret
resource: certificate
requirement: Revocation List Configured
title: Ensure Certificate Revocation Lists are Configured for Kubernetes Secrets
description: This rule verifies that all certificates managed as Kubernetes secrets
  have an associated and up-to-date Certificate Revocation List (CRL). A correctly
  configured CRL ensures that any compromised or expired certificates are effectively
  revoked, preventing their misuse. This validation involves checking CRL distribution
  points and ensuring they are accessible and current. Proper CRL configuration helps
  maintain the confidentiality and integrity of communication within the cluster,
  supporting compliance with standards like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without a properly configured Certificate Revocation List (CRL), Kubernetes
  secrets using certificates may rely on invalid or compromised credentials, leading
  to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Attackers could exploit this
  gap to impersonate services or intercept sensitive data, undermining the cluster's
  security and integrity.
