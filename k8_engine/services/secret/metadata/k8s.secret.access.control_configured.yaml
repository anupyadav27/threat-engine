resource: access
requirement: Control Configured
title: Ensure RBAC Limits Access to Secrets
description: This rule checks that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is properly configured
  to restrict access to Kubernetes secrets only to authorized users and service accounts.
  A secure configuration involves defining roles with the least privilege necessary
  and binding them to specific users or service accounts. This prevents unauthorized
  access to sensitive data stored in secrets and helps maintain the confidentiality
  and integrity of your applications.
rationale: Improperly configured access controls for Kubernetes secrets can lead to
  unauthorized access, resulting in potential data breaches. Attackers could exploit
  weak access controls to retrieve sensitive information such as database credentials
  or API keys, which can be used to further penetrate the infrastructure.
