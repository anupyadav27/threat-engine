title: Ensure NetworkPolicy Restricts Access to Secrets
description: This control checks that NetworkPolicies are configured to explicitly
  restrict pod access to Kubernetes Secrets. A properly configured NetworkPolicy should
  limit traffic to only those pods that need access, thereby reducing the attack surface.
  By ensuring that only authorized pods can communicate with the kube-system namespace
  or any namespaces holding Secrets, it helps in minimizing the risk of data leakage
  and supports compliance with GDPR regulations.
rationale: If NetworkPolicies do not restrict access to Kubernetes Secrets, sensitive
  data can be exposed to unauthorized pods. This misconfiguration can lead to data
  breaches and non-compliance with GDPR by allowing unregulated access to personal
  data stored in Secrets. Attackers may exploit overly permissive network policies
  to intercept or manipulate sensitive information.
