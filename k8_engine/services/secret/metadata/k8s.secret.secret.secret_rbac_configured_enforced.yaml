requirement: Secret Rbac Configured Enforced
title: Enforce RBAC for Kubernetes Secrets Access
description: This control verifies that RBAC policies are correctly applied to restrict
  access to Kubernetes secrets. It ensures that only authorized users and service
  accounts have the necessary permissions to access specific secrets. A secure configuration
  involves creating roles with the least privilege necessary, and binding these roles
  to specific users or service accounts. This minimizes the attack surface and helps
  prevent data breaches by ensuring that secret data is not exposed to unauthorized
  entities.
rationale: Misconfigured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Kubernetes secrets can
  lead to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data such
  as database credentials or API keys. Without proper RBAC, any user or service account
  could potentially access, modify, or delete secrets, increasing the risk of privilege
  escalation and lateral movement within the cluster.
