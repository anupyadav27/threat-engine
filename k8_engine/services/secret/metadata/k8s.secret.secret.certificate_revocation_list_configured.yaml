rule_id: k8s.secret.secret.certificate_revocation_list_configured
service: secret
resource: secret
requirement: Certificate Revocation List Configured
title: Ensure Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is Configured for Secrets
description: This control checks that the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is properly
  configured for Kubernetes secrets. A valid CRL configuration ensures that any revoked
  certificates are recognized and rejected by the system, preventing their use in
  securing communication and data access. Proper CRL configuration helps mitigate
  risks such as unauthorized access due to the use of compromised certificates, thus
  enhancing the overall security of encryption in transit.
rationale: Without a properly configured Certificate Revocation List (CRL), Kubernetes
  cannot verify if a certificate used in secret management has been revoked. This
  opens up the risk of unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle attacks if compromised
  certificates are not invalidated promptly.
