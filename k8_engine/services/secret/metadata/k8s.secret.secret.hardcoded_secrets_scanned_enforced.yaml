requirement: Hardcoded Secrets Scanned Enforced
title: Enforce Scanning for Hardcoded Secrets in Kubernetes Secrets
description: This control checks for the presence of hardcoded secrets within Kubernetes
  Secrets objects. It ensures that there is a mechanism in place to scan these secrets
  for any hardcoded credentials or sensitive information before deployment. Proper
  configuration involves integrating secret scanning tools that automatically detect
  and alert on the presence of hardcoded secrets, thereby reducing the risk of credential
  leakage and ensuring sensitive data is not exposed in plain text.
rationale: Hardcoded secrets in Kubernetes can lead to unauthorized access if not
  properly managed. Attackers who gain access to these secrets can exploit them to
  access sensitive resources or escalate privileges. By enforcing scanning for hardcoded
  secrets, you minimize the risk of exposing credentials and sensitive data, protecting
  your cluster from potential breaches.
