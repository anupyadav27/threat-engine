resource: configmap
requirement: Sensitive Data Prohibited Enforced
title: Prevent Sensitive Data Storage in ConfigMaps
description: This control checks that ConfigMaps do not contain sensitive data by
  scanning for patterns or keywords indicative of sensitive information, such as passwords
  or API keys. A correctly configured environment will use Kubernetes Secrets for
  managing sensitive data, which provides built-in encryption at rest and more granular
  access controls. Implementing this control enhances the security posture by reducing
  the risk of sensitive data exposure and aligns with best practices for secure configuration
  management.
rationale: Storing sensitive data in ConfigMaps poses a security risk as they lack
  encryption and access controls inherent to secrets, making them susceptible to unauthorized
  access and data leakage. Attackers exploiting misconfigured ConfigMaps can gain
  access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches and potential compliance
  violations.
