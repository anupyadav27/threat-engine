requirement: Renewal Process Defined
title: Ensure Certificate Secret Renewal Processes are Defined and Automated
description: This control checks for the presence of a defined and automated renewal
  process for Kubernetes certificate secrets. A good configuration involves using
  tools such as cert-manager to automate the renewal of TLS certificates used within
  Kubernetes. By ensuring that certificate secrets are automatically renewed, we mitigate
  the risk of service downtime due to expired certificates and reduce the likelihood
  of security breaches arising from outdated cryptographic materials.
rationale: If the renewal process for certificate secrets is undefined or not automated,
  expired certificates can lead to service disruptions and security vulnerabilities,
  such as man-in-the-middle attacks or unauthorized access. An automated renewal process
  ensures certificates are updated before expiration, maintaining secure communications.
