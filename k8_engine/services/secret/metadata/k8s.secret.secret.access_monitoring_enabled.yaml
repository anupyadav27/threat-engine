resource: secret
requirement: Access Monitoring Enabled
title: Enable Audit Logging for Secret Access
description: This rule checks that audit logging is enabled for accessing Kubernetes
  secrets. Properly configured audit logs will record all access attempts to secrets,
  providing an audit trail that can be analyzed to detect unauthorized access or malicious
  activities. Ensuring audit logs are enabled helps in incident response and forensic
  analysis by providing visibility into who accessed what, when, and from where. A
  good configuration includes enabling the Kubernetes audit logging feature and properly
  setting up log storage and retention policies.
rationale: Without audit logging of secret access, unauthorized access attempts or
  data exfiltration activities remain undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches.
  Attackers can exploit this to gain access to sensitive data, move laterally within
  the cluster, or escalate privileges without leaving traceable evidence.
