resource: backup
requirement: Policy Configured
title: Enforce Backup Policies for Kubernetes Secrets
description: This rule checks that backup policies for Kubernetes secrets are configured
  according to security best practices. It ensures that secrets are regularly backed
  up in a secure manner, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access during
  backup operations. A well-configured policy includes encryption, access controls,
  and regular validation of backup integrity. This reduces the risk of data loss,
  unauthorized data access, and aids in disaster recovery processes, thereby enhancing
  the overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.
rationale: Without properly configured backup policies, sensitive data stored in Kubernetes
  secrets is at risk of loss or unauthorized access. Attackers can exploit misconfigurations
  to access sensitive information or disrupt services, potentially leading to data
  breaches or compliance violations.
