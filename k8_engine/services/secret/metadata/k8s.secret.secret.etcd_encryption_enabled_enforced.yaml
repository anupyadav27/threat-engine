requirement: Etcd Encryption Enabled Enforced
title: Enforce Etcd Encryption for Kubernetes Secrets
description: This check ensures that encryption at rest is enabled for etcd, which
  stores all cluster data, including Kubernetes secrets. A properly configured encryption
  mechanism for etcd involves setting up an encryption configuration file that specifies
  which resources should be encrypted. This is crucial for protecting the confidentiality
  and integrity of sensitive data stored within the Kubernetes cluster, mitigating
  risks of unauthorized data access, and adhering to security best practices.
rationale: Without etcd encryption, sensitive data stored as Kubernetes secrets can
  be exposed if unauthorized access to the etcd database occurs. Attackers gaining
  access to unencrypted etcd data can exploit this to retrieve sensitive information
  such as API keys, passwords, and other confidential data, leading to potential security
  breaches and data leaks.
