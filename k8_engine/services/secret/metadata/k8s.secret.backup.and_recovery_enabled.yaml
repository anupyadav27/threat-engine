requirement: And Recovery Enabled
title: Ensure Backup and Recovery of Kubernetes Secrets
description: This control checks that Kubernetes secrets have a robust backup and
  recovery process in place. A good configuration involves automated, regular backups
  of secrets stored securely and independently from the cluster. Additionally, recovery
  procedures should be tested to ensure that secrets can be quickly restored to maintain
  application availability and integrity. This helps prevent unauthorized access and
  data loss, ensuring compliance with security standards.
rationale: Without proper backup and recovery mechanisms for Kubernetes secrets, there
  is a risk of data loss and disruption in case of accidental deletion, corruption,
  or malicious activity. Attackers could exploit the absence of secret backups to
  escalate privileges or access sensitive information, compromising the entire cluster's
  security posture.
