resource: tls
requirement: Certificates Expiration Check
title: Ensure TLS Secret Certificates Have Valid Expiration Dates
description: This control checks that TLS secrets in Kubernetes have certificates
  with valid, non-expired expiration dates. It ensures that each certificate under
  Kubernetes TLS secrets is renewed before expiration, adhering to security best practices.
  Properly configured expiration dates help maintain secure encrypted communication
  channels, preventing potential data breaches and ensuring compliance with security
  standards like PCI DSS and the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Expired TLS certificates can lead to unauthorized data interception and
  man-in-the-middle attacks, as they may allow attackers to exploit expired certificates
  to impersonate services. Regularly checking and updating certificate expiration
  dates mitigates the risk of using outdated certificates that compromise data integrity
  and confidentiality.
