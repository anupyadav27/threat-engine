requirement: External Secret Operator Enabled
title: Ensure External Secrets Operator is Enabled for Secret Management
description: This control checks that the External Secrets Operator is installed and
  properly configured in the Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that secrets are managed
  using external secret management solutions, which provide robust access controls
  and auditing capabilities. A proper configuration involves verifying that the External
  Secrets Operator is deployed, configured to interact with the designated external
  secret stores, and that it has appropriate permissions to fetch and update secrets.
  This setup enhances security by minimizing the risk of secrets exposure due to Kubernetes
  API server vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
rationale: If the External Secrets Operator is not enabled, Kubernetes Secrets may
  rely solely on in-cluster storage, which is susceptible to configuration drift and
  potential unauthorized access. External Secrets Operator helps manage secrets securely
  by integrating with external secret management systems such as AWS Secrets Manager
  or HashiCorp Vault. This reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information through
  misconfigurations or unauthorized access.
