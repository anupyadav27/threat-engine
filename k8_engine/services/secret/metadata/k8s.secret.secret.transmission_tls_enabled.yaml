rule_id: k8s.secret.secret.transmission_tls_enabled
service: secret
resource: secret
requirement: Transmission Tls Enabled
title: Enable TLS for Secret Transmission
description: This rule checks that all Kubernetes secrets are transmitted over the
  network using TLS encryption. Proper configuration ensures that data in transit
  is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized interception. A secure setup requires
  that all communication channels involving Kubernetes secrets use TLS to provide
  confidentiality and integrity of data, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to
  eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
rationale: Without TLS encryption, secrets transmitted over the network are susceptible
  to interception and unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and
  exposure of sensitive information. Attackers can exploit unencrypted traffic to
  perform man-in-the-middle attacks and gain access to confidential data.
