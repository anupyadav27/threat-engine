rule_id: k8s.secret.certificate.expiration_monitoring_enabled
service: secret
resource: certificate
requirement: Expiration Monitoring Enabled
title: Enable Certificate Expiration Monitoring for Kubernetes Secrets
description: This rule checks that expiration monitoring is enabled for certificates
  stored in Kubernetes Secrets. A good configuration involves automated alerts for
  upcoming expirations and timely certificate renewal processes. By ensuring that
  all certificates are monitored for expiration, it helps prevent disruptions in service
  continuity, avoids potential security breaches due to expired certificates, and
  supports compliance with security standards such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Without expiration monitoring, expired certificates can remain in use,
  leading to potential unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle attacks. Malicious
  actors can exploit expired certificates to intercept or alter data, compromising
  confidentiality and integrity. This is crucial for maintaining trust boundaries
  and ensuring service availability.
