service: secret
resource: key
requirement: Rotation Policy Defined
title: Define and Enforce Secret Key Rotation Policies
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes secret keys have clearly defined
  rotation policies. It ensures that secret keys are rotated within a specified timeframe,
  minimizing the risk of key compromise. Proper configuration involves setting up
  automatic rotation mechanisms via tools like external secrets or custom Kubernetes
  controllers. This not only reduces the window of opportunity for attackers but also
  helps organizations meet compliance requirements and follow industry best practices.
rationale: If secret keys are not rotated regularly, they can become vulnerable to
  compromise through prolonged exposure, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
  Attackers might exploit stale keys to maintain persistent access to sensitive data
  or services, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
