rule_id: k8s.secret.networkpolicy.transfer_controls_enabled
service: secret
resource: networkpolicy
requirement: Transfer Controls Enabled
title: Enforce NetworkPolicies for Secret Transfer Control
description: This rule checks whether NetworkPolicies are implemented to control the
  transfer of Kubernetes Secrets between pods. A secure configuration ensures that
  only designated pods can access secrets, reducing the attack surface by restricting
  network communication paths. NetworkPolicies should specify ingress and egress rules
  that limit access to secrets to only those pods that require them. This helps prevent
  unauthorized access and data leakage, ensuring adherence to security best practices
  and regulatory standards.
rationale: If NetworkPolicies are not enforced, unauthorized entities may access or
  intercept sensitive data, such as Kubernetes Secrets, during network communication.
  This could lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and compliance violations.
  Attackers could exploit open network policies to perform man-in-the-middle attacks
  or exfiltrate secrets, compromising the cluster's security.
