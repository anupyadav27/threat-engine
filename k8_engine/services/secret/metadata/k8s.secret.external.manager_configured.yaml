resource: external
requirement: Manager Configured
title: Ensure External Secrets Manager is Configured Properly
description: This rule checks that an external secret manager is properly configured
  to manage Kubernetes secrets. A correct configuration ensures that secrets are securely
  stored and accessed, thereby preventing unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
  Proper configuration involves setting up access controls, ensuring encryption is
  enabled, and verifying that only authorized entities have access to the secret manager.
  This practice not only reduces security risks but also helps in adhering to compliance
  requirements such as the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
rationale: Improperly configured external secret managers can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential exfiltration of sensitive data. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations
  to gain access to credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information stored in
  secrets, leading to potential breaches or data leaks.
