description: Validates that GCP compute instance has resilience dr source min telemtry
  required no pii configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance has resilience dr source min telemtry required
  no pii properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
