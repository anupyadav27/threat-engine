description: Validates that GCP compute disk has data protection storage volume encryption
  at rest enabled configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute disk has data protection storage volume encryption
  at rest enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
