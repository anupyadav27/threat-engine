description: Validates that GCP compute route has network table vpc endpoints used
  for saas where supported configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute route has network table vpc endpoints used for saas
  where supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
