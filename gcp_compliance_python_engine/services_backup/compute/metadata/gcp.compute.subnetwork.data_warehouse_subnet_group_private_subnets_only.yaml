description: Validates that GCP compute subnetwork has data warehouse subnet group
  private subnets only configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute subnetwork has data warehouse subnet group private
  subnets only properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
