description: Validates that GCP compute disk has dr replication auth roles least privilege
  configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security
  risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards
  and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute disk has dr replication auth roles least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
