description: Validates that GCP compute instance_template has launch template root
  volume encrypted by default configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance_template has launch template root volume encrypted
  by default properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
