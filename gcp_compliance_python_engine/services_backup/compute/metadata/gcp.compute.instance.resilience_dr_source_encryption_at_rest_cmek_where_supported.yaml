description: Validates that GCP compute instance has resilience dr source encryption
  at rest cmek where supported configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance has resilience dr source encryption at rest
  cmek where supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
