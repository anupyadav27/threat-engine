description: Validates that GCP compute security_policy has network anomaly destinations
  encrypted configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute security_policy has network anomaly destinations encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
