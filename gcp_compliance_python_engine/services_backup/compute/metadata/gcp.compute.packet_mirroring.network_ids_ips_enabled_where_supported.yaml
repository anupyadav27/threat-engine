description: Validates that GCP compute packet_mirroring has network ids ips enabled
  where supported configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute packet_mirroring has network ids ips enabled where
  supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
