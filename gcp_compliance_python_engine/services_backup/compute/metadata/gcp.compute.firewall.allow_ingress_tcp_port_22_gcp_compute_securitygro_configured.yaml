description: Validates that GCP compute firewall has allow ingress tcp port 22 gcp
  compute securitygro configured configured according to security best practices.
  Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute firewall has allow ingress tcp port 22 gcp compute
  securitygro configured properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
