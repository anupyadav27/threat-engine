description: Validates that GCP compute snapshot has dr restore from encrypted backups
  only configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures GCP compute snapshot has dr restore from encrypted backups only
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
