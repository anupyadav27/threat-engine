description: Validates that GCP compute instance_template has network remediation
  roles least privilege configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance_template has network remediation roles least
  privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
