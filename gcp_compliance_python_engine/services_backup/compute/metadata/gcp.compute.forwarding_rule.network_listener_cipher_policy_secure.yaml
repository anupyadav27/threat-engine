description: Validates that GCP compute forwarding_rule has network listener cipher
  policy secure configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute forwarding_rule has network listener cipher policy
  secure properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
