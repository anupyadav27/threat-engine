description: Validates that GCP compute subnetwork has network subnet private subnets
  no igw route configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute subnetwork has network subnet private subnets no igw
  route properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
