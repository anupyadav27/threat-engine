description: Validates that GCP compute network has vpc route tables no unintended
  internet paths configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute network has vpc route tables no unintended internet
  paths properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
