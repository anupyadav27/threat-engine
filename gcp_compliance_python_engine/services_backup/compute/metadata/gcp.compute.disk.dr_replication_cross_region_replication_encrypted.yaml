description: Validates that GCP compute disk has dr replication cross region replication
  encrypted configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute disk has dr replication cross region replication encrypted
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
