description: Validates that GCP compute instance has resilience dr network private
  only configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance has resilience dr network private only properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
