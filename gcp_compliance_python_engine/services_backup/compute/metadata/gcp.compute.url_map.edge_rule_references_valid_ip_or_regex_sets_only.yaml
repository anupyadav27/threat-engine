description: Validates that GCP compute url_map has edge rule references valid ip
  or regex sets only configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute url_map has edge rule references valid ip or regex
  sets only properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
