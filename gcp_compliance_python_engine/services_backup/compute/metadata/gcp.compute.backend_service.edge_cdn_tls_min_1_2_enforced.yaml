description: Validates that GCP compute backend_service has edge cdn tls min 1 2 enforced
  configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security
  risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards
  and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute backend_service has edge cdn tls min 1 2 enforced properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
