description: Validates that GCP compute backend_service has network tg health checks
  tls where supported configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute backend_service has network tg health checks tls where
  supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
