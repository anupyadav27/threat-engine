description: Validates that GCP compute url_map has edge rule group references only
  approved managed sets w used configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute url_map has edge rule group references only approved
  managed sets w used properly configured for security compliance. This control is
  essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
