description: Validates that GCP compute snapshot has dr backup immutable or worm enabled
  where supported configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures GCP compute snapshot has dr backup immutable or worm enabled where
  supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
