description: Validates that GCP compute security_policy has edge waf ip rate limit
  rules configured where supported configured according to security best practices.
  Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute security_policy has edge waf ip rate limit rules configured
  where supported properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
