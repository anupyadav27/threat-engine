description: Validates that GCP compute instance_template has launch template instance
  profile least privilege configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance_template has launch template instance profile
  least privilege properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
