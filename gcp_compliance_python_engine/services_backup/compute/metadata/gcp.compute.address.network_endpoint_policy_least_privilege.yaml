description: Validates that GCP compute address has network endpoint policy least
  privilege configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute address has network endpoint policy least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
