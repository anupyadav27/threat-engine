description: Validates that GCP compute instance has resilience security groups restrictive
  configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security
  risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards
  and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance has resilience security groups restrictive
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
