description: Validates that GCP compute address has ip unassigned configured according
  to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents
  unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute address has ip unassigned properly configured for security
  compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture
  and meeting regulatory requirements.
