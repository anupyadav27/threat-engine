description: Validates that GCP compute vpn_tunnel has network cgw no public management
  interfaces exposed configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute vpn_tunnel has network cgw no public management interfaces
  exposed properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
