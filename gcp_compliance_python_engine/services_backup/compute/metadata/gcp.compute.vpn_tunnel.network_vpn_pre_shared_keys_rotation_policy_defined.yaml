description: Validates that GCP compute vpn_tunnel has network vpn pre shared keys
  rotation policy defined configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: secrets_and_key_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute vpn_tunnel has network vpn pre shared keys rotation
  policy defined properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
