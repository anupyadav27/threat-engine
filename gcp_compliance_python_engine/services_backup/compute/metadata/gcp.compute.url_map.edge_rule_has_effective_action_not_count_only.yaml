description: Validates that GCP compute url_map has edge rule has effective action
  not count only configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute url_map has edge rule has effective action not count
  only properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
