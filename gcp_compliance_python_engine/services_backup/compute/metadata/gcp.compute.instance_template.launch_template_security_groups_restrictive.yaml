description: Validates that GCP compute instance_template has launch template security
  groups restrictive configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance_template has launch template security groups
  restrictive properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
