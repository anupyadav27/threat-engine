description: Validates that GCP compute security_policy has network anomaly detectors
  enabled configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute security_policy has network anomaly detectors enabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
