description: Validates that GCP compute address has edge ip set used by at least one
  rule configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute address has edge ip set used by at least one rule properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
