description: Validates that GCP compute url_map has edge origin request policy forward
  querystrings minimal configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute url_map has edge origin request policy forward querystrings
  minimal properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
