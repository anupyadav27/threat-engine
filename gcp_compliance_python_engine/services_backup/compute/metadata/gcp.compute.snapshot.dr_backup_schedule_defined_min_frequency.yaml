description: Validates that GCP compute snapshot has dr backup schedule defined min
  frequency configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
rationale: Ensures GCP compute snapshot has dr backup schedule defined min frequency
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
