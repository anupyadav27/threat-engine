description: Validates that GCP compute instance_template has dr execution roles least
  privilege configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance_template has dr execution roles least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
