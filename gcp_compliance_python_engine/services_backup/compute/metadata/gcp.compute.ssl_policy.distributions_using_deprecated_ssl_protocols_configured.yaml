description: Validates that GCP compute ssl_policy has distributions using deprecated
  ssl protocols configured configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: identity_and_access_management
rationale: Ensures GCP compute ssl_policy has distributions using deprecated ssl protocols
  configured properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
