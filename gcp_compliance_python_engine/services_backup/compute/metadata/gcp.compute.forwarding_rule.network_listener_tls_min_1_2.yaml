description: Validates that GCP compute forwarding_rule has network listener tls min
  1 2 configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute forwarding_rule has network listener tls min 1 2 properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
