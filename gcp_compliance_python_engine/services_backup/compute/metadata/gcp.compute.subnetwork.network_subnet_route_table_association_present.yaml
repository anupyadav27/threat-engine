description: Validates that GCP compute subnetwork has network subnet route table
  association present configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute subnetwork has network subnet route table association
  present properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
