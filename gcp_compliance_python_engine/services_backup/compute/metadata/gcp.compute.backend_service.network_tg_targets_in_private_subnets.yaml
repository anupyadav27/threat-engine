description: Validates that GCP compute backend_service has network tg targets in
  private subnets configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute backend_service has network tg targets in private subnets
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
