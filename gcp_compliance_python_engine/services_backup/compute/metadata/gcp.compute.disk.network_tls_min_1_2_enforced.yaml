description: Validates that GCP compute disk has network tls min 1 2 enforced configured
  according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks,
  prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and
  regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures GCP compute disk has network tls min 1 2 enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
