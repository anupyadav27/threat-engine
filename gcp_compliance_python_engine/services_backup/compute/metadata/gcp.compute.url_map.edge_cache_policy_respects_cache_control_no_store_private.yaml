description: Validates that GCP compute url_map has edge cache policy respects cache
  control no store private configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute url_map has edge cache policy respects cache control
  no store private properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
