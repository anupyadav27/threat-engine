description: Validates that GCP compute instance has resilience dr source agent to
  service tls required configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance has resilience dr source agent to service
  tls required properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
