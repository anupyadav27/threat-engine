description: Validates that GCP compute instance_template has launch template imds
  hardened configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures GCP compute instance_template has launch template imds hardened
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
