description: Validates that GCP compute route has network table no 0 0 0 0 from private
  subnets configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP compute route has network table no 0 0 0 0 from private subnets
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
