description: Validates that GCP aiplatform batch_prediction_job has machine learning
  transform job private networking enforced configured according to security best
  practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access,
  and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures GCP aiplatform batch_prediction_job has machine learning transform
  job private networking enforced properly configured for security compliance. This
  control is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
