title: Ensure GCP Regions are Enabled for Resource Distribution
rationale: Enabling multiple GCP regions enhances disaster recovery capabilities and
  supports compliance with regulatory requirements for data residency. It mitigates
  the risk of service disruptions by distributing resources across different geographic
  locations, thereby increasing business continuity and resilience against regional
  failures.
description: This rule checks whether multiple regions are enabled within your GCP
  environment to ensure resource distribution and redundancy. Verify that your resources
  are not confined to a single region by navigating to the Google Cloud Console, selecting
  your project, and reviewing the list of enabled regions under the 'Compute Engine'
  settings. Remediate by enabling additional regions through the console or CLI to
  distribute critical workloads and improve fault tolerance.
