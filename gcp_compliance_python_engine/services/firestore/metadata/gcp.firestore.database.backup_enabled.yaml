title: Ensure Firestore Database Backups are Enabled
rationale: Enabling backups for Firestore databases is crucial for data resilience
  and recovery in case of accidental deletions, corruption, or security incidents.
  Without backups, organizations risk losing critical data, facing operational disruptions,
  and failing to meet compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate
  data protection and recovery capabilities.
description: This rule checks whether automated backups are enabled for your Firestore
  databases. Backups allow you to restore data to a previous state, protecting against
  data loss. To enable backups, configure the Firestore database to use Cloud Firestore
  in Datastore mode, which supports daily backups. Verify backup settings in the GCP
  Console under Firestore settings. Remediation involves enabling automated backups
  and periodically testing restore processes.
