title: Ensure Firestore Global Tables are Enabled
rationale: Enabling global tables in Firestore ensures that data is automatically
  replicated across multiple regions, improving availability and durability. This
  mitigates risks associated with regional outages and data loss, which could severely
  impact business continuity and data integrity. Additionally, it supports compliance
  with regulations requiring data resilience.
description: This check verifies whether Firestore databases have global tables enabled,
  which ensures that data is replicated across geographically distributed locations.
  To verify, review the Firestore settings in the GCP Console under the Firestore
  database section and ensure the 'multi-region' configuration is selected. If not
  enabled, reconfigure the database settings to use global tables, ensuring data is
  stored in multiple regions.
