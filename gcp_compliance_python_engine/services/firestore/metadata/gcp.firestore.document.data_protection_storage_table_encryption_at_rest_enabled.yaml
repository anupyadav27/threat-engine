service: firestore
resource: document
requirement: Data Protection Storage Table Encryption At Rest Enabled
scope: firestore.document.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Firestore Documents are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting Firestore documents at rest is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and data breaches. It mitigates risks associated with
  data theft and ensures compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and PCI-DSS, which mandate encryption to safeguard personal and financial information.
description: This rule checks if Firestore documents are encrypted at rest using Google-managed
  encryption keys. To verify, ensure that the Firestore database is configured with
  encryption settings enabled by default, utilizing Google Cloud's built-in encryption
  mechanisms. Remediation involves reviewing and enabling encryption settings via
  the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to protect stored data against unauthorized access.
