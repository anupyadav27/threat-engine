title: Ensure Firestore Databases Have Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Firestore databases protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access, ensuring that even if physical storage is compromised,
  the data remains secure. This is crucial for maintaining customer trust, meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements like GDPR and HIPAA, and mitigating risks associated
  with data breaches.
description: This rule checks if Firestore databases have encryption at rest enabled.
  Firestore automatically encrypts all data before it is written to disk and decrypts
  it when read, using Google-managed encryption keys by default. To verify, ensure
  that Firestore has encryption enabled in the GCP Console under Firestore settings.
  Remediation involves configuring custom encryption keys via Google Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS) if enhanced control is required.
