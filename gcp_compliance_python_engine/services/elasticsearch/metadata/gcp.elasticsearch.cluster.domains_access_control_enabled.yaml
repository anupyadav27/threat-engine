title: Elasticsearch Cluster Domains Access Control Enabled
rationale: Enabling domains access control on Elasticsearch clusters reduces the risk
  of unauthorized access by enforcing authentication and authorization policies. This
  is crucial in preventing data breaches and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust access controls to protect sensitive
  information.
description: This rule checks if Elasticsearch clusters have domains access control
  enabled, which ensures that only authorized users and applications can access the
  cluster. To verify, review the cluster's access control settings in the GCP console
  under Elasticsearch settings. Remediation involves configuring appropriate IAM roles
  and policies to enforce domain-specific access restrictions, thereby enhancing the
  security posture of your Elasticsearch deployment.
