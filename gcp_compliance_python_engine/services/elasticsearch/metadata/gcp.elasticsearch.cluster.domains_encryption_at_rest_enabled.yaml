title: Ensure Elasticsearch Clusters Have Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Elasticsearch clusters on GCP is critical
  to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data is
  vulnerable to physical threats and insider threats, potentially leading to data
  breaches. Compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and GDPR often mandates encryption
  at rest to safeguard personal and financial information.
description: This rule checks if encryption at rest is enabled for Elasticsearch clusters
  in Google Cloud. It ensures that all data stored within the Elasticsearch domain
  is encrypted using Google-managed encryption keys, which helps protect data integrity
  and confidentiality. To verify this setting, navigate to the Elasticsearch cluster
  settings in the GCP Console and confirm that the 'Encryption at Rest' option is
  enabled. Remediation involves enabling this option for all clusters without it currently
  active.
