title: Ensure Elasticsearch Node-to-Node Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Enabling node-to-node encryption for Elasticsearch clusters is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data traversing between nodes. Without this encryption,
  data in transit can be intercepted by unauthorized parties, leading to potential
  data breaches. This practice is often required to meet compliance with standards
  such as PCI-DSS and GDPR, which mandate robust data protection mechanisms.
description: This rule checks if the Elasticsearch cluster has node-to-node encryption
  enabled, ensuring that all data transferred between cluster nodes is encrypted.
  To verify, access the Elasticsearch cluster settings in the GCP Console and confirm
  that the 'xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled' configuration is set to 'true'.
  Remediation involves updating the Elasticsearch settings and ensuring encryption
  certificates are properly configured and managed.
