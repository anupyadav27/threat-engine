title: Enable Logging for Elasticsearch Clusters on GCP
rationale: Enabling logging for Elasticsearch clusters is crucial for tracking access
  patterns, detecting unauthorized access attempts, and ensuring data integrity. It
  supports compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS and helps in forensic analysis
  during security incidents. Without proper logging, businesses risk operational disruptions
  and data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Elasticsearch clusters in GCP have domain-level
  logging enabled. To verify, ensure that audit logs are configured for all Elasticsearch
  clusters by navigating to the Logs Viewer in the GCP Console and checking for logs
  related to Elasticsearch domains. Remediation involves enabling audit logging for
  your Elasticsearch resources, ensuring all access and configuration changes are
  logged for monitoring and analysis.
