title: Ensure Privacy Breach Detection Integrations are Authenticated
rationale: Authenticating integrations with privacy breach detection services is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and ensure compliance with privacy
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Unauthenticated or improperly configured integrations
  could lead to data leaks, reputational damage, and legal penalties by allowing unauthorized
  data access.
description: This rule verifies that all integrations with privacy breach detection
  services within Google Cloud Security Command Center are properly authenticated.
  It checks for the presence of secure authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 or
  service accounts for API access. To remediate, ensure that each integration uses
  a secure, OAuth 2.0 token-based mechanism or a service account with the least privilege
  required. Regularly audit these configurations to maintain security and compliance.
