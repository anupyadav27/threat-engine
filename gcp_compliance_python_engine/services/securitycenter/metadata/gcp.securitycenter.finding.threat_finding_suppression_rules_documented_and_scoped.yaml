title: Document and Scope Threat Finding Suppression Rules
rationale: Documenting and scoping threat finding suppression rules ensures that only
  legitimate findings are suppressed, reducing the risk of ignoring critical security
  alerts. Proper documentation aids in compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001, and supports auditability and accountability in security operations.
description: This check verifies that all threat finding suppression rules in Google
  Cloud Security Command Center are documented and scoped appropriately. It ensures
  that rules are not overly broad, which could lead to critical security findings
  being ignored. To verify, review the Security Command Center settings to ensure
  suppression rules are clearly documented with justifications and scope limitations.
  Remediate by updating the rules to include detailed documentation and by narrowing
  their scope as necessary.
