title: Configure Privacy Breach Alert Destinations in Security Command Center
rationale: Properly configuring alert destinations for privacy breaches ensures timely
  notifications, enabling rapid response to potential data leaks. This reduces the
  risk of data exposure and helps meet compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  protecting both the organization's reputation and financial standing.
description: This rule verifies that Google Cloud's Security Command Center is configured
  with alert destinations for privacy breach detections. Ensure that appropriate channels,
  such as Cloud Pub/Sub or email notifications, are set up for real-time alerts. To
  verify, check the Security Command Center settings under the 'Notifications' section.
  Remediate by configuring alert destinations to enable prompt incident response.
