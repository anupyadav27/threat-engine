title: Ensure Security Command Center is Enabled
rationale: Enabling the Security Command Center (SCC) is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into cloud resources and identifying vulnerabilities and threats in your GCP environment.
  It helps mitigate risks by providing threat intelligence and insights into potential
  security misconfigurations, which is essential for protecting sensitive data and
  maintaining compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether the Security Command Center is enabled on your
  GCP projects. SCC is a centralized security and risk management platform that aggregates
  security findings from various GCP services. To verify, navigate to the Security
  Command Center in the Google Cloud Console and ensure that it is activated for all
  relevant projects. If not enabled, follow the setup guide to activate SCC and configure
  it to suit your organization's security needs.
