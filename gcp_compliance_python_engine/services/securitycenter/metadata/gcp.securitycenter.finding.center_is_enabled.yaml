title: Ensure Security Command Center is Enabled
rationale: Enabling Security Command Center is crucial for gaining visibility into
  your Google Cloud resources and identifying potential security threats. Without
  it, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities, leading to increased risk of
  data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR or PCI-DSS.
  This can result in financial penalties and damage to company reputation.
description: This rule checks whether the Security Command Center is enabled, which
  is essential for monitoring and managing security findings across Google Cloud resources.
  To verify, navigate to the Security Command Center in the Google Cloud Console and
  ensure it is activated for your organization. If not enabled, activate it via the
  console or use the gcloud command-line tool. This will help in proactively detecting,
  analyzing, and mitigating security threats.
