title: Ensure Vulnerability Scan Results Exports Are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting vulnerability scan results exported to storage ensures that
  sensitive data about system vulnerabilities is protected against unauthorized access.
  This helps prevent data breaches, protects organizational reputation, and meets
  compliance requirements for data protection such as those outlined by NIST and ISO
  27001. It mitigates the risk of exposure of potential attack vectors to malicious
  actors.
description: This rule checks whether the destination where vulnerability scan results
  are exported is encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that the storage bucket or database where the results are
  stored has encryption enabled in its configuration settings. Remediation involves
  enabling encryption on the storage destination either by using Google Cloud's default
  encryption or by applying a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) for enhanced
  security control.
