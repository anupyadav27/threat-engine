requirement: Threat Custom Identifier Storage Encrypted
scope: securitycenter.source.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Encryption for Threat Custom Identifier Storage
rationale: Encrypting threat custom identifier storage mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive threat intelligence data, protecting against data breaches and
  ensuring privacy. This practice supports compliance with standards such as NIST
  and PCI-DSS, which require data protection measures for sensitive information.
description: This rule checks if threat custom identifier storage in Google Cloud
  Security Command Center (SCC) is encrypted at rest. It requires enabling and configuring
  encryption settings to use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for enhanced
  security. Administrators should verify that encryption is enabled for SCC sources
  and configure CMEK through the Google Cloud Console or via gcloud commands.
