title: Encrypt Threat Finding Archival Exports
rationale: Encrypting threat finding archival exports is crucial for protecting sensitive
  security data from unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations. It prevents potential attackers from
  accessing or tampering with security findings, which could lead to undetected threats
  and vulnerabilities within the cloud environment.
description: This rule checks if threat finding archival exports from Security Command
  Center are encrypted at rest using Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). To verify,
  ensure that the Cloud Storage buckets used for storing exports are configured with
  CMEK. Remediation involves setting up CMEK for the relevant storage buckets and
  updating export configurations to use these encrypted buckets. This protects exported
  security data by leveraging advanced encryption keys managed through Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS).
