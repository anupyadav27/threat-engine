subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Threat Detector Findings Export with Encryption
rationale: Encrypting threat detector findings is critical to protect sensitive data
  from unauthorized access during storage and transmission. Unencrypted exports could
  expose vulnerabilities and sensitive information to malicious actors, potentially
  leading to data breaches or non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether findings from the Threat Detector are exported
  to a destination with encryption enabled at rest. It ensures that all exported data
  is encrypted using Cloud Storage bucket-level encryption settings. To verify, confirm
  that the destination bucket has a default encryption key configured. Remediation
  involves setting a default encryption key on the Cloud Storage bucket used for exports,
  which can be done via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI.
