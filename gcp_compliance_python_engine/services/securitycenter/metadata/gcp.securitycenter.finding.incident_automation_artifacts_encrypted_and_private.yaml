requirement: Incident Automation Artifacts Encrypted And Private
scope: securitycenter.finding.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Incident Artifacts Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting and securing incident automation artifacts is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and data breaches. Unencrypted or publicly accessible artifacts
  can expose sensitive information, leading to compliance violations with regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA. This rule mitigates risks of data exposure during automated
  incident handling processes, ensuring both data integrity and privacy.
description: This rule checks that incident automation artifacts within Security Command
  Center are both encrypted at rest and not publicly accessible. Ensure that all buckets
  storing these artifacts have encryption enabled and appropriate IAM policies set
  to restrict public access. Verify encryption settings in the Google Cloud Console
  and audit IAM policies to confirm they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  Remediate by enabling default bucket encryption and reviewing IAM roles and permissions.
