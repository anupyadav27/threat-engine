title: Ensure Security Command Center is Enabled
rationale: Enabling Security Command Center is crucial for monitoring and managing
  security risks across your Google Cloud environment. It provides visibility into
  threats and vulnerabilities, helping to identify misconfigurations and security
  incidents. Without it, organizations may face increased risk of data breaches and
  non-compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS or ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if Security Command Center is activated within your
  GCP environment. To verify, navigate to the Security Command Center in the Google
  Cloud Console and ensure it is enabled for continuous monitoring. Remediation involves
  activating the service from the Console, which will allow you to leverage its threat
  intelligence and analysis capabilities to maintain a strong security posture.
