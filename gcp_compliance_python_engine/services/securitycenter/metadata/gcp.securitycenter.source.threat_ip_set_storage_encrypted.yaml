subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Threat IP Set Storage is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting threat IP set storage protects sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, which can lead to financial loss and reputational
  damage. It is crucial for meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate the protection of personal and sensitive data. Encryption helps mitigate
  risks from threat actors who may gain access to storage devices.
description: 'This rule checks that all threat IP set data stored within Security
  Command Center sources are encrypted at rest using Google-managed keys. Verify that
  encryption is enabled by reviewing the encryption settings in the Google Cloud Console
  under Security Command Center. Remediate by enabling encryption for any unencrypted
  IP sets, ensuring compliance with data protection policies. Use the ''gcloud'' command
  line tool to confirm encryption settings: `gcloud security-center sources describe
  [SOURCE_ID] --format=''value(encryptionKey)''`.'
