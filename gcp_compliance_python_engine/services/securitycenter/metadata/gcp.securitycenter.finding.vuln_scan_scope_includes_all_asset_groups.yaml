title: Vulnerability Scan Scope Covers All Asset Groups
rationale: Ensuring vulnerability scans include all asset groups is critical for identifying
  and mitigating potential security risks across your entire Google Cloud environment.
  Without comprehensive coverage, vulnerabilities in unscanned asset groups could
  lead to security breaches or compliance failures, affecting business continuity
  and data protection. This is particularly important for adhering to regulatory standards
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate comprehensive risk assessments.
description: This rule checks whether the vulnerability scanning scope in Google Cloud
  Security Command Center includes all asset groups. A complete scan ensures no asset
  group is overlooked, minimizing the risk of undetected vulnerabilities. To verify,
  ensure that Security Command Center's configuration encompasses every asset group.
  If gaps are identified, adjust the scan scope settings to include all asset groups,
  ensuring ongoing monitoring and remediation of vulnerabilities.
