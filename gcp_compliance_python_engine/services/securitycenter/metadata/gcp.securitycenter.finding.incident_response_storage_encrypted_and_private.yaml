subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Incident Response Storage is Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting and securing incident response storage in GCP protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access, mitigating risks such as data breaches and unauthorized
  data manipulation. This is critical for maintaining trust and compliance with regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection measures to safeguard personal
  and sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that storage used for incident response data is encrypted
  using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys and is configured to prevent
  public access. To ensure compliance, check that Cloud Storage buckets used for incident
  response have uniform bucket-level access enabled, encryption configured, and IAM
  policies that restrict access to authorized personnel only. Remediation involves
  configuring encryption settings in the GCP Console and reviewing IAM policies to
  ensure only authorized users have access.
