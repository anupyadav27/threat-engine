title: Ensure Incident Response Versioning & Immutability in Security Center
rationale: Enabling versioning and immutability for incident response findings in
  GCP Security Center is critical to maintain data integrity and facilitate forensic
  investigations. Without versioning, historical data could be altered or lost, impacting
  the ability to analyze incidents accurately. This practice supports regulatory requirements
  for data protection and incident handling, such as those outlined in frameworks
  like NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if versioning and immutability are enabled for findings
  within GCP Security Center. By configuring these settings, you ensure that all changes
  to incident data are tracked and that previous versions are preserved. To verify,
  navigate to the GCP Console, access Security Center settings, and confirm that versioning
  is switched on and immutability policies are configured. Remediation involves enabling
  these features in the Security Center settings and regularly reviewing configurations
  to align with best practices.
