title: Enable Security Command Center for Robust Threat Detection
rationale: Enabling Security Command Center is crucial for identifying and mitigating
  security risks in real-time, providing a centralized platform for monitoring and
  managing threats across GCP resources. This reduces potential security breaches
  and data loss, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations such
  as PCI-DSS and NIST. Effective threat detection helps organizations maintain customer
  trust and protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if the Security Command Center is enabled, which is
  essential for comprehensive security monitoring on GCP. To verify, ensure that the
  Security Command Center API is activated in your GCP project and configured to continuously
  monitor and analyze security findings. Remediation involves enabling the Security
  Command Center through the GCP Console or using the gcloud command line tool, followed
  by setting up appropriate notifications and response actions.
