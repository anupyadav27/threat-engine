title: Ensure Threat Hub Master Member Configured in Security Command Center
rationale: Configuring a master member in Google Cloud's Security Command Center (SCC)
  is crucial for centralized threat intelligence management, allowing for effective
  threat detection and response. Without proper configuration, organizations may face
  fragmented threat monitoring, increasing the risk of missed alerts and inefficient
  incident response, which can lead to regulatory non-compliance and data breaches.
description: This rule checks if the Threat Hub master member is properly configured
  within the Security Command Center (SCC). A master member acts as a central point
  for managing threat intelligence across multiple projects, enabling streamlined
  security operations. Verify configuration by accessing the SCC settings in the Google
  Cloud Console and ensuring the master member is set. Remediation involves assigning
  or configuring a master member, which can be done through the console or using gcloud
  commands.
