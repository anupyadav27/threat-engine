title: Ensure Threat IP Set Sources Are Trusted
rationale: Ensuring that only trusted IP sources are included in your threat IP set
  is crucial for minimizing false positives and enhancing the accuracy of threat detection.
  Untrusted or incorrectly configured IP sources can lead to unnecessary alerts, wasting
  resources and potentially causing critical threats to be overlooked. This practice
  supports compliance with security frameworks that require accurate and efficient
  threat monitoring.
description: This check verifies that all IP sources included in your Security Command
  Center's threat intelligence feed are from trusted origins. It involves reviewing
  the configured threat IP sets and ensuring they are only populated with sources
  vetted by your organization's security policy. Remediation involves updating threat
  IP sets to exclude any sources deemed untrusted or irrelevant, and regularly auditing
  these settings to maintain their integrity.
