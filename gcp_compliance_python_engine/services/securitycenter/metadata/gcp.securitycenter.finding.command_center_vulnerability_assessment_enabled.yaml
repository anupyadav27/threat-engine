title: Enable Command Center Vulnerability Assessment
rationale: Enabling vulnerability assessments in Security Command Center is vital
  for identifying potential security weaknesses in your GCP resources. This proactive
  approach helps prevent exploitation by attackers, assists in maintaining a strong
  security posture, and supports compliance with security frameworks like NIST and
  PCI-DSS, which require regular vulnerability assessments.
description: This rule checks if the vulnerability assessment feature in Google Cloud's
  Security Command Center is enabled. This capability scans your environment for vulnerabilities
  across various resources such as VM instances and containers, providing actionable
  insights and recommendations for remediation. To verify, ensure that Security Command
  Center is set up in your GCP environment with the premium tier that includes vulnerability
  scanning. Remediation involves enabling the vulnerability assessment feature and
  regularly reviewing the findings to mitigate identified risks.
