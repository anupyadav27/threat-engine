title: Ensure High Severity Findings Are Configured in Security Command Center
rationale: Proper configuration of high severity findings in Security Command Center
  is critical for identifying and mitigating significant security risks that could
  lead to data breaches or service disruptions. Without these configurations, organizations
  may overlook critical vulnerabilities, leading to potential non-compliance with
  regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and NIST, resulting in legal penalties and
  reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if high severity findings are configured in the Google
  Cloud Security Command Center to ensure that critical vulnerabilities are identified
  and addressed promptly. Administrators should enable and configure high severity
  findings to receive alerts on potential security threats. Verification involves
  reviewing the Security Command Center settings to ensure high severity findings
  are active and appropriately configured. Remediation includes accessing the Security
  Command Center, navigating to the 'Findings' settings, and enabling notifications
  for high severity issues.
