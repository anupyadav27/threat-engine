title: Ensure Threat Intelligence IP Sets Are Applied in Security Center
rationale: Applying threat intelligence IP sets in Google Cloud Security Center enhances
  your organization's ability to detect and respond to potential cybersecurity threats.
  This practice helps minimize risks by proactively identifying and blocking malicious
  IP addresses, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with
  security standards such as NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if threat intelligence IP sets are being utilized by
  detectors in Google Cloud Security Center. Ensuring these IP sets are applied allows
  for enhanced monitoring and alerting on suspicious activities associated with known
  malicious IP addresses. To verify, navigate to the Security Center's settings and
  confirm that threat intelligence IP sets are configured and active. Remediation
  involves enabling these IP sets under the Security Center configuration and ensuring
  they are linked to relevant detectors.
