title: Enable Cloud Security Command Center for Enhanced Monitoring
rationale: Enabling Security Command Center is crucial for centralized security management,
  helping detect and mitigate threats across your GCP environment. Without it, organizations
  may face delayed threat detection, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Proactive monitoring reduces the
  risk of financial loss and reputation damage.
description: This rule checks whether the Security Command Center is enabled in your
  GCP environment, ensuring all security findings are captured and addressed. Verify
  by navigating to the Security Command Center in the GCP Console and ensuring it
  is active. To enable, go to the Security Command Center page, select your organization,
  and activate the service. Regularly review and respond to security findings to maintain
  a robust security posture.
