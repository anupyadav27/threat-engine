title: Ensure Security Command Center is Enabled for Threat Detection
rationale: Enabling Security Command Center is crucial for identifying and mitigating
  threats across GCP environments. Without it, potential security incidents such as
  unauthorized access or data breaches may go unnoticed, leading to financial loss
  or reputational damage. It also aids in meeting compliance requirements by providing
  continuous monitoring and alerting capabilities.
description: This rule checks whether the Security Command Center is enabled for threat
  detection on GCP projects. Specifically, it verifies the activation of Security
  Health Analytics, which includes threat intelligence and anomaly detection. To remediate,
  ensure that the Security Command Center is enabled and configured correctly in the
  GCP Console. This involves setting up appropriate permissions and integrating with
  existing security workflows for effective monitoring.
