title: Ensure Least Privilege for Incident Automation Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for incident automation roles minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Over-permissive roles can
  lead to unintended actions, malicious exploitation, or data exfiltration, which
  can damage business reputation and lead to non-compliance with regulatory standards
  such as NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned for incident automation in Google
  Cloud Security Command Center are operating under the principle of least privilege.
  It verifies the permissions granted are strictly necessary for task execution. To
  remediate, audit the roles and adjust permissions to only include necessary actions,
  using predefined roles where possible, and regularly review role assignments. This
  helps reduce the attack surface and ensures compliance with security policies.
