title: Enable Audit Logging for Vulnerability Automation Changes
rationale: Enabling audit logging for vulnerability automation changes is crucial
  to ensure traceability of actions affecting the security posture. Without these
  logs, unauthorized or accidental changes may go undetected, increasing the risk
  of exposure to vulnerabilities. Furthermore, audit logs support compliance with
  regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require detailed records
  of security-related activities.
description: This rule checks if audit logging is enabled for changes made to vulnerability
  automation configurations in Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC). To verify,
  ensure that the 'Admin Activity' logs are activated for the Security Command Center,
  capturing any modifications to vulnerability settings. Remediation involves navigating
  to the 'Logging' section in the GCP Console, selecting the appropriate project,
  and enabling 'Admin Activity' logs for SCC under 'Audit Logs'.
