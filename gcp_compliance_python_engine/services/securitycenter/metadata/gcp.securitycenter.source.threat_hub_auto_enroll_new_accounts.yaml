title: Enable Auto Enrollment of New Accounts in Security Command Center
rationale: Automatically enrolling new accounts in the Google Cloud Security Command
  Center ensures continuous security monitoring and compliance from the onset. This
  reduces the risk of security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in newly added
  accounts, which can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. It aligns with
  compliance requirements by ensuring consistent security posture management across
  all accounts.
description: This rule checks whether new projects are automatically enrolled in the
  Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC). To verify, access the SCC settings in
  your GCP Console and ensure the 'Auto-enroll new projects' option is enabled. If
  not configured, modify the SCC settings to automatically include new projects, ensuring
  they are immediately subject to security scans and threat analysis. This proactive
  measure helps maintain a robust security posture across your GCP environment.
