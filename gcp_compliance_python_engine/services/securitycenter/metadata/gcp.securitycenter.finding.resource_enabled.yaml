title: Ensure Security Findings Are Enabled in Security Command Center
rationale: Enabling resource monitoring in Security Command Center helps organizations
  identify and mitigate potential security threats promptly. This capability is essential
  for maintaining a robust security posture by ensuring that all security findings
  are captured and addressed, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
description: This rule checks whether security findings are enabled within the Security
  Command Center for all relevant resources. Ensuring that findings are enabled allows
  for continuous monitoring of security events and incidents. To verify, navigate
  to the Security Command Center in the GCP Console and ensure that all necessary
  resources have findings enabled. Remediate by configuring the Security Command Center
  to monitor all critical resources and review findings regularly to address any security
  gaps.
