title: Ensure Audit Logging for Incident Automation Changes
rationale: Audit logging for incident automation changes is crucial for tracking alterations
  in security configurations, which can help detect unauthorized modifications and
  potential security breaches. This ensures accountability and supports compliance
  with regulations such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 by providing a clear audit trail
  of changes.
description: This rule checks that audit logging is enabled for changes to incident
  automation within Google Cloud Security Command Center. Audit logs should capture
  who made changes, what changes were made, and when, ensuring visibility into configuration
  alterations. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, go to 'Security Command
  Center', and ensure logging settings are configured to capture all change activities.
  Remediate by enabling logging for all incident automation changes in the Security
  Command Center settings.
