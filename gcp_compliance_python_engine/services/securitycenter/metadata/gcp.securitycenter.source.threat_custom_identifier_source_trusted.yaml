title: Ensure Trusted Sources for Custom Threat Identifiers
rationale: Having trusted sources for custom threat identifiers is crucial to prevent
  the ingestion of unreliable or malicious threat data, which could lead to false
  positives, missed threats, or even system compromise. Ensuring the integrity and
  trustworthiness of threat data sources supports compliance with security frameworks
  that mandate accurate threat detection and response mechanisms.
description: This rule checks whether the custom threat identifiers in Security Command
  Center are sourced from trusted entities. Organizations should configure their threat
  intelligence sources to ensure data integrity and reliability. Verification involves
  checking the configuration of custom threat sources in Security Command Center and
  aligning them with trusted threat intelligence providers. Remediation includes removing
  untrusted sources and adding verified and reputable ones.
