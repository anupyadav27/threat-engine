title: Ensure Vulnerability Scanners are Properly Deployed
rationale: Deploying vulnerability scanners helps identify security weaknesses early,
  reducing the risk of exploitation. Regular scanning is crucial for compliance with
  standards like PCI-DSS, which mandate proactive vulnerability management. It also
  aligns with best practices for maintaining a robust security posture by enabling
  prompt remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
description: This rule verifies the deployment of vulnerability scanning agents across
  your GCP environment. It checks for the presence of security tools such as Google
  Cloud Security Command Center's built-in scanners or third-party scanning solutions.
  Proper deployment involves ensuring these tools are authorized, regularly updated,
  and cover all applicable resources. To remediate, deploy scanners on all critical
  assets, configure regular scan schedules, and review findings promptly.
