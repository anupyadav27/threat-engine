title: Enable Security Findings in Security Command Center
rationale: Enabling security findings in Google Cloud's Security Command Center is
  crucial for maintaining visibility over potential security threats. Without enabled
  findings, organizations may miss critical alerts that could lead to breaches or
  non-compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS or ISO 27001. This not only increases
  the risk of data exposure but can also result in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether security findings are enabled within the Security
  Command Center. To verify, ensure that the Security Command Center is correctly
  configured to detect and report findings for all relevant resources. Remediation
  involves navigating to the Security Command Center settings in the GCP Console and
  enabling findings for each necessary security project. This ensures continuous monitoring
  and timely detection of security threats.
