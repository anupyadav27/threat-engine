title: Ensure Least Privilege for Incident Response Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for incident response roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive security findings, which could lead
  to data breaches or misuse of critical information. This approach is essential to
  comply with regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate
  strict access control measures to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks if the roles assigned for incident response in Security
  Command Center adhere to the principle of least privilege by ensuring only necessary
  permissions are granted. Review IAM policies to verify that roles such as 'Incident
  Responder' or 'Security Viewer' are not overprivileged. To remediate, adjust IAM
  policies to align with least privilege principles by removing unnecessary permissions
  and regularly auditing access logs for security findings.
