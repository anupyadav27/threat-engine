title: Ensure No High Severity Findings in Security Command Center
rationale: High severity findings in the Security Command Center indicate potential
  vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could lead to data breaches, unauthorized
  access, or service disruptions. Addressing these findings promptly helps maintain
  the integrity of the cloud environment, protects sensitive data, and ensures compliance
  with industry regulations and standards such as ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks for the presence of high severity findings within the
  Security Command Center. High severity findings typically indicate significant security
  issues that require immediate attention. To verify compliance, regularly review
  the findings list in the Security Command Center and prioritize remediation of high
  severity issues. Implement automated alerts and workflows to ensure timely resolution
  of these findings.
