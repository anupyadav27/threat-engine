title: Ensure Threat Detection Enabled Across All GCP Regions
rationale: Enabling threat detection in all regions is crucial to maintain comprehensive
  visibility into potential security threats and anomalies across your GCP environment.
  This helps in early identification and mitigation of risks, ensuring that no regional
  deployment is left unmonitored. It also supports compliance with various regulatory
  standards that mandate continuous monitoring and incident detection capabilities.
description: This rule checks whether threat detection is active in all available
  GCP regions for the Security Command Center. To verify and enable threat detection,
  access the Security Command Center settings in the Google Cloud Console and ensure
  that the threat detectors are configured and operating in each region where your
  resources are deployed. Enabling this feature provides continuous monitoring and
  alerting for suspicious activities, thus reinforcing your security posture.
