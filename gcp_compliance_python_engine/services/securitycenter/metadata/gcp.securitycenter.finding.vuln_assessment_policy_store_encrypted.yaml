title: Ensure Vuln Assessment Policies are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting vulnerability assessment policies at rest protects sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial
  for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of security policies, reducing
  the risk of exploitation by attackers, and ensuring compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks that all vulnerability assessment policies stored within
  Google Cloud Security Command Center are encrypted using Google-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that the policies are stored in a manner that leverages
  Cloud KMS for encryption. Remediation involves configuring the storage of these
  policies to use encryption at rest by default, which can be done by enabling Cloud
  KMS integration through the Google Cloud Console or CLI.
