title: Configure Threat Finding Alert Destinations
rationale: Configuring alert destinations for threat findings in Security Command
  Center enables timely notifications for incidents, facilitating rapid response and
  mitigation. Without proper alerting, organizations may face delayed threat detection,
  increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS
  and GDPR, which mandate timely incident response.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Security Command Center has alert destinations
  configured for threat findings. Proper configuration includes setting up Pub/Sub
  topics or email notifications to ensure that security teams are promptly informed
  about potential threats. To verify, review the Security Command Center settings
  and ensure alert policies are in place. Remediation involves configuring alerting
  mechanisms through the Google Cloud Console or API to route findings to appropriate
  destinations.
