title: Ensure Least Privilege for Vulnerability Automation Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for vulnerability automation roles reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation. Excessive permissions
  can lead to data breaches or disruptions in service if compromised. Adhering to
  least privilege aligns with compliance requirements such as NIST and PCI-DSS, ensuring
  only necessary permissions are granted.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the principle of least privilege in
  roles assigned to vulnerability automation tasks in Security Command Center. Review
  and adjust IAM roles to ensure they only include permissions essential for automation
  execution. Remediate by auditing existing roles and modifying or creating custom
  roles with minimal necessary permissions. Verification can be done via the GCP Console
  IAM & Admin section or using Google Cloud CLI commands.
