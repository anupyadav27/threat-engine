title: Ensure Least Privilege for Vulnerability Assessment Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for vulnerability assessment roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, safeguarding sensitive
  information and maintaining compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS and SOC2. Excessive
  permissions can lead to exploitation, allowing attackers to escalate privileges
  or access confidential data, resulting in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned for vulnerability assessment in
  GCP Security Command Center are configured with the minimum permissions necessary
  to perform their tasks. It involves reviewing IAM policies to ensure that no unnecessary
  permissions are granted. Remediation includes auditing current roles and permissions,
  adjusting them to align with the principle of least privilege by removing any permissions
  that are not essential for specific vulnerability assessment tasks.
