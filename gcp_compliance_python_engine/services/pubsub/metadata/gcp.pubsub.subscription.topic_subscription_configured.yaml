title: Ensure Pub/Sub Subscription Has Associated Topic
rationale: Having a topic associated with a Pub/Sub subscription is crucial for message
  delivery. Without it, the subscription cannot receive messages, potentially leading
  to loss of important data or delayed processing. This configuration is essential
  for maintaining operational integrity and adhering to compliance requirements that
  mandate reliable data processing and transmission.
description: This rule checks whether a Pub/Sub subscription is properly configured
  with an associated topic. A subscription without an associated topic cannot receive
  messages, which may result in data loss and operational inefficiencies. To verify,
  ensure each subscription has a 'topic' field specified in its configuration. Remediation
  involves configuring the 'topic' field in the subscription settings through the
  GCP Console or gcloud CLI, linking it to the required Pub/Sub topic.
