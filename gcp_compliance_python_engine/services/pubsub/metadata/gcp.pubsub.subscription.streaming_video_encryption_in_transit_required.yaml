severity: high
title: Ensure Encryption In Transit for Pub/Sub Video Streams
rationale: Encryption in transit protects streaming video data from interception and
  unauthorized access during transmission. This is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  content, maintaining user privacy, and meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR
  and CCPA. Failure to encrypt data in transit can lead to data breaches, reputational
  damage, and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks that all Pub/Sub subscriptions handling streaming video
  data have encryption in transit enabled. Verify that the subscription's client uses
  TLS 1.2 or higher to encrypt data during transmission. Remediation involves configuring
  the client library to establish secure connections and updating any existing subscriptions
  that do not use TLS. Regular audits and monitoring should ensure continuous compliance.
