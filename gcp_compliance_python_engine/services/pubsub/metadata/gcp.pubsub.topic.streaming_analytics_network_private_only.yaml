title: Ensure Pub/Sub Topics are Accessible via Private Networks Only
rationale: Restricting Pub/Sub topics to private network access minimizes exposure
  to unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead to data leakage and potential
  business disruptions. It supports compliance with data protection regulations such
  as GDPR and aligns with best practices for securing sensitive data in cloud environments.
description: This rule checks if Pub/Sub topics are configured to be accessed only
  from private networks, such as VPCs, by ensuring that the IAM policies do not allow
  public access. Verify that service accounts and users with access to these topics
  are within your organization's private network. Remediation involves updating IAM
  policies to restrict access to specific IP ranges or VPCs, and employing Private
  Google Access for secure communication.
