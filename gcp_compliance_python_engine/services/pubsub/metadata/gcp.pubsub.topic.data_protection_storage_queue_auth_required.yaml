subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Pub/Sub Topics Require Authentication
rationale: Enforcing authentication for Pub/Sub topics is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Without proper authentication, sensitive data can be exposed
  to malicious actors, leading to potential data loss, financial damage, and non-compliance
  with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that all Pub/Sub topics have authentication configured
  to ensure only authorized entities can publish or subscribe to messages. Ensure
  that the 'requireAuthentication' setting is enabled for each topic. Use IAM roles
  and policies to manage access and verify configurations through the GCP Console
  or gcloud command-line tool. To remediate, apply IAM policies that restrict access
  to required users and service accounts.
