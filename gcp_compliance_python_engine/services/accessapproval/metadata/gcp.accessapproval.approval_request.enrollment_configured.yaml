title: Ensure Access Approval Enrollment is Configured
rationale: Configuring Access Approval enrollment is critical for maintaining control
  over sensitive operations and preventing unauthorized access. This rule helps mitigate
  the risk of unauthorized changes by requiring explicit approval for sensitive actions,
  aligning with compliance standards such as SOC2 and PCI-DSS. Without proper enrollment,
  organizations risk non-compliance and potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Access Approval enrollment is configured for
  the approval_request resource in GCP. Proper configuration ensures that sensitive
  actions require explicit approvals before execution, enhancing security oversight.
  To verify, check that the Access Approval API is enabled and policies are set for
  relevant projects or folders. Remediation involves enabling the Access Approval
  API and configuring approval requests for critical operations.
