title: API Key Rotation Every 90 Days
rationale: Regular rotation of API keys reduces the risk of unauthorized access by
  minimizing the window of opportunity for credential compromise. This practice is
  crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with security standards,
  such as PCI-DSS, which mandate strict access control measures. By rotating API keys,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with leaked or exposed credentials,
  thereby enhancing overall data security.
description: This rule checks whether API keys in Google Cloud Platform are rotated
  at least every 90 days. Regular key rotation is a best practice to ensure that any
  compromised keys are quickly rendered useless. To verify compliance, review the
  creation and last rotation dates of API keys in the GCP console or through the API.
  If a key is older than 90 days, it should be regenerated and updated in all applications
  that use it. This process involves updating configurations and ensuring that old
  keys are properly revoked.
