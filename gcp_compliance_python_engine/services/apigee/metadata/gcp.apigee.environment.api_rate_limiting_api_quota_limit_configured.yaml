title: Ensure API Rate Limiting and Quota Limits in Apigee Environments
rationale: Configuring API rate limiting and quota limits in Apigee environments is
  crucial for preventing service abuse, ensuring fair usage among clients, and protecting
  backend services from overuse. Lack of such configurations can lead to resource
  exhaustion, degraded service performance, and increased operational costs, while
  also potentially violating regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for the configuration of API rate limiting and quota
  limits within Apigee environments. Properly setting these limits helps manage traffic,
  control usage, and enforce policies that safeguard the API infrastructure. To verify,
  review the Apigee environment configurations for defined rate limits and quotas.
  Remediation involves using the Apigee management interface to set appropriate rate
  and quota policies aligned with business needs and compliance standards.
