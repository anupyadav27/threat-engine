title: Ensure API Rate Limits Are Set for Apigee Environments
rationale: Unbounded API rate limits can lead to resource exhaustion, service degradation,
  and increased operational costs. By setting proper rate limits, organizations can
  mitigate the risk of denial-of-service attacks and ensure fair usage of APIs. This
  aligns with compliance frameworks that require managing system capacity and maintaining
  service availability.
description: This rule checks that API rate limiting and stage throttle overrides
  in Apigee environments are not set to unbounded values. Administrators should configure
  specific limit values to control the number of requests per second allowed for each
  API. Verify this by reviewing the Apigee environment's API proxy configurations.
  To remediate, set appropriate throttle limits in the API proxy settings to prevent
  excessive use and potential abuse.
