title: Ensure Apigee API Proxy Parameters Validation is Enabled
rationale: Enabling API parameters validation in Apigee API Proxies is crucial for
  preventing malicious inputs that could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.
  It helps mitigate security risks such as injection attacks and ensures compliance
  with data integrity and protection standards. This practice supports adherence to
  regulatory frameworks like PCI-DSS and NIST, thereby safeguarding business operations
  and client trust.
description: This check verifies that API parameters validation is enabled for Apigee
  API Proxies. Parameter validation is an essential security measure that ensures
  only expected and safe inputs are processed by the API, reducing the risk of attacks.
  To implement this, configure policies in Apigee to validate parameters, ensuring
  they conform to expected formats and values. Regularly audit and update these policies
  to adapt to evolving security threats.
