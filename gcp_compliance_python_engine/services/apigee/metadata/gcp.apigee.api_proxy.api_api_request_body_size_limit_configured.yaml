title: Ensure API Request Body Size Limit is Configured for Apigee Proxies
rationale: Configuring an API request body size limit helps prevent denial-of-service
  (DoS) attacks and resource exhaustion by limiting the size of incoming requests.
  This is crucial for maintaining system performance and reliability, especially in
  environments with high transaction volumes. Additionally, it supports compliance
  with security standards that require protections against resource abuse.
description: This rule checks if an API request body size limit is configured for
  Apigee API proxies. To verify, navigate to the Apigee console, select the relevant
  API proxy, and ensure that a 'Request Body Size Limit' policy is applied. This configuration
  prevents excessively large requests from impacting system performance. Remediation
  involves setting a maximum allowable request size, thereby mitigating potential
  DoS risks.
