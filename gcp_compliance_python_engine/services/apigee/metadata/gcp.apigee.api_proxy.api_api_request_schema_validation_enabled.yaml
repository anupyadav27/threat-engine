title: Enable API Request Schema Validation in Apigee API Proxies
rationale: Enabling schema validation for API requests in Apigee helps prevent unauthorized
  data input, reduces the risk of malicious payloads, and ensures data integrity.
  This is crucial for maintaining the security posture of applications that rely on
  Apigee for API management, especially in environments where regulatory compliance
  such as PCI-DSS or HIPAA is required.
description: This rule checks if API request schema validation is enabled for Apigee
  API proxies. Schema validation ensures incoming API requests adhere to a defined
  structure, preventing unexpected or harmful data from being processed. To verify
  and enable this setting, navigate to the Apigee Management Console, access the specific
  API proxy, and ensure that the request schema validation is configured in the proxy's
  policies. Remediation involves updating the API proxy configuration to include proper
  JSON or XML schema validation policies.
