title: Ensure API Proxies Enforce Required Security Headers
rationale: Enforcing security headers in API proxies is critical to protect against
  common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.
  Failure to enforce these headers can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches,
  impacting business operations and customer trust. Compliance with security standards
  often mandates the use of such protective measures to mitigate risks.
description: This rule checks whether API proxies in Apigee enforce necessary security
  headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options.
  Verifying this involves reviewing API proxy configurations to ensure these headers
  are included in HTTP responses. Remediation involves updating the API proxy policies
  to set these headers correctly, thereby enhancing the security posture against web-based
  attacks.
