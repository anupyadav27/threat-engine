title: Ensure API Rate Limiting is Configured for Apigee Environments
rationale: Configuring API rate limiting in Apigee environments is crucial to prevent
  abuse and ensure the availability of APIs. Without proper rate limits, an API can
  be overwhelmed by excessive requests, leading to service degradation or downtime.
  This configuration helps in meeting compliance with data protection regulations
  and preventing potential denial-of-service attacks.
description: This rule checks whether API rate limiting is configured for each API
  stage within an Apigee environment. It verifies that appropriate thresholds are
  set to control the number of requests an API can handle over a specified period.
  To verify, review the API proxy settings in the Apigee management console and ensure
  rate-limiting policies are applied. Remediation involves configuring rate limit
  policies in the Apigee Edge UI by specifying the allowed request rate and burst
  capacity.
