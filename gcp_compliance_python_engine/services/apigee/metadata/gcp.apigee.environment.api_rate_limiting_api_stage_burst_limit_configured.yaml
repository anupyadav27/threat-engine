title: Ensure API Stage Burst Limit Configured for Apigee Environments
rationale: Configuring burst limits in Apigee environments helps prevent API abuse,
  ensuring service stability and protecting against denial-of-service attacks. It
  mitigates the risk of unexpected spikes in request traffic that can deplete resources,
  leading to service disruption and potential financial losses. Proper rate limiting
  also aids in compliance with industry regulations that mandate robust security controls
  for API management.
description: This rule checks that burst limits are configured for APIs in Apigee
  environments to control the maximum number of requests allowed over a short time.
  To verify, review the API proxy configurations in the Apigee console or via Apigee
  API Management APIs, ensuring that burst limit policies are applied. To remediate,
  define and implement burst limit policies according to your organization's traffic
  management policies, using the Apigee Edge management interface or API.
