title: Enable Backups for Bigtable Instances
rationale: Enabling backups for Bigtable instances ensures data resilience and disaster
  recovery capabilities, mitigating risks of data loss due to accidental deletions,
  corruption, or regional outages. This practice supports business continuity and
  aligns with compliance requirements by preserving critical data integrity in regulated
  environments.
description: This rule checks if backups are enabled for Bigtable instances, a vital
  step in ensuring data recovery and protection against data loss. To verify, navigate
  to the Bigtable console, select your instance, and ensure that automated backups
  are configured. Remediation involves setting up a backup schedule and retention
  policy appropriate to your organizational needs, leveraging GCP's Bigtable backup
  capabilities.
