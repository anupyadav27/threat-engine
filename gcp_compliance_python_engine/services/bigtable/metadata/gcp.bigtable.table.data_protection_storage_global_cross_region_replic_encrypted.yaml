service: bigtable
resource: table
requirement: Data Protection Storage Global Cross Region Replic Encrypted
scope: bigtable.table.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Cross-Region Replicated Bigtable Data is Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting data across regions protects sensitive information from unauthorized
  access during transit and storage. Unencrypted data replication can expose your
  organization to data breaches, resulting in financial loss and compliance violations
  with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks that all Bigtable tables replicated across regions use
  encryption to safeguard data at rest. Ensure that the service account associated
  with Bigtable has the necessary permissions to encrypt data with customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK). Verify this by checking Bigtable table settings in the Google
  Cloud Console or using gcloud commands. To remediate, configure Bigtable to use
  CMEK for cross-region replication.
