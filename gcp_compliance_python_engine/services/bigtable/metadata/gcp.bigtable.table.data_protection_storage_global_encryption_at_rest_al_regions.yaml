title: Ensure Bigtable Tables Use CMEK for Encryption At Rest in All Regions
rationale: Using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for Bigtable ensures that
  your organization retains control over the encryption keys that protect data at
  rest, which is crucial for meeting stringent compliance requirements and mitigating
  risks of unauthorized data access. This setup is especially important for businesses
  with sensitive data in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare.
description: This rule verifies that all Bigtable tables across all regions are configured
  to use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) instead of default Google-managed
  keys. To check, ensure that each Bigtable instance is associated with a key from
  Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Remediation involves creating a Cloud KMS key
  and applying it to your Bigtable tables via instance settings. This helps maintain
  data integrity and confidentiality by leveraging the enhanced security controls
  of CMEK.
