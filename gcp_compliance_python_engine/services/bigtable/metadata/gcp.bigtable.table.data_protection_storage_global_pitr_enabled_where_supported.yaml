title: Ensure Bigtable Global PITR is Enabled Where Supported
rationale: Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for Bigtable provides a critical
  safeguard against data loss due to accidental deletion or corruption. This feature
  is essential in maintaining data integrity and availability, which are key to business
  continuity and compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is enabled for Google
  Cloud Bigtable tables where it is supported. To verify, ensure that the 'Enable
  PITR' option is activated in the Bigtable instance settings. If not enabled, data
  recovery to a specific point in time may not be possible, increasing the risk of
  data loss. Remediation involves accessing the Bigtable console, navigating to the
  table settings, and enabling the PITR feature.
