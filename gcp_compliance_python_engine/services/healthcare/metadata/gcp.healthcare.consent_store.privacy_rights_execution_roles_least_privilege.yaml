severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Privacy Rights Roles in Consent Store
rationale: Implementing least privilege for roles involved in executing privacy rights
  in the GCP Healthcare Consent Store minimizes unauthorized data access, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such
  as HIPAA and GDPR. This approach mitigates the potential impact of insider threats
  and limits the scope of access if credentials are compromised.
description: This rule verifies that roles with permissions to execute privacy rights
  in the Consent Store are configured with the principle of least privilege. Check
  IAM policies to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted to users and
  service accounts. Remediation involves auditing current roles, removing excessive
  permissions, and using predefined roles or creating custom roles tailored to specific
  operational needs.
