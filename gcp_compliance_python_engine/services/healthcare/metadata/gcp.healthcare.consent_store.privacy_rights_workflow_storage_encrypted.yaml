title: Ensure Consent Store Data is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting consent store data at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  healthcare information from unauthorized access, mitigating the risk of data breaches,
  and ensuring compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Failure to encrypt
  could lead to significant financial penalties, loss of reputation, and legal consequences.
description: This rule checks whether the data stored in the healthcare consent store
  is encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. To
  verify, ensure that all consent stores have encryption configured in the Google
  Cloud Console under the Healthcare API settings. Remediation involves setting up
  encryption during the creation of consent stores or updating existing stores to
  enable encryption settings.
