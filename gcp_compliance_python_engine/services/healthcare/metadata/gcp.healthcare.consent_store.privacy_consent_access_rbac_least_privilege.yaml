title: Enforce Least Privilege for Consent Store Access in GCP Healthcare
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for consent stores in GCP's Healthcare
  API is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive patient
  data, which could lead to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations like
  HIPAA. Ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary permissions reduces
  the attack surface and potential for insider threats, thereby protecting patient
  privacy and maintaining trust.
description: This rule checks whether the RBAC settings for GCP Healthcare consent
  stores adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it verifies that
  access permissions are limited to only those users and roles that require it for
  their job functions. To verify compliance, review the IAM policy bindings for the
  consent store, ensuring that roles are assigned based on necessity and aligned with
  compliance requirements. Remediate by adjusting IAM policies to restrict access
  and periodically review permissions to maintain minimal access levels.
