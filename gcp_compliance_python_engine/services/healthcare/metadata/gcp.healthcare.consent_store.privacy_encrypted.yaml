title: Ensure Healthcare Consent Stores Use Privacy Encryption
rationale: Encryption of consent stores in Google Cloud Healthcare API is critical
  to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive health data. Failure to encrypt can
  lead to data breaches, resulting in financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance
  with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Properly encrypted data at rest ensures
  that even if physical security is breached, the data remains unintelligible and
  protected.
description: This rule checks whether consent stores in GCP Healthcare API have encryption
  enabled. Specifically, it verifies that all data at rest in consent stores is encrypted
  using Google-managed encryption keys or customer-managed keys. To remediate, ensure
  that the consent store is configured to use encryption by setting up the appropriate
  encryption keys during store creation or updating existing stores to include encryption
  settings.
