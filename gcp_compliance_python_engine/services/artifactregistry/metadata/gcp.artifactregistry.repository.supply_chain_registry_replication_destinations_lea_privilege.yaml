requirement: Supply Chain Registry Replication Destinations Lea Privilege
scope: artifactregistry.repository.replication
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Limit Artifact Registry Replication Destination Privileges
rationale: Improperly configured replication destinations in the Artifact Registry
  can introduce vulnerabilities by allowing unauthorized access or replication of
  sensitive artifacts. This can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized access to
  proprietary software, and potential breaches of compliance with standards such as
  PCI-DSS and ISO 27001. Limiting privileges helps mitigate these risks by ensuring
  that only authorized destinations can replicate sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that replication destinations for Artifact Registry
  repositories are configured with the least privilege necessary to perform their
  functions. Specifically, it ensures that only designated and trusted projects or
  repositories are permitted as replication destinations. Verification involves reviewing
  IAM policies and permissions associated with the Artifact Registry repositories
  and ensuring they adhere to the principle of least privilege. Remediation includes
  updating IAM policies to restrict replication permissions to trusted destinations
  only.
