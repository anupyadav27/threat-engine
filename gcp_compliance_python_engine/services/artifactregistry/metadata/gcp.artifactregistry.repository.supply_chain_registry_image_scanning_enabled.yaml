title: Enable Image Scanning in Artifact Registry Repositories
rationale: Enabling image scanning in Artifact Registry repositories helps identify
  vulnerabilities in container images before they are deployed. This proactive measure
  mitigates the risk of deploying compromised or vulnerable software, thereby enhancing
  the security posture of your containerized applications. It also supports compliance
  with regulations that mandate vulnerability management and secure software development
  practices.
description: This rule checks whether image scanning is enabled for repositories in
  Google Cloud's Artifact Registry. Image scanning should be configured to automatically
  scan container images for known vulnerabilities, ensuring that only secure images
  are used within your environment. Verification can be done by checking the repository
  settings in the Google Cloud Console to ensure that the 'Enable Vulnerability Scanning'
  option is active. If not enabled, navigate to the Artifact Registry section, select
  the repository, and activate the image scanning feature under 'Vulnerability Scanning'.
