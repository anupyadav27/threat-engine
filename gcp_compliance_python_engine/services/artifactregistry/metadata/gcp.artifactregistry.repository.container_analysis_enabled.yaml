title: Ensure Container Analysis is Enabled for Artifact Registry Repositories
rationale: Enabling Container Analysis for repositories is crucial as it provides
  vulnerability scanning and metadata storage for container images, enhancing the
  security posture by identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities early.
  This is particularly important for maintaining the integrity and security of containerized
  applications, reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable containers into production
  environments, and aiding in compliance with security standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks if Container Analysis is enabled for repositories in
  Google Artifact Registry. Container Analysis automatically scans images for vulnerabilities
  and stores metadata, ensuring that security issues are identified and addressed
  before deployment. To verify, navigate to the Artifact Registry in the GCP Console
  and check the settings for each repository to ensure Container Analysis is activated.
  If not enabled, configure the repository settings to include vulnerability scanning.
  This enhances security monitoring and helps maintain compliance with industry standards.
