title: Enforce Immutable Tags or Signing in Artifact Registry
rationale: Ensuring that tags in the Artifact Registry are immutable or that all artifacts
  are signed enhances the integrity and authenticity of software components. This
  practice mitigates risks such as unauthorized changes to artifacts, which could
  introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code, impacting business operations and compliance
  with standards like PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks that all repositories in the Artifact Registry enforce
  either immutable tags or artifact signing. Immutable tags prevent changes to existing
  tags, ensuring that once a version is published, it cannot be altered. Alternatively,
  enforcing artifact signing requires that all artifacts are cryptographically signed,
  verifying their origin and integrity. To remediate, configure the repository settings
  in the Google Cloud Console to enable either immutable tags or set up a signing
  policy, ensuring all users are aware of the new requirements.
