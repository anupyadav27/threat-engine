title: Enable Container Scanning in Artifact Registry
rationale: Enabling container scanning in GCP Artifact Registry is crucial for identifying
  vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations in container images before they are
  deployed. This proactive measure helps prevent potential breaches and data leaks,
  minimizing the risk of exposure to malware and ensuring compliance with industry
  standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether container scanning is enabled for repositories
  in Google Cloud Artifact Registry. To verify, navigate to the Artifact Registry
  in the GCP Console, select the desired repository, and ensure that the 'Enable Vulnerability
  Scanning' option is activated. Remediate by configuring the repository settings
  to automatically scan images upon upload, providing an additional security layer
  in your CI/CD pipeline.
