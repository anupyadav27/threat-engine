title: Enable Vulnerability Scanning for Artifact Registry Repositories
rationale: Enabling vulnerability scanning on Artifact Registry repositories is crucial
  for identifying and mitigating security flaws in container images and other artifacts.
  This proactive measure helps prevent the deployment of vulnerable dependencies,
  reduces the attack surface, and supports compliance with security standards such
  as NIST and PCI-DSS. Failing to scan for vulnerabilities can expose your workloads
  to potential exploits and data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether vulnerability scanning is enabled for repositories
  in Google Cloud Artifact Registry. It ensures that images and artifacts stored in
  the registry are automatically scanned for known vulnerabilities, providing detailed
  reports on potential security issues. To verify, navigate to the repository settings
  in the GCP Console and confirm that vulnerability scanning is enabled. Enable it
  by setting up a scanning configuration in the Artifact Registry settings, which
  will automatically scan all new and existing artifacts.
