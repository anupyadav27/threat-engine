title: Ensure Artifact Registry Repositories Are Private or Access Restricted
rationale: Restricting access to Artifact Registry repositories is essential to prevent
  unauthorized access and potential supply chain attacks. Publicly accessible repositories
  can expose sensitive artifacts to malicious actors, increasing the risk of data
  breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS. Limiting
  access helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of your software supply
  chain.
description: This rule checks if your Artifact Registry repositories are configured
  to be private or have restricted access to trusted identities only. To verify, ensure
  that IAM policies are applied to limit access to specific service accounts, groups,
  or users. Remediation involves updating IAM settings and network policies to restrict
  repository access to approved identities and networks. Utilize VPC Service Controls
  to further enhance security by defining a service perimeter.
