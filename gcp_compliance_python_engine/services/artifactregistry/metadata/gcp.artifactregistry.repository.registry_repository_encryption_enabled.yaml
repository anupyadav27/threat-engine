title: Ensure Artifact Registry Repositories Use Encryption at Rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Artifact Registry repositories ensures
  that sensitive data stored within the repositories is protected against unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of artifacts, especially in environments subject to regulatory requirements
  like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate strong data protection measures.
description: This rule checks whether encryption at rest is enabled for Google Cloud
  Artifact Registry repositories. Encryption at rest is a security feature that encrypts
  your data while stored on disk, preventing exposure from unauthorized access. To
  verify, ensure that each repository is configured with Google's default encryption
  or a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK). Remediation involves configuring the
  repository settings to include encryption options, either through the console or
  CLI.
