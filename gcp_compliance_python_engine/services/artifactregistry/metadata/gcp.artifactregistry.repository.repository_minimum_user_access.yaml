title: Ensure Minimal User Access to Artifact Registry Repositories
rationale: Restricting user access to GCP Artifact Registry repositories minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure, accidental deletions, or malicious modifications.
  Inadequate access controls can lead to compliance issues with standards like PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA, impacting both business reputation and financial standing.
description: This rule checks that user access to Artifact Registry repositories is
  restricted to the minimum necessary permissions. It involves auditing the IAM policies
  associated with these repositories to ensure that users only have roles that are
  essential for their tasks. To verify, review IAM policies and adjust roles to comply
  with the principle of least privilege. Remediation includes removing unnecessary
  user roles and periodically auditing access controls.
