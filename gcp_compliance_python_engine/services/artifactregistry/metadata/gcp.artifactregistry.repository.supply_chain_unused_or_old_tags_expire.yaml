title: Ensure Expiration of Unused or Old Tags in Artifact Repositories
rationale: Allowing unused or old tags to persist in artifact repositories can result
  in increased storage costs, clutter, and potential security vulnerabilities. By
  expiring these tags, organizations reduce the risk of deploying outdated or vulnerable
  artifacts and maintain a cleaner, more efficient repository. This practice supports
  compliance with best practices in supply chain security by ensuring only current
  and necessary artifacts are available for deployment.
description: This rule checks that unused or old tags within Artifact Registry repositories
  are configured to expire after a defined period. This involves setting lifecycle
  management policies to automatically remove tags that are not accessed or modified
  within a specified timeframe. Verification can be done by reviewing and configuring
  lifecycle policies in the Artifact Registry settings. Remediation includes implementing
  expiration policies that align with organizational security and operational requirements.
