title: Ensure Cross-Region Encrypted Replication for Artifact Repositories
rationale: Encrypting cross-region replicated artifacts mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  data access during transit and storage, protecting sensitive data from exposure
  and ensuring compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. It
  also reduces the impact of potential data breaches and aligns with best practices
  for securing supply chain integrity in cloud environments.
description: This rule checks that all cross-region replications of Artifact Registry
  repositories are encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed
  encryption keys (GMEK). Verify configuration by ensuring that encryption settings
  are enabled for replicated repositories. To remediate, configure the repository
  settings to use CMEK or GMEK for cross-region replication, ensuring that the encryption
  keys are properly managed and rotated according to security policies.
