title: Ensure CPU Utilization Alert is Configured in Monitoring
rationale: Monitoring CPU utilization is crucial for maintaining optimal performance
  and cost management in GCP environments. Failure to configure alerts can lead to
  undetected performance bottlenecks, resulting in downtime, financial loss, and potential
  non-compliance with industry standards that require availability and operational
  monitoring.
description: This check ensures that an alert policy for CPU utilization is configured
  in GCP Monitoring. Specifically, it verifies that there is a policy set to trigger
  alerts when CPU usage exceeds a specified threshold, indicating potential resource
  strain. To verify, review the alert policies in the Monitoring section of the GCP
  Console and ensure that a CPU utilization alert is present. Remediation involves
  creating an alert policy that specifies conditions for CPU usage and sets appropriate
  notifications.
