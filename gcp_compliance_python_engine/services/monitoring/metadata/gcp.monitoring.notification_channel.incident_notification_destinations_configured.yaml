title: Configure Incident Notification Destinations in GCP Monitoring
rationale: Having incident notification destinations configured ensures timely alerts
  for potential issues, enabling rapid response and mitigation of risks. This is crucial
  for minimizing downtime and maintaining service integrity, ultimately protecting
  business operations and data integrity. Compliance with frameworks such as ISO 27001,
  which emphasize incident management, is supported by this configuration.
description: This rule checks that incident notification destinations are properly
  configured in GCP Monitoring. It verifies whether notification channels like email,
  SMS, or webhooks are set up to receive alerts for incidents. To remediate, ensure
  that all critical incidents are mapped to appropriate notification channels in the
  Google Cloud Console under Monitoring > Alerting > Notification channels. This setup
  guarantees that alerts are managed efficiently by the relevant personnel.
