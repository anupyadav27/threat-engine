title: Enable Audit Logging for Incident Escalation Changes
rationale: Enabling audit logging for incident escalation changes in Google Cloud
  Monitoring is crucial for maintaining a reliable audit trail, which helps organizations
  detect unauthorized changes, meet compliance requirements such as SOC2 and ISO 27001,
  and improve incident response capabilities. Without proper logging, malicious or
  accidental modifications to notification channels may go unnoticed, potentially
  leading to delayed incident response and increased security risks.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for changes to notification
  channel configurations in Google Cloud Monitoring, specifically focusing on incident
  escalation settings. Administrators should verify that logging is configured to
  capture 'write' and 'admin' activity on notification channels by reviewing Cloud
  Audit Logs settings. Remediation involves enabling the appropriate log sinks and
  ensuring that audit logs are sent to a secure storage location for analysis and
  retention.
