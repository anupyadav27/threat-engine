title: Monitor VPC Changes with Alert Policies
rationale: Monitoring changes to VPCs is crucial for detecting unauthorized modifications
  that could expose sensitive data or disrupt services. Configuring alerts for VPC
  changes helps organizations quickly identify and respond to potential security incidents,
  ensuring network integrity and compliance with frameworks like NIST and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if alert policies are configured in Google Cloud Monitoring
  to track changes to Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Ensure that an alert policy exists
  which triggers notifications for actions such as creation, deletion, or modification
  of VPCs. To verify, access the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Monitoring, and
  ensure an alert policy targets 'vpc.googleapis.com' with appropriate conditions.
  Remediation involves creating or updating the alert policy to include VPC change
  detection, setting notification channels for timely responses.
