resource: group
requirement: KMS Encryption Enabled
scope: monitoring.group.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for Monitoring Groups
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for Monitoring Groups ensures that sensitive data
  is protected at rest, minimizing the risk of data breaches. This is crucial for
  maintaining data privacy and meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA,
  which mandate robust data protection measures. Without KMS encryption, unauthorized
  access to data can occur, leading to potential financial losses and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud Monitoring Groups in GCP have Key Management
  Service (KMS) encryption enabled. KMS encryption ensures that data stored within
  monitoring groups is encrypted using customer-managed keys, providing enhanced security
  control over data access. To verify, review the encryption settings for each monitoring
  group and enable KMS encryption if not already configured. This can be done through
  the GCP Console by navigating to the Monitoring Groups section and applying the
  necessary encryption settings.
