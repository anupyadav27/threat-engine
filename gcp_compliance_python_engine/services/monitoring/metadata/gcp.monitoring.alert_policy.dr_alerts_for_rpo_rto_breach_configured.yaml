title: Configure DR Alerts for RPO RTO Breach in GCP Monitoring
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) alerts for RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
  and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) breaches is critical for ensuring business continuity
  and minimizing data loss during incidents. Without these alerts, organizations may
  face extended downtimes and potential financial losses, impacting customer trust
  and compliance with regulations like ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if alert policies are configured in GCP Monitoring to
  notify administrators of DR breaches related to RPO and RTO. Ensure alert policies
  are set to trigger when specific thresholds indicating potential data loss or unacceptable
  recovery times are breached. Verify by reviewing the configurations in GCP Monitoring
  and adjusting thresholds as necessary to align with business continuity plans.
