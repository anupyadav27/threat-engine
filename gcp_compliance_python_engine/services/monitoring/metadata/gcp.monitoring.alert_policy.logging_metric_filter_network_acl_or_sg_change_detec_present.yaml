title: Monitor Network ACL & Security Group Changes via Logging Metrics
rationale: Monitoring changes to Network ACLs and Security Groups is crucial because
  unauthorized modifications can lead to potential exposure of sensitive data or unauthorized
  access to cloud resources. These changes can indicate possible security breaches
  or misconfigurations that could compromise the organization's security posture.
  Compliance frameworks like NIST and PCI-DSS require monitoring such changes to ensure
  ongoing security and integrity of cloud environments.
description: This rule checks for the presence of a logging metric filter and an associated
  alert policy that detects changes to Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) and Security
  Groups. The configuration should be set to create logs whenever changes occur and
  trigger alerts to notify administrators immediately. To verify, ensure that a logging
  metric filter is configured for these changes and that an alert policy is linked
  to notify on any log entries. Remediation involves setting up the required logging
  metric filter and alert policy using the GCP Cloud Monitoring and Logging services.
