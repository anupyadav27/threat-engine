title: Ensure Critical Alert Policies are Enabled
rationale: Enabling critical alert policies is essential to detect and respond to
  significant security incidents in a timely manner. Failure to configure these alerts
  can lead to undetected breaches, prolonged downtime, and non-compliance with regulatory
  frameworks such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate regular monitoring and alerting
  on security events.
description: This rule checks if critical alert policies are configured and enabled
  in GCP's Monitoring service. Specifically, it verifies the presence of alert policies
  that notify relevant stakeholders when critical thresholds are breached. To ensure
  compliance, configure alert policies via the Google Cloud Console under Monitoring
  by specifying conditions, notification channels, and severity levels. Regularly
  review and update these policies to align with evolving security requirements.
