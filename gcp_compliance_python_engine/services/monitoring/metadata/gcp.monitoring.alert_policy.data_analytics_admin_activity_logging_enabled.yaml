subcategory: audit_logging
severity: critical
title: Ensure Data Analytics Admin Activity Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling admin activity logging for Data Analytics services is crucial
  for maintaining an audit trail of administrative actions, which assists in detecting
  unauthorized access and supports forensic investigations in case of a security breach.
  This logging is also necessary for compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001, which require detailed records of user activities.
description: This rule checks that logging of admin activities for Data Analytics
  services is enabled in Google Cloud's Monitoring Alert Policies. To verify, ensure
  that audit logs are set to capture all admin activities in the Google Cloud Console
  under Stackdriver Logging. If not enabled, configure audit logs by navigating to
  'IAM & Admin' > 'Audit Logs' in the Cloud Console and activate the necessary log
  types for Data Analytics services. This ensures all pertinent admin actions are
  recorded and reviewed.
