title: Alert Policies Must Have Alarms Configured
rationale: Configuring alarms in alert policies is crucial to detect and respond to
  potential security incidents in a timely manner. Without proper alarms, critical
  events might go unnoticed, leading to data breaches or service disruptions. This
  practice supports compliance with standards like NIST and ISO 27001, which emphasize
  proactive monitoring and incident response capabilities.
description: This rule checks whether alarm conditions are configured for alert policies
  in Google Cloud Monitoring. An alert policy should include conditions and notification
  channels to ensure that stakeholders are informed of incidents promptly. To verify,
  review the alert policy configurations in the GCP console or use the gcloud command-line
  tool. If alarms are not configured, update the alert policies to include relevant
  conditions and notification channels, ensuring coverage for all critical metrics.
