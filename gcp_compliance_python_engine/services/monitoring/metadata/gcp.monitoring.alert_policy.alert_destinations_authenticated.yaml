service: monitoring
resource: alert_policy
requirement: Alert Destinations Authenticated
scope: monitoring.alert_policy.security
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Ensure Alert Destinations Are Authenticated
rationale: Unauthenticated alert destinations may lead to unauthorized data access
  or manipulation, posing a security risk. Authenticating alert destinations ensures
  that only verified endpoints receive monitoring alerts, which is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and meeting compliance standards like ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks that all alert destinations configured in GCP Monitoring's
  alert policies are authenticated. Ensure that destinations use secure methods such
  as OAuth 2.0 or service account keys. Verification can be done by reviewing the
  alert policy configuration in the Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud command-line
  tool. Remediation involves updating alert policies to include only authenticated
  destinations, ensuring secure communication.
