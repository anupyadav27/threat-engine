title: Ensure Capacity Alerts are Configured for GCP Monitoring
rationale: Proper configuration of capacity alerts in GCP Monitoring is crucial to
  proactively manage resource utilization and prevent service disruptions. It helps
  identify potential capacity issues before they impact business operations, reducing
  downtime and maintaining service availability. Configuring these alerts also supports
  compliance with industry standards that require monitoring of system resources.
description: This rule checks if capacity alerts are configured in GCP Monitoring
  alert policies. To verify, review the alert policies under Monitoring in the Google
  Cloud Console to ensure alerts are set for critical resources like CPU, memory,
  and storage usage. Remediation involves creating or updating alert policies to include
  thresholds for capacity metrics, ensuring notifications are promptly sent to the
  appropriate teams. This proactive approach helps maintain operational efficiency
  and continuity.
