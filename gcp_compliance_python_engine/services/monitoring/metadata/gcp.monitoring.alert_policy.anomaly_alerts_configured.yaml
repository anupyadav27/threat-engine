title: Ensure Anomaly Alerts Are Configured in GCP Monitoring
rationale: Configuring anomaly alerts in GCP Monitoring enables proactive detection
  of unusual patterns in metrics, which can indicate potential security incidents
  or system failures. This is crucial for maintaining service reliability and minimizing
  downtime, aligning with compliance requirements for timely incident detection and
  response.
description: This check verifies that anomaly alerts are configured within the GCP
  Monitoring service, which involves setting up alert policies that automatically
  trigger notifications when metrics deviate significantly from expected patterns.
  To verify, ensure that alert policies with anomaly detection conditions are active.
  Remediation involves defining anomaly detection conditions in alert policies based
  on critical metrics, such as CPU usage or network traffic, and setting up notifications
  to alert relevant teams.
