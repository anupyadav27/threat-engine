title: Ensure Alert Policies Have DR Alert Destinations Configured
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) alert destinations is essential to ensure
  that critical alerts reach key personnel during incidents, thereby minimizing downtime
  and potential data loss. Without proper alert routing, organizations risk delayed
  responses to critical events, increasing the potential for business disruptions
  and non-compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
description: This rule checks whether GCP alert policies have configured destinations
  for disaster recovery alerts, ensuring they are routed to appropriate communication
  channels like email, SMS, or webhook during incidents. To verify, inspect the alert
  policies in the Cloud Monitoring dashboard and confirm that notification channels
  are set for all critical alerts. Remediation involves configuring these channels
  via the GCP Console under Monitoring > Alerting > Edit the specific alert policy
  > Notification channels.
