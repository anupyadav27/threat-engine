title: Ensure Monitoring Group Retention Policies are Configured
rationale: Proper retention policies for monitoring groups are vital to maintain visibility
  into historical data, which aids in incident response and forensic investigations.
  Without adequate retention, organizations risk losing critical information needed
  to detect and respond to security incidents, potentially leading to compliance violations
  and financial losses.
description: This rule audits the retention settings for Google Cloud Monitoring Groups
  to ensure they align with organizational policies and compliance requirements. It
  checks the configuration to verify that logs and metrics are retained for an appropriate
  duration. Organizations should configure retention settings in the Monitoring Groups
  to meet both business needs and regulatory requirements. Remediation involves adjusting
  retention policies through the GCP Console or API to ensure data is retained according
  to specified policies.
