severity: low
title: Ensure Incident Notification Endpoints Are Authenticated
rationale: Authenticating incident notification endpoints is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive alert data, which can lead to information leakage or manipulation.
  This measure helps maintain the integrity of alerting mechanisms and ensures compliance
  with security regulations like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate secure communication
  channels.
description: This rule checks that all notification channels configured for incident
  alerts in GCP Monitoring are authenticated, which typically involves using secure
  protocols such as HTTPS. To verify, ensure that all notification channels have endpoints
  configured with authentication methods like OAuth2 or API keys. If any channel lacks
  authentication, update its configuration to include a secure authentication method
  to protect the integrity and confidentiality of alert data.
