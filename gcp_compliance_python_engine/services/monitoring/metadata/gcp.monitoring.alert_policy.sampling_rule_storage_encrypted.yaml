title: Ensure Encryption for Sampling Rule Storage in Alert Policies
rationale: Encrypting sampling rule storage in alert policies ensures that sensitive
  monitoring data is protected against unauthorized access and data breaches. This
  is crucial for maintaining confidentiality and integrity of logging information,
  reducing the risk of data exposure in case of compromised accounts or services.
  Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others often mandates encryption
  of sensitive data, making this a key aspect of regulatory adherence.
description: This rule checks that all sampling rule storage associated with GCP alert
  policies is encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) or similar mechanisms.
  To verify, inspect the configuration of alert policies in the GCP Console or via
  the gcloud CLI to ensure that encryption is enabled. Remediation involves updating
  the alert policy settings to enable encryption, leveraging CMEK when possible, to
  enhance data security and meet compliance requirements.
