title: Ensure Approved Data Sources for Anomaly Detection
rationale: Approving anomaly training data sources is crucial for maintaining the
  integrity of monitoring systems by preventing unauthorized access and data manipulation.
  This minimizes the risk of false positives or negatives in alerts, which could lead
  to overlooked threats or unnecessary operational disruptions. Compliance with industry
  standards often requires auditable and controlled environments for data processing
  and analysis.
description: This rule ensures that only approved data sources are used for training
  anomaly detection models within GCP Monitoring. Verify that data sources are listed
  in the approved sources registry and follow organizational guidelines for data access.
  Remediation involves reviewing data source configurations and updating alert policies
  to exclude unapproved sources, ensuring they align with the organization's security
  policies and compliance requirements.
