title: Ensure SSO is Enabled for GCP Monitoring Dashboards
rationale: Requiring SSO for accessing GCP Monitoring Dashboards reduces the risk
  of unauthorized access by enforcing stronger authentication mechanisms. This minimizes
  potential security breaches and helps in complying with industry regulations that
  mandate robust access controls to sensitive monitoring data.
description: This rule checks if Single Sign-On (SSO) is enforced for accessing Google
  Cloud Monitoring Dashboards. To verify, ensure that IAM permissions for dashboard
  access are configured to require authentication through a centralized identity provider.
  Remediation involves integrating with an identity provider that supports SSO and
  updating IAM policies to enforce its use. This practice enhances security by leveraging
  centralized identity management.
