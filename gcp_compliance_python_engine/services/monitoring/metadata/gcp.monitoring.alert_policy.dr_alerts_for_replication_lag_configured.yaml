title: Configure DR Alerts for Replication Lag in GCP Monitoring
rationale: Configuring alerts for replication lag ensures timely identification of
  data synchronization issues in disaster recovery (DR) scenarios, reducing potential
  data loss and service downtime. This is crucial for maintaining business continuity
  and meeting regulatory requirements related to data integrity and availability.
description: This rule verifies that Google Cloud Monitoring alert policies are configured
  to detect replication lag for disaster recovery systems. Ensure that alert conditions
  are set for key metrics associated with replication lag and that notifications are
  sent to responsible parties. To remediate, create or update alert policies in GCP
  Monitoring to include conditions for replication lag metrics, specifying appropriate
  thresholds and notification channels.
