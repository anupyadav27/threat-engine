subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Ensure DR Communication Channels in Monitoring
rationale: Configuring Disaster Recovery (DR) communication channels in GCP Monitoring
  is vital to ensure timely alerts during incidents, minimizing downtime and potential
  data loss. It helps in maintaining business continuity and meets compliance requirements
  for incident response mechanisms as per standards like ISO 27001 and NIST. Without
  proper configuration, crucial alerts may be missed, leading to delayed incident
  response and increased risk of business disruption.
description: This rule checks whether notification channels for disaster recovery
  are properly configured in the GCP Monitoring service. Verify that all necessary
  communication channels such as email, SMS, or webhook are set up to receive alerts
  for critical incidents. Remediation involves accessing the Monitoring section of
  the GCP console, navigating to Notification Channels, and ensuring that appropriate
  channels are configured and tested for functionality. This ensures that alerts reach
  the right personnel promptly during a disaster.
