title: Enable Specific Days Retention Policy for Monitoring Groups
rationale: Enabling a specific days retention policy for monitoring groups ensures
  that log data is retained according to organizational compliance requirements. This
  mitigates the risk of data loss and supports forensic investigations and auditing
  by retaining crucial monitoring information for a defined period.
description: This rule checks whether a specific days retention policy is enabled
  for Google Cloud Monitoring groups. To verify, ensure the retention policy is set
  in the group's configuration settings, specifying the number of days logs should
  be retained. Remediation involves configuring the retention policy to meet your
  organization's data retention needs using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line
  tool.
