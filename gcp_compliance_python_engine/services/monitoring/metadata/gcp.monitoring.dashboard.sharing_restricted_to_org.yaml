title: Restrict Dashboard Sharing to Organization Members
rationale: Limiting dashboard access to organization members reduces the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and potential breaches. This practice ensures that sensitive monitoring
  data is only accessible to trusted personnel, thereby protecting intellectual property
  and meeting compliance requirements with standards such as SOC2 and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if monitoring dashboards are shared only with members
  of the organization, preventing external access. Review each dashboard's sharing
  settings in Google Cloud Console to ensure access is limited to organizational emails.
  Remediation involves adjusting IAM policies to restrict access to organization members,
  using predefined roles like 'roles/viewer' or custom roles with restricted permissions.
