title: Ensure Route Table Alert Policies Are Configured
rationale: Configuring alert policies for route tables is crucial in detecting unauthorized
  or unintended changes that might affect network traffic flow, potentially leading
  to security vulnerabilities or service disruptions. It helps organizations mitigate
  risks associated with network misconfigurations and supports compliance with security
  standards that require continuous monitoring of network configuration changes.
description: This rule checks whether alert policies are configured for route table
  changes in GCP. It involves verifying that appropriate alerting mechanisms are in
  place to notify security teams when modifications to route tables occur. To ensure
  compliance, define alert policies in Google Cloud Monitoring with conditions that
  track changes to route tables and specify notification channels. Remediation involves
  setting up these alerts if they are missing, ensuring that the monitoring configuration
  aligns with organizational security policies.
