title: Ensure Memory Utilization Alert is Configured
rationale: Configuring memory utilization alerts helps prevent service disruptions
  by providing timely notifications of potential memory exhaustion. This enables proactive
  resource management, reducing the risk of application downtime and ensuring consistent
  performance. Additionally, it assists in aligning with compliance frameworks that
  mandate monitoring of critical resource metrics for operational integrity.
description: This rule checks if an alert policy is configured in GCP Monitoring to
  track memory utilization. Proper configuration involves setting thresholds that
  trigger alerts when memory usage exceeds defined limits, allowing for timely intervention.
  To verify, review your alert policies in the GCP Console under Monitoring, ensure
  thresholds are appropriately defined, and adjust as necessary to fit application
  needs. Remediation involves creating or updating alert policies to include memory
  utilization metrics with actionable thresholds.
