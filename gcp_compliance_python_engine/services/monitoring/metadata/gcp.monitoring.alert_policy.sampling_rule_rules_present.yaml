title: Ensure Sampling Rules in Alert Policies are Configured
rationale: Properly configured sampling rules in alert policies can help reduce noise
  by ensuring alerts are triggered only for significant events, which enhances operational
  efficiency and ensures critical alerts are not missed. Without sampling rules, organizations
  may face alert fatigue, leading to potential oversight of important security incidents.
  Additionally, effective alerting is essential for maintaining compliance with regulations
  that require prompt detection and response to security events.
description: This check ensures that alert policies in GCP Monitoring have sampling
  rules defined, which are necessary to filter out non-critical alerts and focus on
  events that require attention. Verify that each alert policy includes appropriately
  configured sampling rules by reviewing the alert policy configurations in the GCP
  Console or using the gcloud command-line tool. To remediate, define sampling rules
  that match your organization's security and operational thresholds, ensuring they
  align with your critical incident response requirements.
