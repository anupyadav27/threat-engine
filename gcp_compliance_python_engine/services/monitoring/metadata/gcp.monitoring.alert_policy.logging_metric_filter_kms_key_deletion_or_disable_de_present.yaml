title: Alert on KMS Key Deletion or Disablement
rationale: Monitoring for the deletion or disablement of KMS keys is critical as these
  keys protect sensitive data. Unauthorized key deletion or disablement can lead to
  data exposure, compliance violations, and operational disruptions, impacting business
  continuity and reputation. This rule helps in identifying potential security threats
  and ensures adherence to regulatory requirements like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for the existence of a logging metric filter for detecting
  KMS key deletion or disablement in Google Cloud's Monitoring service. Ensure the
  alert policy is configured to trigger an alert when a key is deleted or disabled
  to promptly respond to unauthorized activities. To verify, navigate to the Monitoring
  section in GCP Console and check alert policies for filters set on KMS key operations.
  Remediation involves creating or updating alert policies to include metric filters
  for KMS key lifecycle events.
