service: monitoring
resource: notification_channel
requirement: Incident Escalation Policy Exists For Critical Severity
scope: monitoring.notification_channel.policy_management
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Ensure Critical Severity Incidents Have Escalation Policies
rationale: Having an incident escalation policy for critical severity alerts ensures
  that potential security breaches or system failures are promptly addressed, minimizing
  downtime and potential data loss. This is critical for maintaining operational integrity
  and meeting compliance standards, as delays in response could result in significant
  business disruptions and financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that all notification channels used for monitoring
  have an associated incident escalation policy for alerts marked as critical severity.
  Without such policies, critical alerts may not be addressed in a timely manner,
  increasing risk exposure. To remediate, configure escalation policies in Google
  Cloud Monitoring by specifying notification channels and defining escalation paths
  for critical alerts. Ensure that the policies are tested and verified regularly
  to maintain effectiveness.
