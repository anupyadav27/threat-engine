requirement: DR Communication No Public Webhooks Without Auth
scope: monitoring.notification_channel.public_access
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: critical
title: Prevent Unauthenticated Public Webhook Usage in Monitoring
rationale: Allowing public webhooks without authentication in disaster recovery (DR)
  communications can expose sensitive alert data to unauthorized entities. This poses
  a risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to system alerts, potentially leading
  to non-compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, and impacting
  the organization's ability to respond to incidents effectively.
description: This rule checks if public webhooks used as notification channels in
  GCP Monitoring are configured with authentication. Ensure that all public webhooks
  require a secure authentication method, such as OAuth 2.0, to prevent unauthorized
  access. Review the configuration of each notification channel and update any public
  webhooks lacking authentication. Remediation involves modifying the webhook settings
  to enforce authentication or replacing them with secure alternatives.
