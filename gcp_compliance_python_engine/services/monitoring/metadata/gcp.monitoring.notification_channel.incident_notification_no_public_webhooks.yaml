subcategory: audit_logging
severity: critical
title: Prevent Public Webhooks for Incident Notifications
rationale: Allowing public webhooks for incident notifications can expose sensitive
  information to unauthorized parties, leading to potential data breaches or misuse
  of data. This practice can violate compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA,
  resulting in legal and financial repercussions. Ensuring notifications are sent
  to secure endpoints mitigates these risks and safeguards organizational data integrity.
description: This rule checks for the presence of public webhooks in the notification
  channels configured for incident alerts in GCP Monitoring. Public webhooks can be
  misused if exposed, thus it is imperative to use secure, authenticated channels.
  To verify, review the notification channel settings in the GCP console and ensure
  webhooks are restricted to internal or trusted endpoints. Remediation involves updating
  any public webhook configurations to secure channels, ideally leveraging OAuth or
  similar authentication mechanisms.
