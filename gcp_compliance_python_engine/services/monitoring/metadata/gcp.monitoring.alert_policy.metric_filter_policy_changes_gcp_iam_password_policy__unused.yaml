title: Monitor Unused IAM Password Policy Change Alerts
rationale: Monitoring IAM password policy changes is crucial as it helps detect unauthorized
  or unintended modifications that could weaken security controls, increasing the
  risk of unauthorized access. Regularly assessing and responding to these changes
  ensures compliance with security standards and mitigates potential insider threats
  or account compromises.
description: This rule checks for the presence and activity of alert policies that
  monitor changes to IAM password policies. If such policies are unused, it indicates
  a gap in monitoring critical configuration changes. Administrators should verify
  the existence of alert policies that trigger on password policy changes and ensure
  they are active. Remediation involves creating or enabling alert policies to monitor
  these changes and integrating them into the organization's incident response process.
