title: Ensure RBAC Least Privilege for Monitoring Alert Policies
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for alert policies minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized modifications, which could lead to missed critical alerts, data
  breaches, or system downtime. This practice supports compliance with regulations
  like GDPR and NIST by ensuring that only authorized personnel can modify alert settings
  that protect sensitive information.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to users or groups for accessing
  GCP Monitoring Alert Policies adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically,
  it verifies that users have only the necessary permissions to perform their job
  functions, such as 'roles/monitoring.alertPolicyEditor' or 'roles/monitoring.alertPolicyViewer',
  rather than overly broad roles like 'Owner'. To remediate, review and adjust IAM
  policies to ensure appropriate roles are assigned, removing any excessive permissions.
