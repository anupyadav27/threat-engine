title: Ensure Alert Policies Have Configured Alarm Actions
rationale: Configuring alarm actions for alert policies is crucial to ensure timely
  notifications and responses to incidents, minimizing potential business disruptions
  and security risks. Without proper alarm actions, critical alerts might be overlooked,
  leading to prolonged exposure to threats and non-compliance with standards that
  require incident detection and response capabilities.
description: This rule checks whether alert policies in Google Cloud Monitoring have
  appropriate alarm actions configured, which might include sending notifications
  via email, SMS, or integrating with incident management systems. To verify, examine
  each alert policy for configured notification channels or automated actions. Remediation
  involves configuring these actions in the alert policy settings through the Google
  Cloud Console or using the gcloud CLI to ensure alerts trigger predefined responses.
