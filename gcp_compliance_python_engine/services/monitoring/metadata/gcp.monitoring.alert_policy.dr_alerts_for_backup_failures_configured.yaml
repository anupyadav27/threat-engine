title: Configure Alerts for Backup Failures in GCP Monitoring
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) alerts for backup failures is crucial
  to ensure timely response to potential data loss incidents, which can lead to significant
  operational disruptions and financial losses. It helps maintain business continuity
  by enabling quick remediation of backup issues, thus safeguarding critical data
  assets. Additionally, having such alerts supports compliance with data protection
  regulations that mandate regular backup and recovery processes.
description: This rule checks if alert policies are configured in GCP Monitoring to
  notify administrators of backup failures. It requires setting up specific alert
  conditions that monitor backup operations and trigger notifications when failures
  occur. To verify, review the alert policies in the Monitoring console to ensure
  they cover all critical backup jobs. To remediate, create or update alert policies
  with conditions that detect backup failures and define notification channels for
  immediate alerting.
