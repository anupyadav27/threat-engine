rule_id: gcp.monitoring.notification_channel.dr_communication_destinations_access_least_privilege
service: monitoring
resource: notification_channel
requirement: DR Communication Destinations Access Least Privilege
scope: monitoring.notification_channel.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for DR Communication Destinations
rationale: Granting excessive permissions to disaster recovery (DR) communication
  channels can lead to data exposure or unauthorized access in the event of a breach.
  This misconfiguration increases the risk of sensitive information being leaked or
  misused, potentially violating compliance frameworks such as PCI-DSS and SOC2, and
  could result in significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that access to Notification Channels used for DR communication
  is restricted to the minimum necessary permissions. It checks IAM policies to ensure
  that only authorized users or groups have access to create, modify, or delete these
  channels. To remediate, review and update IAM policies to limit permissions to specific
  roles and service accounts that require access, following the principle of least
  privilege.
