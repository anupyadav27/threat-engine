severity: low
title: Verify Oncall Contacts for Incident Escalation
rationale: Ensuring that oncall contacts are verified for incident escalation is crucial
  for timely response to security incidents, reducing potential downtime and mitigating
  damage. This verification helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that alerts
  reach the intended personnel, supporting compliance with standards like ISO 27001
  and SOC2.
description: This rule checks that the notification channels used for incident escalation
  in GCP Monitoring have verified oncall contacts. Verification requires checking
  that contact details are accurate and the communication path is tested. To remediate,
  review the notification channel settings in the GCP Console, verify the contact
  information, and ensure that test notifications are successfully received and acknowledged
  by oncall personnel.
