severity: high
title: Ensure Encryption for Incident Notification Messages in Transit
rationale: Encrypting incident notification messages in transit is critical to protect
  sensitive data from interception and unauthorized access during transmission. Failure
  to encrypt these messages can lead to data breaches, compromising incident response
  processes and violating compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and PCI-DSS. This
  practice safeguards confidentiality and integrity, reducing the risk of exposure
  to cyber threats and ensuring trust in the monitoring system.
description: This rule checks that all incident notification messages sent via GCP
  Monitoring notification channels are encrypted in transit using TLS. Verify that
  the notification channels, such as email, SMS, or webhooks, are configured to use
  secure protocols. Remediation involves updating any non-compliant notification channels
  to enforce TLS encryption, ensuring that all data transmitted is protected against
  eavesdropping and tampering.
