title: Enable Specific Days for Group Retention in Alert Policies
rationale: Setting specific days for group retention in alert policies helps organizations
  manage data retention effectively, reducing the risk of unnecessary data exposure
  and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. By specifying retention
  periods, businesses can optimize storage costs and safeguard sensitive information
  against unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks whether specific days are set for group retention in
  GCP Monitoring alert policies. Ensuring that retention policies are configured to
  retain alert data only for the necessary period is crucial for data management and
  security. To verify, review the alert policy configurations in the GCP Console to
  confirm that the 'Group Retention Policy' specifies retention days. If not configured,
  update the policy to define a retention schedule that aligns with your organization's
  data retention standards.
