title: Ensure Alert Policies Have ACLs Alarm Configured
rationale: Configuring ACLs alarms for alert policies in GCP ensures that unauthorized
  access attempts to alter alert configurations are promptly detected. This protects
  sensitive systems from potential breaches and aids in maintaining compliance with
  security standards. Failing to monitor these changes can lead to undetected alterations
  that compromise system integrity and data security.
description: This rule checks whether ACLs alarms are configured for alert policies
  within Google Cloud Monitoring. It verifies that changes to access control lists
  trigger alerts, enabling timely responses to unauthorized modifications. To ensure
  compliance, review your alert policies and configure alarms for ACL changes using
  the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI. Remediation involves setting up notification
  channels and defining conditions for ACL change alerts.
