title: Ensure Minimum Retention for Data Analytics Logs in Alert Policies
rationale: Retaining data analytics logs for a minimum period is crucial to ensure
  that any anomalies or security incidents can be thoroughly investigated. Insufficient
  retention may lead to data loss, making it difficult to perform forensic analysis
  and comply with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate specific
  data retention periods.
description: This rule checks that the retention period for data analytics logs within
  GCP alert policies is set to a minimum of 30 days. This ensures that logs are available
  for auditing and forensic purposes. To verify, review the alert policy settings
  in the GCP Console under 'Logging' and ensure the retention period is configured
  correctly. If not, update the policy settings to extend the log retention period
  to meet compliance requirements.
