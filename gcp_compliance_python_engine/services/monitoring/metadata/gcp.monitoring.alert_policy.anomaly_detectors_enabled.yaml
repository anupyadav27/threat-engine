title: Enable Anomaly Detection in Monitoring Alert Policies
rationale: Enabling anomaly detection in monitoring alert policies helps identify
  unusual patterns in metrics that could indicate security breaches or operational
  issues. This proactive measure mitigates risks by alerting administrators to potential
  threats or system failures, ensuring timely response. It also assists in maintaining
  compliance with standards requiring continuous monitoring and threat detection,
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if anomaly detection is enabled in GCP Monitoring alert
  policies. Anomaly detection uses AI to automatically learn your system's normal
  behavior and alerts on deviations. To verify, ensure your alert policies in the
  Cloud Monitoring console have anomaly detection configured. Remediate by accessing
  the GCP Console, navigating to 'Monitoring', selecting 'Alerting', and enabling
  anomaly detection on relevant policies. This enhances your capability to detect
  and respond to incidents promptly.
