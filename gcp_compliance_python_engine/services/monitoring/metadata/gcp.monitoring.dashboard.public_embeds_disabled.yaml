title: Disable Public Embeds on Monitoring Dashboards
rationale: Allowing public embeds on GCP Monitoring Dashboards can expose sensitive
  operational metrics to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches and
  security incidents. This exposure can also result in non-compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict controls over data access and sharing.
  Unauthorized access to dashboard data could be leveraged by attackers to gain insights
  into system vulnerabilities or operational weaknesses.
description: This rule checks if public embeds are enabled on GCP Monitoring Dashboards,
  which could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive monitoring data. It is
  critical to ensure that only authenticated and authorized personnel have access
  to these dashboards to maintain data integrity and confidentiality. To remediate,
  audit all GCP Monitoring Dashboards and disable public embeds by setting access
  controls to authenticated users only. This involves configuring IAM policies to
  restrict public access and verifying permissions periodically to ensure compliance
  with security best practices.
