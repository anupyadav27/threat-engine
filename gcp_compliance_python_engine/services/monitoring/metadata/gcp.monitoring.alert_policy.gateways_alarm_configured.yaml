subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Ensure Monitoring Alert Policies for Gateways are Configured
rationale: Configuring alert policies for gateways is essential to promptly detect
  and respond to potential security breaches or system failures. This helps maintain
  continuous operation and protects sensitive data from being exposed due to gateway
  vulnerabilities. Compliance with security frameworks often requires proactive monitoring
  and alerts to mitigate risks associated with gateway misconfigurations.
description: This rule checks whether alert policies are configured for monitoring
  gateways, which are critical components for managing data flow and security. Verify
  that alert policies are set to trigger notifications for anomalies or performance
  issues. Remediation involves accessing the GCP Console, navigating to Monitoring,
  and creating or updating alert policies to include gateway-specific metrics and
  conditions. Ensure alerts are directed to responsible teams for quick action.
