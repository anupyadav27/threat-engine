title: Enable Data Analytics Query Access Logging
rationale: Enabling data analytics query access logging is crucial for detecting unauthorized
  access and usage patterns. This enhances visibility into data access activities,
  which is essential for compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, and helps
  in identifying potential data breaches or insider threats.
description: This rule checks if query access logging is enabled for data analytics
  services in GCP. It involves configuring Cloud Audit Logs to capture all query activities,
  ensuring that any access to data is logged for auditing purposes. To verify and
  remediate, ensure that logging is enabled via the GCP Console or gcloud CLI for
  the relevant services, such as BigQuery. Regularly review these logs to identify
  any suspicious activities and maintain compliance with industry standards.
