subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for DR Runbook Access in GCS Buckets
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Disaster Recovery (DR) runbook access
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure or modification. This is critical
  in maintaining data integrity and availability, especially during DR scenarios.
  Failing to enforce this can lead to compliance violations and potential data breaches,
  impacting business continuity and trust.
description: This rule checks that only essential personnel have access to Google
  Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets containing DR runbooks, ensuring roles are assigned
  based on least privilege principles. Verify that IAM policies limit permissions
  to necessary actions only, such as 'storage.objects.get'. Remediation involves auditing
  current permissions and adjusting IAM policies to restrict access appropriately,
  using predefined roles or custom roles tailored to specific operational needs.
