service: storage
resource: notification
requirement: Data Protection Bucket Destination Encrypted
scope: storage.notification.encryption

subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Storage Notification Buckets Are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting bucket destinations for storage notifications is critical to
  protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches. Without encryption,
  data stored in these buckets is vulnerable to exposure, violating compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and ISO 27001, and could lead to significant financial
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that all bucket destinations for storage notifications
  have encryption enabled at rest. It verifies the use of Google-managed encryption
  keys or customer-supplied encryption keys to ensure data security. To remediate,
  configure the bucket to use encryption by setting the appropriate key management
  settings in the Google Cloud Console or via the command line interface (CLI).
