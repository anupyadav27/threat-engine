service: storage
resource: bucket
requirement: Data Protection Bucket Deny Insecure Transport
scope: storage.bucket.security
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: low
title: Ensure Buckets Deny Insecure Transport
rationale: Allowing insecure transport to storage buckets can expose sensitive data
  to interception and unauthorized access. This poses risks such as data breaches
  and non-compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS, which mandate secure data transmission.
  Enforcing secure transport ensures data integrity and confidentiality, protecting
  organizational and customer data.
description: This rule checks if GCP storage buckets are configured to deny requests
  made over insecure transport protocols. Buckets should enforce HTTPS by setting
  the 'Enforce TLS' option, ensuring that data is transmitted securely. To verify,
  check the bucket's configuration for 'Enforce HTTPS' and ensure it is enabled. If
  disabled, update the bucket's settings to enforce HTTPS to mitigate the risk of
  data interception.
