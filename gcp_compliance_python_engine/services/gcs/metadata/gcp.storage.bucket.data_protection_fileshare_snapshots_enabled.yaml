title: Ensure Fileshare Snapshots are Enabled for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling fileshare snapshots for GCP storage buckets enhances data resiliency
  by providing point-in-time recovery options. This feature mitigates the risk of
  data loss due to accidental deletion, data corruption, or ransomware attacks. It
  supports compliance with data protection regulations by maintaining data integrity
  and availability.
description: This rule checks if fileshare snapshots are enabled for GCP storage buckets,
  which are crucial for backup and recovery processes. To verify, ensure that the
  snapshot schedule is configured and active for each bucket. Remediation involves
  accessing the Google Cloud Console, navigating to the relevant bucket, and setting
  up a snapshot schedule under the 'Backups' section. This ensures that data snapshots
  are regularly captured and stored securely.
