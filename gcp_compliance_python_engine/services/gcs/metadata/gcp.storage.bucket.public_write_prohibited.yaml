title: Prevent Public Write Access to Cloud Storage Buckets
rationale: Allowing public write access to storage buckets can lead to unauthorized
  data modifications, data exfiltration, and potential service abuse, which may result
  in significant data loss, service disruption, and reputational damage. Ensuring
  buckets are not publicly writable helps comply with regulatory standards such as
  PCI-DSS and SOC2, which mandate strict access controls to sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if any Google Cloud Storage buckets have public write
  access enabled. Public write access allows any internet user to upload or modify
  data, which poses a severe security risk. To verify, inspect the bucket's IAM policy
  and ensure 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' do not have roles/storage.objectCreator
  or roles/storage.objectAdmin. Remediation involves modifying the bucket's IAM policy
  to restrict unauthorized write access.
