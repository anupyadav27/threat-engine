title: Enforce Public Access Blocking on GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Blocking public access to storage buckets is crucial for preventing unauthorized
  data exposure, which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. Publicly
  accessible storage buckets can be exploited by attackers to access sensitive information,
  resulting in significant financial and reputational damage. Ensuring buckets are
  not publicly accessible aligns with regulatory requirements and best practices for
  data security.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Storage buckets have public access blocks
  enabled, which prevents all unauthorized users from accessing bucket data. Verify
  that public access is disabled by using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to inspect
  bucket IAM policies and access controls. To remediate, configure the bucket's permissions
  to restrict public access through the GCP Console or by executing gcloud storage
  commands to set the correct IAM policies.
