title: Enable Object Versioning for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling object versioning in GCP Storage Buckets protects against accidental
  data loss or overwrites by keeping previous versions of objects. This is crucial
  for business continuity and data integrity, and can help meet compliance requirements
  for data retention and audit controls.
description: This rule checks if object versioning is enabled on GCP Storage Buckets.
  Object versioning allows you to retrieve older versions of objects, providing a
  safeguard against accidental deletions or changes. To verify, use the `gsutil versioning
  get gs://[BUCKET_NAME]` command; 'Enabled' should be returned. Remediate by executing
  `gsutil versioning set on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]` to enable versioning.
