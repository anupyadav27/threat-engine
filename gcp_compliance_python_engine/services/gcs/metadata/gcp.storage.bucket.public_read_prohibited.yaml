title: Ensure Google Cloud Storage Buckets Are Not Publicly Readable
rationale: Allowing public read access to storage buckets can lead to unauthorized
  data exposure, resulting in potential data breaches and reputational damage. It
  is critical to prevent public access to sensitive information to comply with privacy
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, and to mitigate risks associated with insider
  threats and external attackers.
description: This rule checks for Google Cloud Storage buckets with configurations
  that allow public read access. To ensure compliance, verify that the bucket's IAM
  policies do not include roles like 'roles/storage.objectViewer' assigned to 'allUsers'
  or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'. Remediate by removing these roles or setting bucket
  policies that restrict access to authorized users only using IAM conditions or bucket
  policies.
