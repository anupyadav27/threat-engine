title: Ensure Cross-Region Replication for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling replication for storage buckets enhances data durability and availability
  by automatically syncing data across regions, mitigating risks from regional outages,
  and ensuring compliance with data residency requirements. This is critical for business
  continuity, protecting against data loss, and adhering to regulations that mandate
  data redundancy and availability.
description: This rule checks if cross-region replication is enabled for Google Cloud
  Storage buckets. To verify, ensure that bucket configurations include replication
  policies specifying the destination location and data classes. Remediation involves
  configuring the bucket with a replication policy using the Google Cloud Console
  or CLI, specifying source and destination buckets and regions appropriately.
