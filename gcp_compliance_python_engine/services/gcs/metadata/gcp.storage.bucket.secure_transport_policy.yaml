title: Ensure Secure Transport for GCS Buckets
rationale: Securing data in transit by enforcing secure transport policies on Google
  Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets is crucial to prevent unauthorized interception and
  access. This reduces the risk of data breaches and ensures compliance with regulations
  like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate secure data transmission. Business operations
  can be severely impacted by data leaks, leading to financial loss and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks that all GCS buckets enforce a policy requiring secure
  transport (HTTPS) for data transmission. To verify, review the bucket policies to
  ensure 'secureTransport' is set. If not configured, update the bucket's IAM policies
  to include a condition that denies requests without secure transport. This ensures
  data is encrypted in transit, aligning with security and compliance standards.
