service: storage
resource: bucket
requirement: DR Documentation Encrypted And Private
scope: storage.bucket.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DR Documentation Buckets are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Unencrypted or publicly accessible disaster recovery (DR) documentation
  can expose sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Ensuring encryption at rest and restricting access to these buckets is critical
  for compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, and helps mitigate risks
  associated with data leakage in case of a security incident.
description: This rule checks if DR documentation stored in GCP Storage Buckets is
  encrypted using Google-managed encryption keys and is not publicly accessible. Verify
  bucket settings in the Google Cloud Console under 'Cloud Storage' by checking 'Permissions'
  to ensure only authorized users have access, and under 'Configuration' to confirm
  encryption settings are enabled. To remediate, configure the bucket to use Google-managed
  keys for encryption and update IAM policies to restrict access.
