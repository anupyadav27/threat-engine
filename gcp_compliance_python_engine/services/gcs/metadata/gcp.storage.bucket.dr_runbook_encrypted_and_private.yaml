subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DR Runbooks Are Encrypted and Access-Controlled
rationale: Encrypting and restricting access to disaster recovery (DR) runbooks is
  crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive operational procedures. A breach
  could lead to exposure of critical recovery steps, potentially aiding attackers
  in disrupting recovery efforts. Compliance with data protection standards like PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001 mandates the protection of such sensitive information.
description: This rule checks that DR runbooks stored in GCP buckets are encrypted
  with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) and have restricted access controls.
  Verify that buckets containing DR runbooks have CMEK enabled and IAM policies configured
  to limit access to authorized personnel only. Remediate by updating bucket settings
  to use CMEK and reviewing IAM policies regularly to ensure compliance with the principle
  of least privilege.
