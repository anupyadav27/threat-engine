title: Enable Encryption at Rest for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Encryption at rest protects sensitive data from unauthorized access, ensuring
  that even if physical media is compromised, the data remains secure. It is crucial
  for maintaining customer trust, achieving compliance with regulations such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, and mitigating risks associated with data breaches and insider
  threats.
description: This rule checks whether encryption at rest is enabled for GCP storage
  buckets, ensuring that all data is automatically encrypted using Google-managed
  keys or customer-supplied keys. Verification involves checking bucket settings for
  encryption configuration. To remediate, configure bucket settings to enable encryption
  at rest, preferably using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for greater control.
  This can be done via the GCP Console, CLI, or API.
