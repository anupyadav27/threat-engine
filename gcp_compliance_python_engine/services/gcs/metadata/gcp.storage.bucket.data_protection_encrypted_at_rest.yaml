title: Ensure Cloud Storage Buckets are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in Cloud Storage is crucial for protecting sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This security
  measure helps mitigate risks associated with compromised credentials and unauthorized
  access to storage infrastructure. It also supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate data protection and privacy.
description: This rule checks if Cloud Storage buckets have server-side encryption
  enabled by default. It verifies that encryption keys, either Google-managed or customer-managed,
  are used to encrypt data at rest. To ensure compliance, review bucket settings in
  the GCP Console or using gcloud CLI, and enable default encryption if not already
  configured. This can be done by specifying a default key or allowing Google to manage
  the encryption keys automatically.
