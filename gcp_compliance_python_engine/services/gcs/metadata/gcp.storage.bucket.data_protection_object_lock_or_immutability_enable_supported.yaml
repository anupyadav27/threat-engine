title: Enable Object Lock or Immutability for Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling Object Lock or immutability on storage buckets prevents accidental
  or malicious data deletion or alteration, ensuring data integrity and compliance
  with regulations such as SEC Rule 17a-4(f) and financial data retention policies.
  This not only mitigates risks of data breaches and loss but also aids in meeting
  legal and compliance requirements for data preservation.
description: This rule checks whether Object Lock or immutability is enabled on GCP
  storage buckets. Object Lock allows you to configure a bucket's data retention settings
  to prevent any changes to objects during a specified retention period. To verify,
  inspect bucket settings in the GCP Console or through gcloud CLI for Object Lock
  configuration. Remediation involves enabling Object Lock via the Console under bucket
  settings or using appropriate gcloud commands to set retention policies.
