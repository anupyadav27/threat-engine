title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for Cloud Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Cloud Storage buckets is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Unencrypted
  data can be exposed if compromised, leading to severe financial and reputational
  damage. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS mandates encryption
  to safeguard personal and financial information.
description: This rule checks if server-side encryption is enabled for Google Cloud
  Storage buckets. Cloud Storage supports encryption by default, but verifying that
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed keys are active ensures
  enhanced data security. To verify, navigate to the Cloud Console, go to Storage,
  select the bucket, and check the encryption settings. Remediate by enabling encryption
  through the 'Edit' option in the bucket settings, choosing the appropriate key management
  option.
