title: Enable Server Access Logging for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling server access logging for GCP storage buckets provides visibility
  into access patterns and operations performed on the bucket. This is crucial for
  detecting unauthorized access, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining compliance
  with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and SOC2. Without logging, it
  is challenging to investigate security incidents and implement effective access
  controls.
description: This rule checks whether server access logging is enabled for GCP storage
  buckets. To verify, ensure that the bucket has a log configuration directing logs
  to a designated logging bucket with proper permissions. Logs should be reviewed
  regularly for suspicious activities. Remediation involves configuring the logging
  settings through the GCP Console or using the `gsutil logging set` command to specify
  a logging bucket.
