rule_id: gcp.storage.bucket.dr_documentation_access_rbac_least_privilege
service: storage
resource: bucket
requirement: DR Documentation Access RBAC Least Privilege
scope: storage.bucket.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Restrict DR Documentation Bucket Access to Least Privilege
rationale: Ensuring least privilege access to DR documentation in GCP Storage reduces
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure, which can lead to data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Limiting access to essential personnel minimizes
  the attack surface and protects sensitive recovery documentation critical for business
  continuity.
description: This rule checks that access to GCP Storage buckets containing DR documentation
  is restricted to the minimum necessary permissions. Verify IAM policies to ensure
  that only users with a legitimate need have read or write access to these buckets.
  Remediation involves reviewing and modifying IAM policies to remove excessive permissions,
  utilizing Google Cloud IAM roles effectively to enforce least privilege.
