title: Enable Versioning for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling versioning on storage buckets is crucial for data integrity and
  recovery, as it allows the restoration of previous versions of objects in case of
  accidental deletion or overwriting. This capability mitigates risks of data loss
  due to user errors or malicious activity, and supports compliance with data retention
  policies and regulatory standards that mandate data recovery options.
description: 'This rule checks if versioning is enabled on Google Cloud Storage buckets.
  Versioning maintains a history of all changes made to objects within a bucket, facilitating
  rollback in case of unintended modifications. To verify, check the bucket''s configuration
  settings in the GCP Console or via the gcloud CLI. Remediation involves enabling
  versioning by setting the ''versioning'' configuration to ''enabled'' using the
  GCP Console or through the gcloud CLI command: ''gcloud storage buckets update BUCKET_NAME
  --versioning''.'
