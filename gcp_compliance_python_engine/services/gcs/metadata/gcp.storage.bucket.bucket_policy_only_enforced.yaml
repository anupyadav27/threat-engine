title: Ensure Bucket Policy Only is Enforced on GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enforcing Bucket Policy Only on GCP Storage Buckets ensures that all access
  is controlled exclusively through Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
  This reduces the risk of unauthorized access through less secure, legacy ACLs, aligning
  with modern security practices and compliance requirements like CIS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that GCP Storage Buckets have 'Bucket Policy Only' enabled,
  meaning that the bucket's access is governed solely by IAM policies, not ACLs. To
  verify, examine the bucket's settings in the GCP Console or use the gcloud command-line
  tool. Remediation involves updating the bucket's configuration to enable Bucket
  Policy Only, ensuring access control is centralized and consistent.
