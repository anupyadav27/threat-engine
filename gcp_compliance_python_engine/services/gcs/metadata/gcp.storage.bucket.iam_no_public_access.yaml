title: Ensure GCS Buckets Do Not Allow Public Access
rationale: Publicly accessible storage buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring buckets are
  not publicly accessible protects against unintended data exposure and supports adherence
  to compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for Google Cloud Storage buckets that are publicly accessible
  due to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' having access in the IAM policy. To
  verify, review the bucket's IAM policy and remove any public roles. Remediation
  involves setting the IAM policy to restrict access only to specific users or service
  accounts with necessity. Implement a policy to regularly audit bucket permissions
  to prevent future exposures.
