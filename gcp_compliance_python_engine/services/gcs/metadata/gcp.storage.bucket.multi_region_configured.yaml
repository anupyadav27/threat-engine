title: Ensure GCP Buckets are Configured with Multi-Region Locations
rationale: Configuring buckets with multi-region locations enhances data availability
  and resilience against regional outages. This is crucial for business continuity
  and can mitigate risks associated with data loss or access issues in a single region.
  Compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001 and SOC2 often requires robust
  data availability measures.
description: This rule checks if GCP storage buckets are configured with multi-region
  locations, ensuring data is replicated across multiple geographic areas. Verify
  the bucket's location settings in the GCP Console under 'Storage' or via GCP CLI.
  To remediate, update bucket configurations to a multi-region setting, such as 'us',
  'eu', or 'asia', to ensure data durability and access across different regions.
