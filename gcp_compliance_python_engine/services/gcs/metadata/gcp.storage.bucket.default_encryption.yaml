title: Ensure Default Encryption for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Default encryption for Google Cloud Storage buckets is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without
  encryption, data stored in buckets is vulnerable to interception or exposure, posing
  significant risks to data privacy and compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
  Implementing default encryption helps in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality,
  ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks that all Google Cloud Storage buckets have default encryption
  configured. To verify, ensure that a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) or a
  Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) is set for the bucket. Remediation involves
  configuring the bucket to use default encryption by updating the bucket's settings
  via the GCP Console or the gcloud command-line tool. It is recommended to review
  and rotate encryption keys regularly to maintain security hygiene.
