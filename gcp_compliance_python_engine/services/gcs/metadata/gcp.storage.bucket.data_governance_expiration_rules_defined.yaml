title: Ensure Bucket Lifecycle Rules for Data Expiration are Configured
rationale: Defining data expiration rules for GCP storage buckets supports effective
  data lifecycle management, reducing storage costs and minimizing risks of unauthorized
  data access. Without expiration rules, organizations may retain data longer than
  necessary, increasing exposure to data breaches and complicating compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Storage buckets have lifecycle policies
  configured to automatically delete or archive data after a specified period. Ensure
  that each bucket has a well-defined lifecycle policy that aligns with data retention
  requirements. To verify, review the bucket's lifecycle configuration in the Cloud
  Console or via the gcloud CLI. To remediate, define lifecycle rules that specify
  conditions for data expiration and actions to take, such as deleting or transitioning
  objects.
