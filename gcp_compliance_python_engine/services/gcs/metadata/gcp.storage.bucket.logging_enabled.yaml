title: Ensure Storage Bucket Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging on storage buckets provides visibility into access patterns
  and operations, which is crucial for detecting unauthorized access, anomalous behavior,
  and potential data breaches. It supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  by maintaining a record of data access and changes, thereby helping in audits and
  incident response processes.
description: This rule checks that logging is enabled for Google Cloud Storage buckets.
  To verify, ensure that the bucket's logging configuration is set to deliver log
  records to a specified logging bucket. Remediation involves using the Google Cloud
  Console or gcloud CLI to enable logging by specifying a target bucket for log storage.
  This helps in maintaining an audit trail of all activities performed on the bucket.
