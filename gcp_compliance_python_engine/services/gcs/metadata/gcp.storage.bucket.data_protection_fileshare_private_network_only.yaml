title: Ensure GCP Storage Buckets Use Private Network Access
rationale: Restricting GCP Storage Buckets to private network access minimizes exposure
  to unauthorized entities, lowering the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations. This control is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from public internet exposure and aligns with principles of least privilege
  and network segmentation, which are vital for meeting regulatory standards like
  GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that GCP Storage Buckets are configured to allow access
  only from private networks, specifically by implementing VPC Service Controls. To
  verify compliance, ensure that your Storage Bucket access is restricted using private
  IPs and that the 'public access prevention' feature is enabled. Remediation involves
  configuring your VPC network settings to include only trusted subnets and utilizing
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to enforce this constraint.
