title: Ensure Data Governance Policies for GCS Buckets
rationale: Defining and enforcing data governance policies for Google Cloud Storage
  (GCS) buckets is critical to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and
  ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Without these policies, organizations
  risk data breaches, potential financial penalties, and damage to reputation due
  to non-compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether data governance policies have been defined for
  GCS buckets, focusing on encryption settings and access controls. Administrators
  should ensure that all buckets have defined policies that specify encryption at
  rest using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) and enforce least privilege access.
  Remediation involves setting bucket policies in the GCP Console or using the gcloud
  command-line tool to apply encryption and access controls.
