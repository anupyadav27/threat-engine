subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: low
title: Disallow Wildcards for Storage Bucket Actions/Principals
rationale: Using wildcards in IAM policies for actions or principals can lead to unauthorized
  access and data exposure by inadvertently granting overly broad permissions. This
  practice increases the attack surface and risks violating compliance standards such
  as PCI-DSS or HIPAA, potentially leading to data breaches and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks for IAM policies on GCP storage buckets that use wildcard
  characters in action or principal specifications, which can grant unintended access.
  To verify, review the bucket's IAM policy and ensure specific actions and principals
  are defined. Remediation involves replacing wildcards with explicit permissions,
  ensuring that only necessary roles are assigned to specific users or service accounts.
