title: Enable Access Logging for Google Cloud Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling access logging for Google Cloud Storage buckets is crucial for
  tracking and analyzing who accesses the data and how often. This helps in identifying
  unauthorized access attempts, understanding usage patterns, and meeting compliance
  requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate detailed logging of data access
  and usage.
description: This rule checks whether access logging is enabled for all Google Cloud
  Storage buckets. Enabling logging involves configuring the bucket to write access
  logs to a specified destination bucket. To verify, check the bucket's properties
  for a logging configuration. Remediation involves using the Google Cloud Console
  or CLI to set a logging destination bucket, ensuring that logs are retained and
  monitored regularly.
