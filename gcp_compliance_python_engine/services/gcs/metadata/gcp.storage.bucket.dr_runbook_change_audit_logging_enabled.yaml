title: Ensure Audit Logging for DR Runbook Changes in Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Disaster Recovery (DR) runbook changes in Google
  Cloud Storage buckets is critical to identify unauthorized access and modifications.
  This practice helps mitigate risks of data breaches and supports compliance with
  regulations requiring detailed audit trails, thereby protecting sensitive information
  and maintaining organizational integrity.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for changes to DR runbooks
  stored in GCP Storage buckets. Ensure that the bucket's logging configuration is
  set to capture all read and write access, as well as configuration changes. To verify,
  check the bucket's logging settings in the Google Cloud Console or use the `gsutil
  logging set` command. To remediate, enable logging by configuring the bucket to
  write logs to a dedicated logging bucket, ensuring that the logs are retained according
  to your organization's policy.
