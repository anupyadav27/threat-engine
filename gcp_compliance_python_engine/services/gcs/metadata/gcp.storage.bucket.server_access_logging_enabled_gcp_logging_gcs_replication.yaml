title: Enable Server Access Logging for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling server access logging for storage buckets is essential for monitoring
  and auditing access patterns. This helps in identifying unauthorized access attempts
  and understanding usage trends, thus mitigating security risks. It also supports
  compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require detailed access
  logs for sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether server access logging is enabled for GCP Storage
  buckets. To verify, ensure that the 'logging' configuration of each bucket includes
  a destination bucket for log delivery. To remediate, configure the source bucket
  to log to a designated logging bucket by specifying the logging target in the bucket's
  settings. This setup captures all access logs, aiding in security audits and incident
  response.
