title: Prevent Public Write Access to Storage Buckets
rationale: Allowing public write access to storage buckets poses significant security
  risks, including unauthorized data insertion or overwriting, which can lead to data
  corruption or leakage. This misconfiguration can also lead to compliance violations
  with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA, which mandate the protection of sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and modification.
description: This rule checks for storage buckets in Google Cloud Platform that are
  configured to allow public write access. Specifically, it identifies buckets with
  IAM policies granting the 'roles/storage.objectCreator' or 'roles/storage.objectAdmin'
  permissions to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'. To remediate, review and modify
  the bucket's IAM policy to restrict write permissions to trusted and authorized
  users only. Use the GCP console or CLI to audit and update bucket policies.
