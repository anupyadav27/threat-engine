title: Enable Server Access Logging for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling server access logging on GCP storage buckets is crucial for monitoring
  and auditing purposes. It helps organizations track access to their data, identify
  any unauthorized access attempts, and meet compliance requirements for data access
  logging. This is essential for detecting potential security breaches and ensuring
  accountability in data handling.
description: This rule checks if server access logging is enabled for GCP storage
  buckets. To verify, ensure that the bucket's logging configuration targets a destination
  bucket for log delivery. Remediation involves configuring the bucket to send access
  logs to a designated bucket, ensuring the destination bucket has the appropriate
  permissions to receive logs. Regular review of these logs can help in identifying
  suspicious activities.
