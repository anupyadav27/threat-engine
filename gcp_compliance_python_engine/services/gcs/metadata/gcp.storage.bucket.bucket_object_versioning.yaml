title: Enable Object Versioning for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling object versioning in GCP Storage Buckets is essential for data
  integrity and recovery, providing a mechanism to restore previous versions of objects
  in case of accidental deletion or overwriting. It mitigates risks associated with
  data loss and supports compliance with data protection regulations by ensuring data
  availability and resilience.
description: This rule checks if object versioning is enabled for GCP Storage Buckets,
  a feature that keeps a history of modifications to objects, allowing you to retrieve
  deleted or overwritten data. To enable versioning, navigate to the Cloud Console,
  select your bucket, and enable versioning under the 'Versioning' tab. This can also
  be set via the gcloud command-line tool using `gsutil versioning set on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]`.
  Regularly review and manage versions to optimize storage costs.
