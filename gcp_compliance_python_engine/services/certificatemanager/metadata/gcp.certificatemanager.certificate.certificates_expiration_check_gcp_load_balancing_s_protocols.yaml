requirement: Certificates Expiration Check Gcp Load Balancing S Protocols

domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest

title: Ensure Certificates Are Valid for GCP Load Balancing Protocols
rationale: Expired SSL/TLS certificates on GCP load balancers can lead to service
  disruptions and expose data in transit to interception, increasing vulnerability
  to man-in-the-middle attacks. Regularly checking certificate expiration supports
  compliance with data protection standards such as PCI-DSS, ensuring secure data
  transmission.
description: This rule verifies that SSL/TLS certificates managed by GCP Certificate
  Manager for load balancing are not expired. It is essential to monitor certificate
  expiration dates and set up alerts for timely renewals. To remediate, implement
  automated certificate renewal processes and regularly audit certificate validity
  through the GCP console or API. Ensure all certificates associated with load balancers
  are valid and support secure protocols.
