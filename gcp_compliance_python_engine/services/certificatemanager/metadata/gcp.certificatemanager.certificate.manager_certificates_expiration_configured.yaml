title: Ensure Manager Certificates Have Expiration Configured
rationale: Properly configuring certificate expiration is critical to preventing the
  use of outdated cryptographic credentials, which can lead to vulnerabilities such
  as man-in-the-middle attacks. Regularly expiring certificates ensure that they are
  rotated and updated, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and helping to maintain
  trust in secure communications. Compliance with industry standards and regulations
  like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 often mandates periodic certificate renewal.
description: This rule checks that all certificates managed by Certificate Manager
  have an expiration date configured. Certificates without expiration dates may remain
  in use long after their intended lifespan, exposing systems to security risks. Verify
  that each certificate has an expiration policy set by using the Google Cloud Console
  or gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves setting an appropriate expiration
  date for certificates, and configuring alerts for certificate renewal prior to expiration.
