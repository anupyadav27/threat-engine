title: Monitor and Renew Expiring Certificates
rationale: Certificates play a critical role in securing data transmission. Expired
  certificates can lead to disrupted services, loss of customer trust, and exposure
  to man-in-the-middle attacks. Ensuring timely renewal is essential for maintaining
  secure and compliant operations, particularly under regulations like PCI-DSS and
  HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for certificates managed by GCP's Certificate Manager
  that are nearing expiration. Regular monitoring and renewal of these certificates
  are crucial to prevent service interruptions and vulnerabilities. To verify, review
  the certificate expiration date through the GCP Console or CLI. Set up alerts for
  certificates expiring within a 30-day window and automate renewals where possible.
