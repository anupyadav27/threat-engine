title: Ensure Certificates Expiration Check for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Regularly checking certificate expiration is crucial to prevent service
  disruptions and maintain secure communications. Expired certificates can lead to
  failed connections, exposing data to potential interception or unauthorized access.
  This practice supports compliance with security standards and reduces the risk of
  data breaches and operational downtime.
description: This rule checks whether the expiration of SSL/TLS certificates stored
  in GCP storage buckets is monitored and enforced. It requires configuring alerts
  for approaching expiration dates to ensure timely renewal. To verify, review certificate
  manager settings for alert configurations and automate renewal processes where possible.
  Enabling this check helps mitigate risks associated with expired certificates by
  maintaining continuous and secure operations.
