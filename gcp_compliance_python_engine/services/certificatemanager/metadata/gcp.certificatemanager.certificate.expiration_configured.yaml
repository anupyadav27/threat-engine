title: Ensure Certificate Expiration is Configured in Certificate Manager
rationale: Properly configuring certificate expiration is crucial to prevent service
  disruptions and ensure data integrity. Without expiration settings, certificates
  may become invalid without notice, leading to potential downtime, security vulnerabilities,
  and non-compliance with industry regulations such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks whether expiration settings are defined for certificates
  managed in GCP Certificate Manager. To verify, ensure that each certificate has
  a defined expiration date and that renewal processes are in place. To remediate,
  configure automatic renewals or set alerts for manual renewals to avoid unexpected
  certificate expiry, which can lead to service interruptions and security risks.
