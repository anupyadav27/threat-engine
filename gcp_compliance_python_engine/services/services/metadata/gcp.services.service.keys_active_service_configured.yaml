title: Ensure Service Account Keys Are Properly Managed
rationale: Improper management of service account keys can lead to unauthorized access
  to critical resources, data breaches, and compliance violations. Ensuring that keys
  are actively managed and configured minimizes the risk of exposure and aligns with
  data protection requirements under frameworks such as PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks whether service account keys are actively managed and
  configured according to best practices, ensuring encryption at rest and adherence
  to a minimal access principle. It verifies that keys are rotated regularly and unused
  keys are deleted. Remediation involves auditing existing keys, setting up key rotation
  policies, and using Google Cloud KMS for key management.
