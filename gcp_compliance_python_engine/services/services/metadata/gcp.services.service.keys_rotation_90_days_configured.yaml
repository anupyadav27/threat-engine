title: Enforce 90-Day Key Rotation for GCP Service Keys
rationale: Regular rotation of service keys mitigates the risk of key compromise,
  reducing the window of opportunity for unauthorized access. This practice aligns
  with security policies and compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001,
  which mandate regular key rotation to protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if service keys for GCP services are configured to rotate
  every 90 days. Regular rotation helps prevent the risks associated with long-term
  key exposure, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. To verify, review the
  key management settings in the GCP Console and ensure automated rotation is enabled.
  Remediation involves setting up a Cloud Scheduler job or using Cloud Functions to
  automate the key rotation process.
