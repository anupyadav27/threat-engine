title: Enforce Restrictions on Service Account Keys
rationale: Enforcing restrictions on service account keys is crucial to minimize the
  risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and services. Unrestricted keys pose
  a significant security risk as they can be exploited by attackers to gain entry
  into your cloud environment, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations
  with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that restrictions such as IP address and time-based
  restrictions are enforced on service account keys. To verify, ensure that every
  service account key has conditional IAM policies implemented. Remediation involves
  auditing existing keys, applying necessary restrictions, and rotating keys regularly
  to mitigate risk. Configure these settings using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud
  CLI for effective access control.
