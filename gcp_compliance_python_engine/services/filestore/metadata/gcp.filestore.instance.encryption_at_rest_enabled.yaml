title: Filestore Instances Must Have Encryption At Rest Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Filestore instances helps protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and ensures data integrity. In the event of a data
  breach or physical theft, encryption significantly reduces the risk of data exposure.
  Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS often mandates encryption
  of data at rest to safeguard personal and financial information.
description: This rule verifies that all Filestore instances have encryption at rest
  enabled, using Google-managed encryption keys by default. It ensures that data stored
  in Filestore is encrypted automatically, providing a layer of security against unauthorized
  data access. Administrators should check the Filestore instance settings and enable
  encryption at rest if it is not configured. Remediation involves navigating to the
  Filestore instance settings in the GCP Console and ensuring that encryption is enabled
  using either Google-managed or customer-managed keys.
