service: filestore
resource: instance
requirement: Have Backup Enabled
scope: filestore.instance.backup_recovery
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure Filestore Instances Have Backup Enabled
rationale: Enabling backups for Filestore instances is critical for data resilience
  and disaster recovery. Without backups, data loss due to accidental deletion, corruption,
  or cyber attacks can have severe implications on business continuity and compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Filestore instances have backups enabled to ensure
  data can be restored in case of loss or corruption. Verify by checking the Filestore
  instance settings in the GCP Console or using the gcloud command-line tool. To enable
  backups, navigate to the Filestore instance settings, and activate the backup option
  or configure a scheduled backup policy. This ensures data availability and minimizes
  downtime during recovery operations.
