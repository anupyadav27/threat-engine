title: Ensure GCP Filestore Instances Have Backups Enabled
rationale: Enabling backups for GCP Filestore instances is crucial to safeguard data
  against accidental deletion, corruption, or malicious attacks. Without backups,
  data loss can result in significant operational disruptions, financial loss, and
  non-compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that all GCP Filestore instances have backups enabled,
  ensuring that data can be recovered in the event of data loss or corruption. Administrators
  should configure automated backups through the GCP Console or CLI. To verify, check
  the backup configuration settings in the Filestore instance details. If backups
  are not enabled, use the console or 'gcloud filestore instances update' command
  to configure and enable backups.
