title: Enable Logging and Tracing for Cloud Functions
rationale: Enabling logging and tracing for Google Cloud Functions is crucial for
  monitoring function executions, diagnosing issues, and ensuring compliance with
  regulatory standards. This capability provides insights into the function's behavior
  and performance, helping to detect anomalies and unauthorized access, thereby mitigating
  potential security threats and operational inefficiencies.
description: This rule checks whether logging and tracing are enabled for Cloud Functions.
  To ensure compliance, verify that each function has 'logging' and 'tracing' configurations
  enabled within the Google Cloud Console or via deployment scripts. Remediation involves
  setting up Stackdriver Logging and enabling Cloud Trace to capture detailed execution
  logs and performance traces, which can be done by adjusting the function's environment
  variables and permissions.
