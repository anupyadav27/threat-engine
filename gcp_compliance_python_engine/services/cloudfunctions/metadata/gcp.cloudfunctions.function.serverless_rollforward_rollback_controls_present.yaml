title: Ensure Rollforward and Rollback Controls for Cloud Functions
rationale: Having rollforward and rollback controls in place for Google Cloud Functions
  mitigates the risk of deploying faulty code, which can lead to service disruptions,
  security vulnerabilities, and non-compliance with industry regulations. Such controls
  are crucial in maintaining operational resilience and ensuring that any issues can
  be quickly remediated by reverting to a known good state.
description: This rule checks that Cloud Functions have appropriate rollforward and
  rollback mechanisms implemented, allowing for safe deployment practices. Ensure
  versioning is enabled for functions to track changes and facilitate easy rollbacks
  if necessary. Remediation involves configuring deployment workflows to include automated
  rollback capabilities using tools like Google Cloud Build or third-party CI/CD solutions.
  Verification can be done by reviewing the deployment scripts and ensuring they include
  these controls.
