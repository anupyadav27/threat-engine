subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Cloud Functions Are Published and Immutable
rationale: Making serverless functions immutable after publication helps prevent unauthorized
  modifications that could introduce vulnerabilities or disrupt operations. This practice
  supports regulatory compliance by ensuring auditability and maintaining a secure
  baseline, reducing the risk of data breaches or service disruptions due to unapproved
  changes.
description: This rule checks whether Google Cloud Functions are configured to be
  published and immutable, ensuring that once deployed, they cannot be altered without
  going through proper version control processes. Verification involves checking that
  the functions are deployed from source control systems or using versioned artifacts.
  Remediation includes implementing a CI/CD pipeline that enforces immutability by
  deploying only version-tagged code from secure repositories.
