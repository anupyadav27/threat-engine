title: Ensure Concurrency Limit is Configured for Cloud Functions
rationale: Configuring a concurrency limit for Cloud Functions helps prevent resource
  exhaustion and ensures predictable performance under load. Without a set limit,
  functions may consume excessive resources, leading to increased costs, potential
  denial-of-service conditions, and performance degradation. This practice helps meet
  compliance requirements by maintaining system stability and availability.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud Functions have a concurrency limit configured.
  A specified limit restricts the number of concurrent executions, helping to control
  resource usage and costs. To verify, review the Cloud Function's settings in the
  GCP Console or use the gcloud CLI. Remediation involves setting a suitable concurrency
  limit based on expected load and performance requirements, which can be done via
  the GCP Console or by updating the function configuration using gcloud commands.
