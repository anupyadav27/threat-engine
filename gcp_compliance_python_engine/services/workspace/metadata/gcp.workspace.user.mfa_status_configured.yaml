title: Ensure MFA is Configured for Workspace Users
rationale: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a
  password. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to phishing attacks and credential
  theft, potentially leading to data breaches and loss of sensitive information. Compliance
  frameworks such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 often require MFA to secure access to critical
  systems and data.
description: This check verifies that all users in Google Workspace have MFA configured.
  It involves reviewing user account settings to ensure that MFA is enabled and enforced.
  Administrators can enforce MFA through the Google Admin Console by navigating to
  'Security > Authentication > 2-step verification' and setting policies that require
  all users to configure MFA. Remediation involves guiding users to complete the MFA
  setup process and ensuring policies are in place to mandate it for all accounts.
