title: Ensure Password Policy Min Length of 14 for IAM
rationale: Setting a minimum password length of 14 characters reduces the risk of
  successful brute force attacks and enhances the overall security posture of the
  organization by making passwords harder to guess. This aligns with compliance frameworks
  such as NIST and ISO 27001, which recommend robust password standards to protect
  sensitive data and access.
description: This rule checks whether the identity access password policy for an organization
  in GCP is configured with a minimum length of 14 characters. To verify, navigate
  to the GCP Console, access IAM & Admin, and inspect the organization's password
  policy settings. To remediate, update the password policy to enforce a minimum length
  of 14 characters through the 'gcloud' command-line tool or via the Console's 'Security
  settings'.
