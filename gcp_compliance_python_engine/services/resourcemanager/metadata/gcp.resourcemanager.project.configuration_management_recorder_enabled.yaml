service: resourcemanager
resource: project
requirement: Configuration Management Recorder Enabled
scope: resourcemanager.project.configuration_management
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Enable Configuration Management Recorder for Projects
rationale: Enabling Configuration Management Recorder ensures that any changes to
  project configurations are tracked, reducing the risk of unauthorized modifications
  and helping meet compliance with regulations like NIST and ISO 27001. This capability
  provides visibility into configuration changes, allowing for quick identification
  and response to potential security incidents.
description: This rule checks if the Configuration Management Recorder is enabled
  for GCP projects, which is crucial for maintaining an audit trail of configuration
  changes. To verify, ensure that Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled, which can be done
  via the GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves enabling the
  Cloud Asset Inventory API and ensuring logs are being captured and reviewed regularly.
