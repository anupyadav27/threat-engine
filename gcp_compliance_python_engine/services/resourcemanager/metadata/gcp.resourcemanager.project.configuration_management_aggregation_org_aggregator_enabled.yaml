title: Ensure Org Aggregator is Enabled for Configuration Management
rationale: Enabling the Organization Aggregator is crucial for consolidating configuration
  data across all projects under an organization. This facilitates comprehensive visibility
  into configuration settings, enabling proactive risk management and ensuring compliance
  with regulatory standards such as NIST and ISO 27001. Without aggregation, organizations
  may face challenges in identifying misconfigurations that could lead to security
  vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks if the Configuration Management Aggregation using an
  Organization Aggregator is enabled for all projects within an organization. Verify
  that the aggregator is set up in the Google Cloud Console under Organization Settings,
  ensuring it collects configuration data across projects. To remediate, enable the
  Organization Aggregator by navigating to the Configuration Management Settings and
  selecting 'Enable Aggregation'. This action allows centralized monitoring and auditing
  of security configurations.
