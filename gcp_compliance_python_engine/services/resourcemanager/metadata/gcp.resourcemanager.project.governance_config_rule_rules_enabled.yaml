title: Enable Governance Config Rules for Project Monitoring
rationale: Enabling governance config rules is crucial for continuous monitoring of
  project configurations and compliance with organizational policies. This helps in
  identifying misconfigurations early, reducing the risk of potential security breaches
  and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards like ISO 27001 and NIST. Failure
  to enable these rules can lead to undetected vulnerabilities and non-compliance
  issues, impacting business operations and reputation.
description: This rule checks whether governance configuration rules are enabled for
  projects in GCP. These rules ensure that project settings adhere to defined security
  and compliance standards. To verify, navigate to the GCP Console, access the 'IAM
  & Admin' section, and ensure that governance policies are configured correctly under
  'Org Policies'. Remediation includes setting up automated alerts and enabling necessary
  rules within the 'Config Management' dashboard to enforce compliance consistently.
