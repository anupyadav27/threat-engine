title: Enforce MFA for GCP Console Access Across Organization
rationale: Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to the GCP Console
  significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
  This control helps protect sensitive data and resources by ensuring that even if
  passwords are stolen, access cannot be gained without the second authentication
  factor. Compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 often mandates MFA
  for administrative access, thus supporting regulatory adherence and enhancing overall
  security posture.
description: This rule checks if multi-factor authentication is enforced for all users
  accessing the GCP Console within the organization. To verify, ensure that MFA is
  set up in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings under 'Security Settings'
  in the Google Cloud Console. Remediation involves configuring and enforcing MFA
  in the IAM policy settings, ensuring that all users are required to authenticate
  with an additional factor beyond just a password.
