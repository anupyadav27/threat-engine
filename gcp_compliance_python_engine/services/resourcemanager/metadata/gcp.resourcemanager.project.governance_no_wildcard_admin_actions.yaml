title: Prevent Wildcard Admin Roles in GCP Projects
rationale: Granting wildcard admin roles can expose projects to excessive access,
  increasing the risk of unauthorized activities, data breaches, and compliance violations.
  Ensuring roles are specific and limited helps mitigate insider threats and conforms
  to least privilege principles, aligning with regulatory requirements like NIST and
  ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for IAM policy bindings in GCP projects that grant overly
  permissive roles, such as 'roles/*admin', to any user or service account. To verify,
  review the IAM policies of your projects in the GCP Console or via the gcloud command-line
  tool. Remediation involves replacing wildcard roles with more specific permissions
  tailored to the user's needs, following the principle of least privilege.
