title: Restrict Wildcard Permissions on All GCP Resources
rationale: Allowing wildcard permissions on all resources ('*' on '*') in GCP can
  expose your cloud environment to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  This configuration violates the principle of least privilege, increasing the risk
  of accidental or malicious actions that can disrupt operations or result in data
  loss. Ensuring specific, limited permissions helps align with compliance frameworks
  such as ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS, which mandate stringent access controls.
description: This rule checks for and restricts the use of wildcard permissions ('*'
  on '*') in GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies at the project level.
  Specifically, it ensures that no IAM policy grants overly permissive access across
  all resources. To verify, examine IAM policy bindings for projects and identify
  any entries with 'roles/*' or 'members/*'. Remediate by replacing such entries with
  specific roles and members that follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring
  users and services have only the necessary permissions.
