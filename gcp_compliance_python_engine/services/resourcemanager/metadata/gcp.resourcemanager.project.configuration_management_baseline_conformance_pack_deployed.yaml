title: Deploy Configuration Management Baseline Conformance Pack
rationale: Implementing a Configuration Management Baseline Conformance Pack helps
  to ensure that all cloud resources comply with defined security best practices and
  organizational policies, reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could lead
  to vulnerabilities. It supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements, thereby safeguarding data integrity and privacy.
description: This check verifies whether a Configuration Management Baseline Conformance
  Pack is deployed across GCP projects. The conformance pack provides a predefined
  set of security controls and configuration checks, ensuring that instances meet
  baseline security requirements. To verify, review the deployment status of the conformance
  pack in the GCP Console under the Resource Manager section. Remediation involves
  deploying the pack using the Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform scripts provided
  by Google.
