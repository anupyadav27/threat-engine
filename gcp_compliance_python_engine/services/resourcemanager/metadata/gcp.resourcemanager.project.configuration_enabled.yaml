title: Ensure Project Configuration Management is Enabled
rationale: Enabling configuration management for GCP projects is crucial for maintaining
  consistent and secure infrastructure deployments. It helps in minimizing misconfigurations
  that can lead to vulnerabilities, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  or data breaches. Proper configuration management supports compliance with standards
  like NIST and ISO 27001 by enforcing structured control over resource settings.
description: This rule verifies that configuration management processes are enabled
  and actively monitoring GCP project settings. It checks for the use of tools like
  Google Cloud Deployment Manager to manage infrastructure as code, ensuring configurations
  are consistent and deviations are flagged. Remediation involves setting up deployment
  scripts and integrating them with CI/CD pipelines to automate and audit configurations.
  Regular reviews and updates should be scheduled to align with best practices.
