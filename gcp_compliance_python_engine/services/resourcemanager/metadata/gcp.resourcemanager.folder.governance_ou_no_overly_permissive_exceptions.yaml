title: Prevent Overly Permissive Folder IAM Policies
rationale: Overly permissive IAM policies on GCP folders can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This compromises the principle of least privilege,
  increasing the risk of insider threats and accidental data exposure. Adhering to
  strict IAM controls is crucial for meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for any IAM policies on GCP folders that grant broad
  permissions to users or service accounts, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
  It specifically looks for roles with excessive permissions that are not justified
  by business needs. To remediate, review the IAM policies on affected folders, remove
  any overly permissive roles, and ensure roles are aligned with the least privilege
  principle. Use GCP IAM Policy Analyzer to identify and adjust permissions.
