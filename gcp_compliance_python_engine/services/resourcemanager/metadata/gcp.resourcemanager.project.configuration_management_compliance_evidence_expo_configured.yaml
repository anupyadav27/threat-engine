service: resourcemanager
resource: project
requirement: Configuration Management Compliance Evidence Expo Configured
scope: resourcemanager.project.compliance
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Project Compliance Evidence Configuration
rationale: Ensuring that configuration management compliance evidence is properly
  configured is essential for maintaining audit readiness and minimizing security
  risks. Misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized changes, increasing the potential
  for data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards such as SOC2 and
  ISO 27001.
description: This rule verifies that projects within the Google Cloud Platform have
  configuration management compliance evidence explicitly configured. It checks for
  the presence of settings that document and track changes to project configurations,
  ensuring traceability and accountability. To remediate, enable Cloud Audit Logs
  for configuration changes and integrate with a centralized logging solution to store
  and review evidence.
