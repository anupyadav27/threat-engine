service: resourcemanager
resource: organization
requirement: Identity Access Tenant Inactive User Disable Thre Configured
scope: resourcemanager.organization.security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Inactive User Auto-Disable is Configured
rationale: Configuring auto-disable for inactive users mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access through orphaned accounts, which could be exploited by malicious actors.
  This control helps maintain a clean and secure identity environment, reducing potential
  attack surfaces and ensuring compliance with identity management best practices.
description: This rule checks if the organization has configured automatic disabling
  of inactive user accounts. Ensure that Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
  include automated processes to identify and disable user accounts that have not
  been used for a predefined period. This can be verified by reviewing the IAM policies
  and organization settings in the GCP Console. Remediation involves setting up appropriate
  lifecycle management policies to automatically suspend inactive accounts, using
  tools like Google Cloud's Identity Platform.
