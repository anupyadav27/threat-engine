title: Prevent IAM Wildcard Admin Roles on Projects
rationale: Allowing IAM roles with wildcard permissions poses a critical security
  risk as it grants excessive privileges, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized
  access, and non-compliance with regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and SOC2.
  This rule helps ensure that IAM policies adhere to the principle of least privilege,
  minimizing the attack surface and fortifying the project's security posture.
description: This rule verifies that IAM policies on GCP projects do not include wildcard
  ('*') permissions for administrative roles. To comply, ensure IAM roles are defined
  with specific permissions rather than using broad 'roles/*' grants. Remediation
  involves auditing current IAM roles, identifying wildcard permissions, and replacing
  them with roles that have tailored permissions matching the project's specific needs.
