subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Ensure Project Remediation Targets are Properly Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of remediation targets is crucial to ensure that any
  non-compliance issues are automatically addressed, minimizing security risks and
  maintaining adherence to compliance standards. Unbound or incorrectly configured
  targets can lead to unmanaged risks and potential breaches, impacting business continuity
  and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks that all projects within Google Cloud have their governance
  configuration rules associated with correctly specified remediation targets. It
  ensures that any violations trigger appropriate automated actions to rectify the
  situation. Verify the configuration by reviewing the project settings in the Google
  Cloud Console or using Cloud Shell with gcloud commands. To remediate, bind governance
  configuration rules to suitable Cloud Functions or other automation scripts that
  can address the violations.
