title: Enable Auto Remediation for High-Security Configurations
rationale: Auto remediation for configuration management in GCP projects ensures that
  security misconfigurations are automatically corrected, reducing the risk of exposure
  to threats. This is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting
  compliance requirements, as it minimizes human error and accelerates response times
  to potential vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks that automatic remediation is enabled for high-severity
  configuration management issues in GCP projects. It ensures that any detected misconfiguration
  related to instance configuration is automatically corrected to align with security
  best practices. To verify, review the project settings in the GCP Console under
  the 'Configuration Management' section and ensure the auto-remediation feature is
  activated. Remediation steps include enabling auto-remediation policies via the
  Google Cloud Console or using gcloud commands for automation.
