title: Ensure Organization Password Policy Compliance
rationale: Enforcing a strong password policy is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
  to GCP resources and protect sensitive data. Weak or insufficient password policies
  can lead to compromised accounts, data breaches, and potential financial and reputational
  damage. Compliance with password policy standards is also often required by regulatory
  frameworks such as NIST, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that your organization's password policy meets recommended
  security standards. It requires configuring the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  settings to enforce strong password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity,
  and expiration period. To verify compliance, review the IAM password policy settings
  in the Google Cloud Console under Security > Identity & Organization. Remediate
  by adjusting the password policy to meet or exceed the recommended security guidelines.
