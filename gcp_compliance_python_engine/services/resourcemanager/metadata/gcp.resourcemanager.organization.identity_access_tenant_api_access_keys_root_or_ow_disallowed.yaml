title: Restrict Root or Owner API Access Keys in GCP Organizations
rationale: Allowing root or owner access keys for Identity Access Tenant API poses
  significant security risks, such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and
  potential data breaches. It is crucial to enforce least privilege principles to
  mitigate threats and adhere to compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks whether any identity access tenant API access keys are
  assigned root or owner permissions in your GCP organization. Such permissions should
  be avoided to prevent excessive access rights that can lead to security vulnerabilities.
  To remediate, review IAM policies and ensure that API keys are assigned the minimum
  necessary permissions. Regularly audit key usage and rotate keys to maintain security
  hygiene.
