title: Block Disabling Critical Guardrail Services in GCP Projects
rationale: Disabling essential guardrail services such as identity and access management
  or logging can lead to increased security vulnerabilities and compliance failures.
  These guardrails are crucial for maintaining operational integrity and ensuring
  resilience against disruptions. Regulatory frameworks often require continuous monitoring
  and management of security controls, making this configuration vital for organizational
  compliance and risk management.
description: This rule checks that critical guardrail services are not disabled in
  GCP projects, such as IAM roles and audit logging. It verifies that these services
  are configured to prevent accidental or malicious changes that could compromise
  security. Remediation involves enabling and enforcing appropriate policies through
  Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Audit Logs, ensuring they are continuously
  active. Administrators should regularly audit these configurations to ensure compliance
  with organizational policies.
