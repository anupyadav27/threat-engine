service: resourcemanager
resource: project
requirement: Configuration Management Delivery KMS Encryption Enabled
scope: resourcemanager.project.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Config Management Delivery
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for configuration management delivery protects
  sensitive configuration data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This
  encryption ensures that data at rest is secure, aligning with compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, and mitigating risks associated with data exposure and unauthorized
  disclosure.
description: This rule checks whether Google Cloud's configuration management delivery
  processes are secured using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) encryption.
  To verify, ensure that the delivery of configuration data within the project is
  encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK) from KMS. Remediation involves creating
  or selecting a KMS key and configuring the project to use this key for encrypting
  configuration management delivery data.
