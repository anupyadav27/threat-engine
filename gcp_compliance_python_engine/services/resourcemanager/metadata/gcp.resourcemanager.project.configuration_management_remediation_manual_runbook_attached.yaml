scope: resourcemanager.project.configuration_management
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Attach Manual Runbooks for Configuration Remediation
rationale: Attaching a manual runbook for configuration management remediation ensures
  that any misconfiguration can be swiftly addressed, reducing downtime and potential
  security breaches. This is critical for maintaining compliance with regulatory standards
  and minimizing risk exposure by providing a clear, documented process for remediation.
description: This rule checks if a manual runbook is attached to each project for
  configuration management remediation. It requires documenting the steps necessary
  to address configuration issues, ensuring that these can be followed by any team
  member. To verify, ensure that each project has an associated runbook and that it's
  regularly updated to reflect current infrastructure and policies. Remediation involves
  creating a comprehensive runbook and integrating it with project management tools.
