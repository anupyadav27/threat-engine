title: Auto-enroll New Accounts in Config Management Aggregation
rationale: Automatically enrolling new accounts in configuration management aggregation
  ensures that all resources are consistently monitored and managed from inception,
  reducing the risk of misconfiguration and security gaps. This proactive approach
  mitigates threats associated with unsecured cloud resources and aids in maintaining
  compliance with industry standards by ensuring all project configurations are aligned
  with organizational security policies.
description: This rule verifies that new accounts within a GCP project are automatically
  enrolled in configuration management aggregation. It ensures that any new resources
  are immediately subject to the same configuration checks and policies as existing
  accounts. To verify, check the project's settings in the Google Cloud Console under
  Resource Manager and ensure that auto-enrollment is enabled for configuration management.
  Remediation involves enabling auto-enrollment by adjusting the project configuration
  settings to include all new accounts.
