title: Ensure Configuration Management Baseline Parameters Are Set
rationale: Establishing a configuration management baseline is crucial for maintaining
  consistent security postures across projects, minimizing misconfigurations, and
  ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Without a baseline, projects are
  vulnerable to inconsistent policies, leading to potential security breaches and
  compliance violations.
description: This rule checks whether a configuration management baseline has been
  set for projects in GCP. It involves reviewing project-level settings to ensure
  they adhere to predefined security policies and configuration standards. Verification
  can be done by examining project configurations via the GCP Console or CLI. Remediation
  involves implementing configuration management tools such as Google Cloud Deployment
  Manager or third-party solutions to maintain and enforce baseline configurations
  across all projects.
