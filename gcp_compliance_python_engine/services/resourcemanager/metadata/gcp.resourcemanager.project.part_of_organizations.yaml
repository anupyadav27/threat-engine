title: Ensure Project is Associated with an Organization
rationale: Associating GCP projects with an organization allows for centralized management
  and governance, reducing the risk of resource sprawl and potential security misconfigurations.
  It enforces consistent security policies, access control, and billing practices
  across all projects, which is critical for compliance with corporate and regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule checks if a GCP project is associated with an organization.
  Projects not linked to an organization may bypass organization-wide security policies,
  leading to potential vulnerabilities. Verify that projects are part of an organization
  by using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI. To remediate, attach the project to the
  appropriate organization or ensure new projects are created under an organization.
