title: Ensure All GCP Accounts Are Enrolled in the Organization
rationale: Enrolling all Google Cloud accounts in the organization's governance structure
  ensures consistent application of security policies, access controls, and auditing
  across the organization. This minimizes the risk of shadow IT, unauthorized access,
  and non-compliance with regulatory standards, safeguarding sensitive data and resources
  from potential breaches.
description: This rule checks whether all Google Cloud Platform accounts are properly
  enrolled under the organization's governance. To verify, ensure that each project
  is linked to the organization node and that identity and access management (IAM)
  policies are consistently applied. Remediation involves reviewing organizational
  policies, enrolling any standalone or unlinked accounts, and configuring IAM roles
  to enforce security standards uniformly across all accounts.
