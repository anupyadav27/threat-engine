title: Ensure Cloud Audit Logging Enabled for All Regions
rationale: Enabling Cloud Audit Logging across all regions is crucial for maintaining
  a comprehensive security posture. It allows organizations to track access and modifications
  to resources, providing critical insights into potential unauthorized activities.
  This is essential for meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and PCI-DSS,
  which mandate thorough audit logging and monitoring.
description: This rule checks if Cloud Audit Logging is enabled in all regions for
  projects within the Google Cloud Platform. Audit logs provide details of 'admin
  activity' and 'data access' actions performed in the system, which are necessary
  for security monitoring and forensic analysis. To verify, ensure that the Logging
  API is enabled and logs are being collected for all applicable services. Remediate
  by configuring the logging settings in the Cloud Console under Logging > Logs Explorer,
  and ensure the necessary IAM permissions are in place for log access.
