title: Enforce Password Policy to Prevent Reuse of Last 24 Passwords
rationale: Preventing password reuse is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access due to credential stuffing attacks and compromised accounts. Reusing passwords
  increases vulnerability to attacks where stolen passwords from other services are
  used. Compliance with security standards like NIST SP 800-63B that recommend against
  password reuse enhances organizational security posture.
description: This rule checks if the organization's password policy is configured
  to prevent the reuse of the last 24 passwords. It requires setting the 'passwordPolicy.passwordReusePrevention'
  field to '24' in the IAM policy. Verify this setting in the Google Cloud Console
  or by using the gcloud CLI. Remediation involves updating the IAM policy to enforce
  this password history setting, ensuring users cannot reuse any of their last 24
  passwords.
