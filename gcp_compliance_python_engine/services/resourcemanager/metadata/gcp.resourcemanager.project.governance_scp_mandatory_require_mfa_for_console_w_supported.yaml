title: Enforce MFA for GCP Console Access via Governance SCP
rationale: Requiring MFA for console access significantly mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access due to compromised credentials. This control is critical given the increased
  threat landscape where phishing attacks are prevalent. Implementing MFA aligns with
  compliance mandates such as NIST SP 800-63, PCI-DSS, and others that require strong
  authentication measures.
description: This rule ensures that all users accessing the GCP Console must authenticate
  using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The policy is enforced through Service
  Control Policies (SCPs) at the project level. To verify, check that IAM policies
  include MFA requirements for all users. Remediate by configuring IAM roles with
  conditions that require MFA and update organizational policies to enforce these
  requirements.
