title: Define Lockout Threshold in Identity Access Password Policy
rationale: Defining a lockout threshold in password policies mitigates the risk of
  unauthorized access due to brute force attacks. Without a lockout policy, repeated
  unauthorized login attempts could compromise sensitive organizational data and access.
  This control is crucial for regulatory compliance with standards such as NIST and
  PCI-DSS, which mandate strong authentication mechanisms.
description: This rule checks if a lockout threshold is defined in the Identity Access
  Management password policy for the organization in GCP. To verify, ensure the password
  policy includes a 'lockoutThreshold' setting that specifies the number of failed
  login attempts before an account is temporarily locked. Remediation involves configuring
  the 'lockoutThreshold' in the Google Cloud Console under IAM settings, which can
  be done by navigating to Security > Identity > Password Policies.
