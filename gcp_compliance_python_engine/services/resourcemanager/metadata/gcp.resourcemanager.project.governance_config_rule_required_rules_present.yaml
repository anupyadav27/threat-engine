title: Ensure Required Governance Config Rules Are Present
rationale: Having required governance configuration rules in place is crucial for
  maintaining visibility and control over project resources, reducing security risks
  such as unauthorized access and data breaches. It also ensures compliance with regulatory
  standards and internal governance policies, mitigating potential legal and financial
  repercussions for the organization.
description: This check verifies that all necessary governance configuration rules
  are implemented within a GCP project. It ensures that specified security and compliance
  controls are consistently applied, enabling effective monitoring and management
  of resources. To verify, review the project settings in the GCP Console and ensure
  compliance rules are active. Remediation involves configuring these rules through
  Cloud Asset Inventory and IAM policies to enforce governance standards.
