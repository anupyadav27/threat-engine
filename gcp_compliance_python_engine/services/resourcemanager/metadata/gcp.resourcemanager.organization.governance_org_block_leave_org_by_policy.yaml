service: resourcemanager
resource: organization
requirement: Governance Org Block Leave Org By Policy
scope: resourcemanager.organization.policy_management
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Enforce Org Membership via Policy Constraints
rationale: Blocking the ability to leave an organization via policy is crucial for
  maintaining governance and preventing unauthorized or accidental departures that
  could lead to compliance violations, data loss, or weakened security posture. This
  policy ensures ongoing accountability and control over resource management within
  the organization, aligning with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks for the enforcement of organization policies that prevent
  users from leaving the organization without proper authorization. It involves setting
  constraints in the Resource Manager to control this action. Administrators should
  verify that the organizational policy 'constraints/resourcemanager.organizationPolicy'
  is set to disallow leaving the organization. Remediation involves applying the necessary
  constraints through the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to ensure compliance with governance
  protocols.
