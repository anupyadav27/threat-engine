title: Track Global Resources with Configuration Management Recorder
rationale: Ensuring that all global resources are tracked using a Configuration Management
  Recorder reduces the risk of unmanaged changes that could lead to security vulnerabilities
  or compliance issues. This is crucial for maintaining an accurate inventory of resources
  and configurations, which is a fundamental part of security operations and audits.
  It helps in quickly identifying unauthorized changes and facilitates incident response
  and forensic analysis.
description: This rule checks if the Configuration Management Recorder is set to track
  global resources within a Google Cloud project. To verify, ensure that Cloud Asset
  Inventory is enabled and properly configured to capture all resources, including
  global types. Remediation involves enabling Cloud Asset Inventory and configuring
  it to monitor all necessary resources, ensuring comprehensive visibility and control
  over your project's configuration state.
