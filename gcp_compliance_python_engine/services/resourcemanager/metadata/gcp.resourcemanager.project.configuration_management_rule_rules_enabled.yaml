title: Ensure Configuration Management Rules are Enabled on Projects
rationale: Enabling configuration management rules on GCP projects helps ensure that
  resources are consistently and securely configured, reducing the risk of misconfigurations
  that could lead to security vulnerabilities. This practice supports compliance with
  regulatory requirements and prevents unauthorized access or data breaches by maintaining
  a secure baseline configuration.
description: This rule checks whether configuration management rules are enabled for
  GCP projects. It involves verifying that policies are in place to automatically
  enforce security configurations across all resources within the project. Remediation
  involves reviewing and enabling configuration management rules using the GCP Console
  or command-line tools to ensure all instances adhere to the defined security policies.
