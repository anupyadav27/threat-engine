service: resourcemanager
resource: project
requirement: Configuration Management Rule Remediation Targets Bound
scope: resourcemanager.project.configuration_management
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Project Remediation Targets Are Correctly Configured
rationale: Properly binding configuration management rule remediation targets ensures
  that corrective actions are automatically applied to misconfigured resources, reducing
  the risk of security breaches and compliance violations. This practice helps maintain
  organizational security posture by preventing unauthorized changes and ensuring
  consistency across cloud environments.
description: This rule checks if projects within GCP are configured to have remediation
  targets bound to configuration management rules, enabling automated corrections
  for identified misconfigurations. Verify that each project has the necessary settings
  to enforce remediation actions by checking the configuration management policy bindings.
  To remediate, ensure that the remediation targets are correctly defined in your
  configuration management tools and that they are associated with the appropriate
  rules and policies.
