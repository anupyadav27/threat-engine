severity: low
title: Ensure Configuration Drift Alerts are Set for GCP Projects
rationale: Configuration drift can lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing unauthorized
  changes that go unnoticed, potentially violating compliance standards and exposing
  your organization to risk. Proactively monitoring configuration changes helps maintain
  the integrity and security of your cloud environment, ensuring adherence to organizational
  policies and regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOC2.
description: This rule verifies that configuration drift alerts are enabled for GCP
  projects, ensuring that any unauthorized changes to project configurations are quickly
  detected and addressed. To configure drift alerts, set up monitoring and alerting
  using Google Cloud's Monitoring and Logging services to track configuration changes.
  Remediation involves enabling audit logging for Cloud Resource Manager and setting
  up alerting policies to notify administrators of any anomalies in project configurations.
