title: Enable GCP Configuration Management Compliance Dashboard
rationale: Enabling the Configuration Management Compliance Dashboard in GCP helps
  organizations monitor and ensure that their resource configurations align with internal
  policies and external compliance requirements. This is critical in identifying misconfigurations
  that could lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and non-compliance with
  standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001. By having visibility into configuration
  compliance, organizations can proactively address potential risks and maintain a
  robust security posture.
description: This rule checks whether the Configuration Management Compliance Dashboard
  is enabled for a GCP project, allowing for comprehensive compliance monitoring across
  resources. To verify, ensure that the dashboard is activated through the Google
  Cloud Console under the Security Command Center settings, and that necessary permissions
  are granted to view compliance reports. Remediate by enabling the dashboard and
  configuring it to track relevant compliance benchmarks applicable to your organization.
