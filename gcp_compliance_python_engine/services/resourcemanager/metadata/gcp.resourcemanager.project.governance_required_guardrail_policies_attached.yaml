title: Ensure Guardrail Policies are Attached to Projects
rationale: Attaching governance guardrail policies to GCP projects is crucial for
  ensuring resilience and disaster recovery. It helps in mitigating potential security
  risks by enforcing organizational policies that prevent unauthorized changes and
  promote compliance with industry standards. This reduces the likelihood of data
  loss or service disruptions, thereby protecting business continuity and regulatory
  compliance.
description: This rule checks whether all GCP projects have the required guardrail
  policies attached to enforce governance controls. These policies should include
  constraints that align with your organization's security and compliance requirements,
  such as restrictions on resource modifications and data handling practices. To verify
  compliance, review the IAM policy bindings and ensure the necessary policies are
  applied. Remediation involves using the gcloud command-line tool or Cloud Console
  to attach missing policies to the respective projects.
