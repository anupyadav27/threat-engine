severity: high
title: Enforce MFA for Break Glass Accounts in GCP Organizations
rationale: Break glass accounts are critical for emergency access and bypass usual
  security controls. Without enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), these accounts
  are susceptible to unauthorized access, posing a significant risk to organizational
  security. Ensuring MFA is enabled mitigates risks such as identity theft and unauthorized
  administrative actions, aligning with compliance mandates like NIST and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if Multi-Factor Authentication is enforced for break
  glass accounts within GCP organizations. Break glass accounts must have MFA enabled
  to provide an additional layer of security. Administrators should verify that all
  such accounts have MFA settings configured in the GCP Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) policies and ensure compliance by implementing MFA via Google Cloud Console
  or using API configurations. Remediation involves enabling MFA for these accounts
  and regularly auditing their settings.
