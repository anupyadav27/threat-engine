title: Enable Configuration Drift for Critical Resources
rationale: Enabling configuration management drift detection for critical resources
  ensures that any unauthorized or unintended changes are promptly identified and
  addressed. This reduces the risk of configuration errors that could lead to security
  vulnerabilities or compliance violations. It is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and availability of critical workloads and aligning with regulatory requirements
  such as NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks whether configuration management drift detection is
  enabled for critical resources within GCP projects. It involves verifying that tools
  like Google Cloud Config Connector or Terraform are configured to monitor and report
  any changes to resource configurations. To remediate, ensure that critical resources
  are tagged appropriately and that drift detection is enabled and actively monitored.
  Implement automated alerts and corrective actions to address detected drifts promptly.
