title: Enforce Password Complexity with Upper, Lower, and Special Characters
rationale: Implementing a robust password policy is crucial to mitigate risks of unauthorized
  access due to weak passwords. Passwords that require a combination of upper, lower
  case letters, and special characters significantly reduce the likelihood of successful
  brute force attacks. This measure is often required to comply with regulatory frameworks
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, ensuring that sensitive data is protected against
  unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks if the organization-level password policy in GCP mandates
  the use of upper case, lower case, and special characters. To verify compliance,
  review the organization's IAM password policy settings. To enforce this, navigate
  to 'IAM & Admin' in the GCP Console, select 'Security Settings', and configure the
  password policy to require upper, lower case letters, and special characters. This
  ensures that all user accounts adhere to strong password requirements.
