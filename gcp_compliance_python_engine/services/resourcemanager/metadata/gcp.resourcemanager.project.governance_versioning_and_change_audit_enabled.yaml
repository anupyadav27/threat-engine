title: Enable Governance Versioning and Change Audit for Projects
rationale: Enabling governance versioning and change auditing for projects is crucial
  to track modifications, detect unauthorized changes, and ensure accountability.
  This practice mitigates risks such as data breaches and unauthorized access, supporting
  compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 which require detailed audit
  trails for security events.
description: This rule checks whether governance versioning and change auditing is
  enabled for GCP projects. Ensure that Audit Logging is configured to record 'ADMIN_READ',
  'DATA_READ', and 'DATA_WRITE' activities in the Cloud Audit Logs for critical services.
  To verify, review the IAM policy for the project and confirm that necessary roles
  are assigned to capture audit logs. Remediation involves adjusting permissions and
  enabling logs in the Cloud Console or via gcloud commands.
