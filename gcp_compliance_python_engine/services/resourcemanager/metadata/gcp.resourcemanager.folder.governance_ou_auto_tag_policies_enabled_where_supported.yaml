title: Enable Auto Tag Policies for Governance in Folders
rationale: Enabling auto tag policies for governance on GCP folders ensures that resources
  are consistently tagged across the organization, facilitating better resource management,
  cost allocation, and compliance monitoring. This minimizes the risk of unmanaged
  resources and supports regulatory requirements by maintaining clear visibility and
  traceability of resources.
description: This rule checks if auto tag policies are enabled on supported folders
  within GCP's Resource Manager service. Auto tag policies automatically apply labels
  to resources within a folder, helping to enforce organizational tagging standards.
  To verify, inspect the folder's tag policies via the GCP Console under Resource
  Manager settings or use the gcloud CLI. Remediation involves configuring tag policies
  to apply automatically using the 'gcloud resource-manager tags bindings create'
  command.
