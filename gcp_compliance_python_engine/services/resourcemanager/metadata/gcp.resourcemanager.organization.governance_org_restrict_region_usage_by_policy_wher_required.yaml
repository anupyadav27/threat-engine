title: Restrict GCP Region Usage via Organization Policies
rationale: Restricting region usage mitigates risks related to data sovereignty, regulatory
  compliance, and potential data breaches by ensuring data and resources are only
  deployed in approved regions. This control helps organizations avoid legal penalties
  and maintain trust with stakeholders by adhering to geographic data handling requirements.
description: This rule checks if organization policies are in place to restrict usage
  of Google Cloud regions as required by governance standards. The organization must
  configure policies under `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations` to limit the locations
  where resources can be deployed. To verify, review the policy settings in the Google
  Cloud Console under Organization Policy Management. If necessary, update these settings
  to align with compliance mandates and security requirements by defining allowed
  locations.
