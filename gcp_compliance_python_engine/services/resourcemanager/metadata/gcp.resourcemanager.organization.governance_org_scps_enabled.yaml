title: Enable Organization SCPs for Governance Control
rationale: Enabling Organization Service Control Policies (SCPs) is critical for enforcing
  consistent security policies across your Google Cloud organization. Without SCPs,
  individual projects may implement inconsistent policies, increasing the risk of
  misconfigurations and unauthorized access. This is particularly important for meeting
  compliance requirements such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and others that mandate strict access
  and policy controls.
description: This rule checks whether Service Control Policies (SCPs) are enabled
  at the organization level in GCP, ensuring that all projects adhere to predefined
  security and compliance policies. To verify, ensure that SCPs are configured and
  applied to your organization's resources by navigating to the Cloud Console's 'IAM
  & Admin' section and reviewing policy attachments. Remediation involves setting
  up SCPs to enforce necessary security controls across your organization and ensuring
  they are properly applied to all relevant resources.
