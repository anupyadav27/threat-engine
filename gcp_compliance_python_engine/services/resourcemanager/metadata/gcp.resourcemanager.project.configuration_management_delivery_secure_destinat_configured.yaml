title: Ensure Secure Configuration Management Delivery in GCP Projects
rationale: Configuring secure delivery for configuration management in GCP projects
  is critical to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks. Without secure delivery
  methods, sensitive configuration data could be intercepted or tampered with, leading
  to potential security breaches and non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001. Properly securing these deliveries ensures data integrity and confidentiality,
  supporting overall trust in cloud infrastructure.
description: This rule checks whether secure delivery methods, such as HTTPS, are
  configured for configuration management operations in GCP projects. It ensures that
  all configuration data is transmitted securely to prevent interception by unauthorized
  parties. Verification involves reviewing project settings in the Resource Manager
  to confirm the use of secure protocols. Remediation includes updating configuration
  settings to use secure transport mechanisms, such as enabling HTTPS and using encryption
  for data in transit.
