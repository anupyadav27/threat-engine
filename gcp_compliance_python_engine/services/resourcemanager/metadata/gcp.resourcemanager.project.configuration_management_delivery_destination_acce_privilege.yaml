rule_id: gcp.resourcemanager.project.configuration_management_delivery_destination_acce_privilege
service: resourcemanager
resource: project
requirement: Configuration Management Delivery Destination Acce Privilege
scope: resourcemanager.project.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Restrict Access to Configuration Management Destinations
rationale: Misconfigured access privileges to configuration management delivery destinations
  can lead to unauthorized access or data exposure, resulting in potential data breaches
  and non-compliance with regulatory frameworks. Ensuring least privilege access helps
  mitigate insider threats and reduces the attack surface, aligning with compliance
  requirements like NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that access permissions for configuration management
  delivery destinations in GCP projects are set according to the principle of least
  privilege. Verify that IAM roles assigned to users or service accounts have only
  the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Remediation involves auditing
  IAM policies, removing unnecessary roles, and using predefined roles where possible
  to limit access.
