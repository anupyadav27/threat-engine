title: Prevent Public Admin Roles on GCP Projects
rationale: Allowing public access to admin roles on GCP projects poses a significant
  risk of unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches, service disruptions,
  and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS. Such exposure can allow
  malicious actors to escalate privileges, manipulate resources, or exfiltrate sensitive
  information, impacting operational integrity and trust.
description: This rule checks for any public bindings of admin roles within a GCP
  project, ensuring that no user outside the organization is granted administrative
  access. To verify, review the IAM policy bindings for the presence of 'allUsers'
  or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' with roles such as 'roles/owner', 'roles/editor', or
  'roles/admin'. Remediation involves removing these bindings and restricting access
  to trusted identities only, utilizing IAM conditions or VPC Service Controls for
  enhanced security.
