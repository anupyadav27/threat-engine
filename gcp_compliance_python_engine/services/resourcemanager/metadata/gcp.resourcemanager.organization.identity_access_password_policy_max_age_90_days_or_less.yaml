title: Enforce 90-Day Maximum Password Age for GCP IAM Users
rationale: Implementing a maximum password age of 90 days or less helps mitigate the
  risk of unauthorized access due to stale or compromised credentials. Regularly updating
  passwords reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised
  accounts, aligning with compliance standards such as NIST SP 800-53 and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule ensures that the maximum password age for Google Cloud Platform
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) users is configured to 90 days or less. To
  verify, navigate to the GCP Console, access the IAM section, and review the password
  policy settings. Remediation involves setting an organizational policy that enforces
  a password expiration policy of 90 days or less by using the gcloud command-line
  tool or the GCP Console under the 'Security Settings'.
