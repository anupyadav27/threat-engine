severity: low
title: Ensure Mandatory Security Services Are Enabled on Projects
rationale: Enabling mandatory security services on GCP projects reduces the risk of
  unauthorized access and data breaches. It ensures compliance with regulatory standards
  such as PCI-DSS and SOC2, and provides proactive monitoring capabilities to detect
  and respond to potential threats efficiently.
description: This rule checks if mandatory security services, such as Security Command
  Center and Cloud Audit Logs, are enabled on GCP projects. Enabling these services
  allows for continuous security monitoring and logging of user activities and configurations.
  To verify, ensure that Security Command Center is set to at least 'Standard' tier,
  and that Cloud Audit Logs are configured to capture Admin Activity and Data Access
  logs. Remediation involves activating these services via the GCP Console or gcloud
  CLI.
