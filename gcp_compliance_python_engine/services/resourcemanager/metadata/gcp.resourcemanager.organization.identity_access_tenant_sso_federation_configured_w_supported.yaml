title: Ensure SSO Federation is Configured for Identity Access Tenant
rationale: Configuring SSO federation for your organization's identity access tenant
  enhances security by centralizing user authentication and reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access. It ensures compliance with industry standards by allowing integration with
  established identity providers, thus mitigating potential security breaches and
  protecting sensitive organizational data.
description: This rule checks that Single Sign-On (SSO) federation is configured for
  your GCP organization's identity access tenant, ensuring that only authorized identity
  providers can authenticate users. To verify, review the IAM settings in the GCP
  Console under Security > Identity and Access Management, confirming that SSO is
  enabled with supported providers. Remediation involves setting up a federation with
  a trusted identity provider, following GCP's guidelines to ensure proper configuration
  and security.
