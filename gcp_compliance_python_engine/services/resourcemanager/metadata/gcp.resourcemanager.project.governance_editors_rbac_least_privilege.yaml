rule_id: gcp.resourcemanager.project.governance_editors_rbac_least_privilege
service: resourcemanager
resource: project
requirement: Governance Editors RBAC Least Privilege
scope: resourcemanager.project.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Limit Editor Role Use to Minimize Security Risks
rationale: Excessive permissions can lead to unintended access, increasing the risk
  of data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and
  HIPAA. By ensuring that governance editors have only the necessary permissions,
  organizations can mitigate insider threats and prevent misuse of sensitive resources,
  thus protecting business-critical operations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks for the assignment of the 'Editor' role within GCP projects
  to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege. It identifies accounts
  with more permissions than necessary, which could lead to excessive access to project
  resources. Remediation involves reviewing and adjusting IAM policies to assign only
  the necessary roles and permissions, using custom roles if necessary to precisely
  tailor access rights. Verification can be done through the IAM policy analysis tool
  in the GCP console or by using `gcloud` commands to list and audit current role
  assignments.
