title: Ensure Required Configuration Management Rules in Projects
rationale: Having required configuration management rules ensures that project resources
  are consistently and securely configured, reducing the risk of misconfigurations
  that can lead to data breaches or non-compliance with industry standards. This is
  crucial for maintaining a secure cloud environment and meeting regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for the presence of essential configuration management
  rules within a GCP project. It ensures that projects adhere to predefined security
  configurations, thereby enforcing best practices for secure instance deployment.
  To verify compliance, audit your project's resource configurations against the set
  rules and apply any missing rules using configuration management tools like Terraform
  or Deployment Manager. Remediation involves defining and implementing missing rules
  to align with organizational security policies.
