title: Ensure Compliance Policies Attached to GCP Folders
rationale: Attaching Security Control Policies (SCPs) to GCP folders helps enforce
  organizational governance, ensuring folders adhere to defined security and compliance
  policies. This prevents unauthorized actions and misconfigurations that could lead
  to data breaches or non-compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS or SOC2.
description: This rule checks if all GCP folders have appropriate SCPs attached, ensuring
  that organizational policies are enforced consistently. Verify by navigating to
  the GCP Console under 'IAM & Admin' > 'Folders' and checking for attached policies.
  Remediation involves creating and attaching SCPs that align with your organization's
  security and compliance requirements.
