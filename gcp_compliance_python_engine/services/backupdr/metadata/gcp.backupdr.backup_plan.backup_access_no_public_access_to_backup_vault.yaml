service: backupdr
resource: backup_plan
requirement: Backup Access No Public Access To Backup Vault
scope: backupdr.backup_plan.backup_recovery
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: critical
title: Restrict Public Access to Backup Vaults in GCP
rationale: Public access to backup vaults can lead to unauthorized data exposure and
  potential data breaches. This poses significant risks to business continuity and
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Threat actors
  could exploit publicly accessible backups to extract sensitive information or disrupt
  recovery processes.
description: This rule checks that backup vaults in GCP's Backup and DR service are
  not publicly accessible. Verify that IAM policies do not grant 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
  roles on backup vault resources. Remediation involves adjusting IAM policies to
  restrict access to only trusted identities and roles, ensuring that backup data
  remains secure and accessible only to authorized personnel.
