title: Configure Alert Rules for Backup Job Failures
rationale: Configuring backup monitoring alert rules is crucial for ensuring data
  resilience and integrity. Without timely alerts on backup job failures, organizations
  risk data loss, impacting business continuity and compliance with data protection
  regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Early detection of backup failures helps mitigate
  risks associated with data breaches and operational disruptions.
description: This rule checks if alerting rules are configured for monitoring backup
  job failures in Google Cloud Backup and DR service. It ensures that alerts are set
  up to notify administrators of any failed backup operations, enabling prompt investigation
  and remediation. To verify, access the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Monitoring,
  and ensure that alerting policies are defined for backup job statuses. Remediation
  involves creating alerting policies that target backup job failure logs and configuring
  notification channels.
