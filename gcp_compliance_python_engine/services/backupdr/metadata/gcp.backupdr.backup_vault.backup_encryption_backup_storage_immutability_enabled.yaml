title: Ensure Backup Storage Immutability and Encryption
rationale: Enabling encryption and immutability for backup storage ensures that sensitive
  data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and ransomware attacks. This measure is critical for maintaining data integrity
  and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate protection
  of personal and sensitive information.
description: This rule checks that backup storage within the Google Cloud Backup and
  DR service is configured with encryption and immutability. Encryption at rest protects
  data by making it unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys, while immutability
  ensures that backups cannot be modified or deleted within a specified timeframe.
  Verify these settings in the GCP Console under Backup and DR policies, and enable
  encryption and immutability in the backup settings to comply with best practices
  and regulatory standards.
