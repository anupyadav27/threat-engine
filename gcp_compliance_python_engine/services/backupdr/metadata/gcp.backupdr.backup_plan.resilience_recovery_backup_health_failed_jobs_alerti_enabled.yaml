title: Enable Alerting for Failed Backup Jobs in Backup Plans
rationale: Alerting on failed backup jobs is crucial to ensure that data recovery
  processes are operational and reliable. Without timely alerts, failed backups could
  go unnoticed, potentially leading to data loss and impacting business continuity.
  This is especially critical in industries with stringent data protection regulations,
  where data availability and integrity are mandated.
description: This rule checks whether alerting is enabled for failed backup jobs within
  Google Cloud Backup and DR backup plans. It verifies that notifications are configured
  to alert administrators in case of backup failures, allowing for prompt investigation
  and remediation. Administrators should ensure that alerting is enabled by configuring
  appropriate monitoring and notification settings in the Google Cloud Console. Remediation
  involves setting up Cloud Monitoring alerts to track backup job statuses and configuring
  notification channels for alert delivery.
