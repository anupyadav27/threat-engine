title: Ensure MFA for Backup Admins Accessing Backup Plans
rationale: Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for backup administrators helps
  mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to backup plans, reducing potential data
  breaches and ensuring data integrity. This practice is crucial for maintaining compliance
  with regulations such as NIST SP 800-63B, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001, which emphasize
  strong authentication mechanisms.
description: This rule verifies that all accounts with administrative access to GCP
  Backup and DR backup plans have MFA enabled. To ensure compliance, verify that IAM
  policies enforce MFA for roles with backup admin privileges. Remediation involves
  configuring IAM policy bindings to require MFA and ensuring that all backup admin
  accounts are enrolled in an MFA program. Regularly audit IAM roles and policies
  to confirm ongoing compliance.
