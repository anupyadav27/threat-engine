title: Ensure Recovery Point Retention is Configured for Backup Plans
rationale: Configuring recovery point retention ensures that backup data is available
  for restoration when needed, minimizing data loss in disaster scenarios. This is
  crucial for meeting business continuity requirements and compliance obligations,
  such as data retention policies mandated by regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if recovery point retention is configured for GCP Backup
  and DR backup plans. To verify, inspect the backup plan settings in the GCP Console
  under Backup and DR, ensuring that a retention policy is specified. Remediation
  involves setting a retention period based on business needs and compliance requirements,
  using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to adjust settings as necessary.
