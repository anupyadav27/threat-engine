subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Ensure Backup Plan Alert Destinations Are Configured
rationale: Configuring alert destinations for backup plans is crucial for timely notifications
  about backup failures or issues. Without proper alerting, organizations risk data
  loss due to unmonitored backup failures, which can lead to business disruptions,
  financial loss, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether alert destinations are configured for GCP backup
  plans. Proper configuration ensures that alerts are sent to designated personnel
  or systems whenever a backup operation fails or encounters issues. To verify, navigate
  to the Backup and DR service in the GCP Console, select the backup plan, and review
  the alert configurations under monitoring settings. Remediation includes setting
  up alert policies in Cloud Monitoring to notify stakeholders via email, SMS, or
  webhook.
