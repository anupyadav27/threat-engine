rule_id: gcp.backupdr.backup_vault.backup_encryption_key_policy_least_privilege
service: backupdr
resource: backup_vault
requirement: Backup Encryption Key Policy Least Privilege
scope: backupdr.backup_vault.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Backup Vault Encryption Key Policy
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to encryption key policies mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access to backup vaults, preventing data breaches and ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations. Limiting access reduces the potential
  attack surface, protecting sensitive data from malicious insiders or external threats.
description: This rule checks whether the encryption key policy for backup vaults
  adheres to the principle of least privilege by ensuring only authorized users and
  services have access. Review IAM roles and permissions associated with the encryption
  keys to confirm that they are restricted to necessary personnel. Remediation involves
  auditing current permissions, removing unnecessary access, and aligning with organizational
  security policies.
