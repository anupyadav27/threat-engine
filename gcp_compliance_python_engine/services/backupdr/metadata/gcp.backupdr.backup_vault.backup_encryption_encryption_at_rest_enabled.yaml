resource: backup_vault
requirement: Backup Encryption Encryption At Rest Enabled
scope: backupdr.backup_vault.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Backup Vaults Are Encrypted At Rest
rationale: Encrypting backups at rest is critical to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. It ensures compliance with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection measures. In the event of
  physical theft or unauthorized access to storage media, encryption at rest mitigates
  the risk of data compromise.
description: This rule verifies that all backup vaults within the Backup and DR service
  have encryption at rest enabled. This is accomplished by checking the configuration
  settings of backup vaults to ensure that the 'encryption' property is set to 'true'.
  To remediate, ensure that encryption is enabled during the creation of backup vaults
  or by modifying existing vault settings. Regular audits should be conducted to maintain
  compliance.
