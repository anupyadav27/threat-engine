domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure Backup Health by Monitoring Last Backup Recency
rationale: Timely and regular backups are crucial for maintaining business continuity
  and minimizing data loss in disaster recovery scenarios. Delayed or irregular backups
  can lead to significant risks, including data unavailability, potential non-compliance
  with data retention policies, and increased vulnerability to data loss from unforeseen
  incidents.
description: This rule checks the recency of the last successful backup in the GCP
  Backup and DR service. It ensures that backup plans for critical resources are regularly
  executed within a specified number of days. To verify, access the Backup and DR
  dashboard and review the 'Last Backup' timestamp. Remediate by scheduling regular
  backups and configuring alerts for backup failures or delays to ensure compliance
  with organizational resilience policies.
