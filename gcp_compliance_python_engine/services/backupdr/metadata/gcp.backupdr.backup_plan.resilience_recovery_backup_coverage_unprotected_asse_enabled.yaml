title: Ensure Backup Coverage for All Critical Assets in GCP Backup Plan
rationale: Ensuring all critical assets are covered in backup plans enhances resilience
  by minimizing data loss and reducing downtime during disasters. Unprotected assets
  can lead to significant business impacts, including financial losses and operational
  disruptions. Compliance with standards like ISO 27001 and NIST requires comprehensive
  backup strategies, thus protecting the organization's reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule checks that all critical assets are included in a GCP backup
  plan to ensure resilience and recovery capabilities. Verify that backup plans are
  configured to include all necessary resources by reviewing backup plan policies
  and settings in the GCP Console. Remediation involves identifying any unprotected
  assets and updating the backup plan to incorporate these resources, ensuring alignment
  with organizational recovery objectives.
