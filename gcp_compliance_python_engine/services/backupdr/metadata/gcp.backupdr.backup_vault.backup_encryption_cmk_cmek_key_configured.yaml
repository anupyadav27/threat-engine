title: Ensure Backup Vaults Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
rationale: Encrypting backup data with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) strengthens
  data protection by providing customers with control over encryption keys. This enhances
  security against unauthorized access and aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring that sensitive data remains encrypted and under
  customer control.
description: This rule checks whether backup vaults in GCP Backup and DR Service are
  configured to use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting data at
  rest. To verify, examine the backup vault settings in the Google Cloud Console or
  use gcloud commands to ensure a CMEK is specified. Remediation involves configuring
  the backup vault to use a CMEK by assigning a Google Cloud Key Management Service
  (KMS) key to the vault settings, thereby enhancing data protection.
