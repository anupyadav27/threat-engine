title: Ensure Backup Vault Access Follows Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Backup Vault access helps prevent unauthorized
  data access and potential data breaches. It minimizes the risk of insider threats
  and limits the impact of compromised accounts. Adhering to least privilege is crucial
  for compliance with standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, which mandate
  strict access controls.
description: This rule checks if backup plans in GCP Backup and DR service implement
  RBAC policies that adhere to the least privilege principle. It verifies that users
  and service accounts have only the necessary permissions to perform their roles.
  Remediation involves auditing current IAM roles associated with backup plans and
  adjusting permissions to ensure minimal necessary access. Verify configurations
  in the IAM section of the Google Cloud Console and adjust roles as needed to comply
  with best practices.
