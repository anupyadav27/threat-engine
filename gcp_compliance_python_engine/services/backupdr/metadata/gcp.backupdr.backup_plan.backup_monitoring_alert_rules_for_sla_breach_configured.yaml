severity: medium
title: Configure SLA Breach Alerts for Backup Plans
rationale: Configuring SLA breach alerts for backup plans is crucial to ensure timely
  responses to potential data loss incidents, minimizing downtime and protecting business
  continuity. Failure to respond promptly to SLA breaches can result in data integrity
  issues, financial losses, and potential non-compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that Google Cloud Backup and DR (backupdr) service has
  monitoring and alerting rules configured to notify stakeholders when a Service Level
  Agreement (SLA) breach occurs. To verify, ensure that alert policies are set up
  in Cloud Monitoring to track backup operations status and trigger notifications
  when SLAs are not met. Remediation involves setting up specific alert policies via
  Google Cloud Console or using Terraform scripts to automate alert configurations.
