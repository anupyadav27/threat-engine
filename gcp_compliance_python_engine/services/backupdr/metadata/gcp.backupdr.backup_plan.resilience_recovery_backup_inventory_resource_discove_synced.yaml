title: Ensure Backup Inventory Resource Discovery is Synced
rationale: Maintaining an up-to-date and accurate backup inventory is crucial for
  effective disaster recovery and business continuity planning. Unsynced or outdated
  resource inventories can lead to incomplete or ineffective recovery processes, potentially
  resulting in data loss, increased downtime, and non-compliance with industry regulations
  such as ISO 27001 or SOC2.
description: This check verifies that the resource discovery for backup inventory
  within the backup plan is consistently synced. A correctly synchronized backup inventory
  ensures that all resources are accounted for in the event of a disaster recovery
  operation. To verify, ensure the backup plan settings include automatic synchronization
  of resource discovery and regularly audit the sync status. Remediation involves
  configuring the backup plan to enable regular sync operations and monitoring for
  any sync failures.
