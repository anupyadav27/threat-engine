subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure Backup Plan Job Success Rate Meets Minimum Threshold
rationale: Achieving a high success rate in backup jobs is crucial for ensuring data
  resilience and availability during disasters. A low success rate can lead to incomplete
  or unsuccessful data recovery, posing business continuity risks. Regulatory frameworks
  often mandate robust backup and recovery plans to protect sensitive data and maintain
  compliance.
description: This rule verifies that the success rate of backup health jobs within
  a GCP Backup and Disaster Recovery (backupdr) plan meets or exceeds a specified
  minimum threshold. It checks the backup plan configurations to ensure that backups
  are consistently successful, identifying frequent failures that require attention.
  To remediate, review backup configurations, analyze failure logs, and adjust settings
  or resources to improve reliability. Regular monitoring and testing of backup operations
  are recommended to maintain compliance with resilience standards.
