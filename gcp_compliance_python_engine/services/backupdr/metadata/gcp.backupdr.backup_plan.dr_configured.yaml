title: Ensure Backup Plans Have Disaster Recovery Configured
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) for backup plans is crucial to minimize
  data loss and ensure business continuity in the event of an incident. Without a
  proper DR strategy, organizations are at risk of prolonged downtime and potential
  non-compliance with industry regulations such as ISO 27001 or SOC2, which could
  lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if disaster recovery configurations are in place for
  Google Cloud backup plans. Specifically, it verifies that the backup plans include
  settings for cross-region replication and regular DR testing. To verify, review
  your backup plans in the Google Cloud Console under 'Backup & DR' to ensure DR configurations
  are active. To remediate, enable cross-region replication and schedule regular DR
  drills to ensure data resilience across geographic locations.
