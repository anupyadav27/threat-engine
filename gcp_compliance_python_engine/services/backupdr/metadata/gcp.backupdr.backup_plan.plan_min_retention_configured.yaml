title: Ensure Backup Plan Minimum Retention Period is Configured
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for backup plans ensures that data
  is retained for a sufficient time to recover from data loss incidents, supporting
  business continuity and compliance with data retention policies. Without a defined
  retention period, critical data might be prematurely deleted, increasing the risk
  of data loss and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether a minimum retention period is set for each backup
  plan in GCP's Backup for DR service. To verify, ensure that each backup plan has
  the 'minimum retention period' parameter configured according to your organization's
  data retention policy. Failure to configure this setting could result in insufficient
  data availability for recovery. To remediate, access the GCP Console, navigate to
  Backup for DR, and set the 'minimum retention period' for each backup plan based
  on organizational or regulatory requirements.
