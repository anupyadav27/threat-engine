subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege Access to Backup Keys in Backup Plans
rationale: Limiting access to backup keys is crucial to prevent unauthorized data
  retrieval, which could lead to data breaches or loss. Ensuring least privilege access
  aligns with best practices for data protection and is essential for meeting compliance
  standards such as ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS, which mandate stringent access controls
  to sensitive information.
description: This rule checks that access to backup keys within GCP Backup and Disaster
  Recovery (backupdr) backup plans is restricted to only those identities that absolutely
  need it. Verify that IAM roles associated with backup keys are set to the minimum
  scope necessary by reviewing and adjusting IAM policies. Remediation involves auditing
  current access and revoking unnecessary permissions, ensuring only authorized personnel
  have access to these critical resources.
