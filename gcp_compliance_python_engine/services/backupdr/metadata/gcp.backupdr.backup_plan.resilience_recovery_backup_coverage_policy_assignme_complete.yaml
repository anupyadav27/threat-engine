domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure Complete Backup Coverage in Backup Plan
rationale: Complete backup coverage is critical for ensuring that all crucial data
  can be recovered in the event of a disaster. Incomplete backup assignments can lead
  to significant data loss, disrupt business operations, and potentially violate regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA. Ensuring thorough backup coverage mitigates
  risks related to data breaches and operational downtime.
description: This rule checks if all necessary resources are included in the backup
  plan to ensure full recovery capability. It verifies that the resilience recovery
  backup coverage policy is assigned to all relevant backup plans. To remediate, review
  your backup plans and confirm that all critical resources are included. Utilize
  the GCP Console or gcloud commands to update and assign policies where necessary.
