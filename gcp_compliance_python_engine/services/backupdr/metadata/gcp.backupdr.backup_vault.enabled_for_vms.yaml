title: Ensure Backup Vaults are Enabled for VMs in GCP
rationale: Enabling backup vaults for virtual machines (VMs) in GCP is critical for
  ensuring data resilience and disaster recovery. In the event of data loss or corruption,
  having backups allows for quick restoration, minimizing downtime and potential revenue
  loss. This practice also supports compliance with regulatory frameworks that mandate
  data integrity and availability, such as ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if backup vaults are configured and enabled for virtual
  machines within the GCP environment. Ensuring that backup vaults are operational
  involves verifying that backup policies are correctly applied to VMs and that the
  backups are regularly scheduled. Remediation involves configuring the backup vault
  through the GCP Console or command-line interface to include all necessary VMs and
  setting appropriate backup schedules to meet organizational recovery objectives.
