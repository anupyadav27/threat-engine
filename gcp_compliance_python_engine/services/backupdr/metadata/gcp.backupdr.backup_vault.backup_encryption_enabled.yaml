severity: high
title: Ensure Backup Vault Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption for backup vaults in GCP ensures that sensitive data
  is protected against unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and
  ensuring compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
  Without encryption, backups are vulnerable to unauthorized access, which could lead
  to data leaks and significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for backup vaults in the
  GCP Backup and Disaster Recovery service. Encryption at rest should be enabled to
  protect backup data from unauthorized access. To verify, navigate to the Backup
  and Disaster Recovery settings in the GCP Console and ensure that encryption settings
  are configured. Remediation involves enabling Google-managed or customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) for backup vaults.
