title: Ensure Backup Vault Uses TLS 1.2+ for In-Transit Encryption
rationale: Utilizing TLS version 1.2 or higher for data in transit within Backup Vaults
  is crucial to protect sensitive data against interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This practice helps avoid potential data breaches and aligns with compliance
  frameworks like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strong encryption standards to
  safeguard customer information.
description: This rule checks that Google Cloud's Backup Vault service is configured
  to use TLS version 1.2 or higher for encrypting data in transit. To verify compliance,
  ensure that all backup configurations use the appropriate encryption settings as
  specified in the GCP console under Backup settings. Remediation involves updating
  the configurations to enforce the use of TLS 1.2 or later, thereby enhancing the
  security posture of your backup data.
