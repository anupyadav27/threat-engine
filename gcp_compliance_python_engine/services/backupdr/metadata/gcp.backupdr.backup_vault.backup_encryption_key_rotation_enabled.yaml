title: Ensure Backup Vault Encryption Key Rotation is Enabled
rationale: Regular rotation of encryption keys for backup vaults is crucial to mitigate
  the risk of unauthorized data access and to adhere to data protection regulations.
  Frequent key rotation reduces the potential impact of key compromise, ensuring that
  encrypted data remains secure over time. It is also a requirement for compliance
  with several data protection standards, providing a safeguard against evolving security
  threats.
description: This rule checks whether the encryption keys for Google Cloud Backup
  Vaults are configured to rotate automatically. To verify, ensure that the key rotation
  schedule is set in the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) for the keys associated
  with your backup vaults. Remediation involves configuring automatic key rotation
  in KMS and setting an appropriate rotation period, such as every 90 days, to enhance
  data security and compliance.
