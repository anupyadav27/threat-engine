title: Enforce Least Privilege for Dataproc Cluster Admin Access
rationale: Ensuring least privilege in Dataproc clusters minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  data access and potential data breaches. Improperly assigned admin rights can lead
  to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive data, posing significant
  business and regulatory compliance risks, including violation of GDPR or HIPAA standards.
description: This rule checks that the Data Analytics Admin role in Dataproc clusters
  is assigned only to users who absolutely need it. Verify that IAM policies on the
  cluster restrict admin access to essential personnel by reviewing IAM roles and
  permissions. If admin access is overly permissive, adjust the IAM policy to remove
  unnecessary permissions and apply the principle of least privilege by assigning
  only essential roles. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance.
