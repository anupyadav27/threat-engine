title: Ensure Dataproc Jobs Use Private Networks Only
rationale: Using private networks for Dataproc jobs minimizes exposure to unauthorized
  access, reduces the risk of data breaches, and complies with regulatory requirements
  for data protection. By restricting Dataproc jobs to private networks, organizations
  can mitigate risks associated with public internet exposure, such as man-in-the-middle
  attacks and unauthorized data interception.
description: This rule checks that Dataproc jobs are configured to run on private
  IP networks only. To verify, ensure that the Dataproc cluster's network configuration
  specifies a subnet that does not have 'Private Google Access' enabled. Remediation
  involves updating the cluster's network settings to restrict traffic to internal
  IP addresses, thus preventing public internet exposure.
