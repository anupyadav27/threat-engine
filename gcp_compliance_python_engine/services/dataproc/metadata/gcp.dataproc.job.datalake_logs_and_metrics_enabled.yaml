title: Enable Logging and Metrics for Dataproc Jobs
rationale: Enabling logs and metrics for Dataproc jobs is crucial for monitoring and
  auditing data processing activities. It helps detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues,
  and maintain compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which require detailed
  logging of data access and processing activities. Without these logs, organizations
  risk undetected data breaches and non-compliance penalties.
description: This rule checks if logging and metrics are enabled for Dataproc jobs.
  To verify compliance, ensure that Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring are configured
  for each Dataproc job. This involves enabling the 'Google Cloud's operations suite'
  in your project settings and ensuring that job submissions include logging configurations.
  If not enabled, update your Dataproc job configurations to include the necessary
  logging and monitoring settings for comprehensive audit trails and performance insights.
