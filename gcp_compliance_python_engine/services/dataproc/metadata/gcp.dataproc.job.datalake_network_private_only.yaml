title: Ensure Dataproc Jobs Use Private Networks Only
rationale: Restricting Dataproc jobs to private networks mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and data exfiltration by ensuring that jobs cannot be accessed from the public
  internet. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
  data processed in Dataproc, and helps organizations comply with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA by enforcing network access control.
description: This rule verifies that Dataproc jobs are configured to use only private
  networks by checking the network settings of each job. To ensure compliance, configure
  the Dataproc cluster's network to be private and specify the same network for all
  jobs. Remediate by reviewing Dataproc network configurations and updating jobs to
  run on private IP-only subnets, thus preventing exposure to public networks.
