title: Restrict Datalake Trigger Event Sources in Dataproc Jobs
rationale: Restricting event sources for Dataproc jobs helps mitigate unauthorized
  data processing and access, reducing the risk of data leaks and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. By controlling event sources,
  organizations can prevent accidental or malicious triggers that could exploit sensitive
  data within their data lakes.
description: This rule checks whether Dataproc jobs have restricted trigger event
  sources to prevent unauthorized or unintended job executions. Ensure that Dataproc
  jobs are configured to only accept events from trusted and verified sources, such
  as specific Cloud Pub/Sub topics or GCS buckets. Review and configure event sources
  in the Dataproc job settings to align with organizational security policies. Remediation
  involves updating access permissions and configurations to limit event triggers
  to authorized sources only.
