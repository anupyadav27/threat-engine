title: Enable Dataproc Job Datalake ML Transform Logs
rationale: Enabling logs for Datalake ML Transform jobs in Dataproc allows for auditability
  and traceability of data transformations, which is crucial for identifying unauthorized
  access or modifications. This enhances the security posture by providing visibility
  into operations, aiding in compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, and ensuring data integrity.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for Datalake ML Transform jobs
  in Google Cloud Dataproc. To verify, ensure that the jobs have logging configurations
  set to capture logs in a designated storage bucket. Remediation involves configuring
  the Dataproc jobs to enable logging by setting the `driver-log-levels` parameter
  to an appropriate level and specifying a logging destination, such as Google Cloud
  Storage or Stackdriver Logging.
