title: Enable Dataproc Job Trigger Logs for Audit Monitoring
rationale: Enabling logs for Dataproc job triggers is crucial for auditing and monitoring
  data access patterns, which helps identify unauthorized access attempts and misconfigurations.
  This enhances the security posture by ensuring traceability of data operations,
  essential for meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks that logging is enabled for all Dataproc jobs to capture
  trigger events. To verify, ensure that logging is activated in the Dataproc cluster
  configuration settings under 'Job History'. Remediation involves updating the cluster
  configuration to enable logging, thus providing a detailed audit trail for data
  processing activities.
