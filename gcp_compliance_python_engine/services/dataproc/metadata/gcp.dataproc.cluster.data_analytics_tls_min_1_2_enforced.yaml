title: Enforce TLS 1.2 for Dataproc Cluster Data Analytics
rationale: Enforcing a minimum of TLS 1.2 for Dataproc clusters ensures that data
  in transit is protected against interception and tampering. This is crucial for
  maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially when handling sensitive
  data. It reduces the risk of data breaches through exploitation of older, less secure
  protocols and aligns with compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which
  mandate strong encryption standards.
description: This rule verifies that all Dataproc clusters are configured to enforce
  a minimum of TLS 1.2 for data analytics, ensuring secure communication channels.
  To check compliance, verify the cluster's configuration in the Google Cloud Console
  or via the gcloud CLI, ensuring that the cluster's properties enforce TLS 1.2. Remediation
  involves updating cluster configurations to disable older protocols and enforce
  TLS 1.2 or higher, which can be done by modifying the cluster's security settings.
