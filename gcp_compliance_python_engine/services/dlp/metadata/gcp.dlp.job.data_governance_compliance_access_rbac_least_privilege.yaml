title: Ensure DLP Job RBAC Follows Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for DLP jobs is critical to minimize
  unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. Inadequate access controls
  can lead to misuse of sensitive information, regulatory non-compliance, and potential
  financial and reputational damage. Least privilege access ensures that users and
  services have only the permissions necessary for their functions, reducing the attack
  surface.
description: This rule checks if DLP jobs in GCP adhere to the principle of least
  privilege by ensuring that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations are properly
  set. Specifically, it verifies that only necessary permissions are assigned to users
  and service accounts interacting with DLP jobs. To remediate, review IAM policies
  and restrict permissions to only those required for job execution. Use the Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to audit and adjust IAM roles, ensuring compliance with
  data governance policies.
