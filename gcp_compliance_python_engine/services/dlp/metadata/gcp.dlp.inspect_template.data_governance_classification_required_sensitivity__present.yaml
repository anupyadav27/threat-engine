subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DLP Inspector Templates Classify Sensitive Data
rationale: Proper classification of sensitive data is crucial for maintaining data
  privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Without appropriate
  sensitivity levels in DLP inspector templates, sensitive data might be inadequately
  protected, leading to potential data breaches and financial penalties. Ensuring
  data governance classifications are present helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  data access and misuse.
description: This rule checks that all DLP inspector templates in use have defined
  data governance classifications with the required sensitivity levels. Verify that
  each template includes sensitivity annotations to classify data types such as PII
  or financial information. To remediate, review and update DLP inspector templates
  to include accurate sensitivity labels, ensuring they align with your organization's
  data protection policies and regulatory requirements.
