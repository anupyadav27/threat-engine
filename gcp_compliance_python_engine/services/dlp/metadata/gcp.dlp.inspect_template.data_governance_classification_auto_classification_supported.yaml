title: Enable Auto Classification in DLP Inspect Templates
rationale: Automatic data classification enhances data governance by ensuring sensitive
  information is consistently identified and protected, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and aiding in regulatory compliance such as GDPR and CCPA. Failure to utilize
  automated classification can result in unintentional exposure of sensitive data,
  financial penalties, and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud DLP inspect templates are configured
  to support automatic data classification, which classifies data using predefined
  or custom info types. To verify, ensure the inspect template has auto classification
  enabled. Remediation involves updating the template configuration to include auto
  classification settings, aligning with your organizational data protection policies.
