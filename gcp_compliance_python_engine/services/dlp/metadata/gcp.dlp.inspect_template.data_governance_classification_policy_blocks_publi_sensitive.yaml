requirement: Data Governance Classification Policy Blocks Publi Sensitive
scope: dlp.inspect_template.policy_management
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DLP Templates Enforce Publi Sensitive Data Classification
rationale: Blocking the exposure of sensitive data classified under data governance
  policies is crucial to avoid data breaches, potential financial losses, and compliance
  violations. This helps organizations maintain trust with customers by ensuring sensitive
  data is protected and adheres to privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Mismanagement
  of such data can lead to severe penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether Data Loss Prevention (DLP) inspect templates
  in GCP are configured to enforce data governance classification policies for public
  sensitive data. It verifies that inspect templates block or redact sensitive data,
  mitigating unauthorized access risks. To remediate, update the inspect templates
  to include classification rules aligned with your data governance policies, ensuring
  sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed.
