title: Enforce Least Privilege for DLP Privacy Masking Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for DLP privacy masking roles is crucial to
  minimize the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Over-permissioned
  roles can lead to exposure of sensitive information, which can result in regulatory
  non-compliance and damage to the organization's reputation. Ensuring that roles
  have only the necessary permissions helps mitigate insider threats and meets compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the principle of least privilege in
  assigning roles for DLP privacy masking jobs. Ensure that only necessary permissions
  are granted to roles involved in executing DLP jobs by reviewing IAM policies and
  removing any excessive permissions. To verify compliance, audit current IAM roles
  and permissions associated with DLP jobs, and adjust them to meet the minimum required
  for task execution. Remediate by using predefined roles with the least privilege
  or custom roles tailored to specific job needs.
