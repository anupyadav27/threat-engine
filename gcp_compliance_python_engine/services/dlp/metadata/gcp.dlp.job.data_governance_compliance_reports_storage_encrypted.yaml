title: Ensure DLP Job Reports are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest for DLP job reports is crucial to protect sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice
  supports compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, mitigating
  risks of financial penalties and reputational damage. Encryption at rest also helps
  safeguard against insider threats and physical theft of storage media.
description: This rule checks whether Data Loss Prevention (DLP) job reports are encrypted
  when stored in Google Cloud Storage. To verify compliance, ensure that Cloud Storage
  buckets used for storing DLP job outputs have default encryption enabled, either
  using Google-managed keys or customer-managed keys (CMEK). If encryption is not
  enabled, configure the bucket settings to apply encryption for all stored objects.
  This can be done through the GCP Console, gcloud CLI, or Cloud Storage JSON API.
