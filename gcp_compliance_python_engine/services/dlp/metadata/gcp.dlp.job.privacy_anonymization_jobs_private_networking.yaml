title: Ensure DLP Anonymization Jobs Use Private Networking
rationale: Configuring DLP anonymization jobs to use private networking minimizes
  exposure to public internet threats, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  access. It supports compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA
  by ensuring sensitive data is processed in a secure environment. This setup enhances
  the security posture by restricting network access to authorized entities only.
description: This rule checks that Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) anonymization
  jobs are configured to use private networking, such as VPC Service Controls or Private
  Google Access. Verify that the DLP jobs have network policies enforcing private
  IP usage to ensure that data does not transit over the public internet. To remediate,
  configure VPC Service Controls and ensure that all DLP jobs are set to use private
  IPs, limiting network exposure and enhancing security.
