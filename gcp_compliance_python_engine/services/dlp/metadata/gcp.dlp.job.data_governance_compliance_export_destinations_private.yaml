title: Ensure DLP Job Export Destinations are Private
rationale: Ensuring that Data Loss Prevention (DLP) job export destinations are private
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and leakage, protecting sensitive
  information from exposure. This practice supports compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, preventing potential breaches and financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that DLP job export destinations are configured to
  use private networking, ensuring data is not exposed to public internet access.
  Specifically, it checks if the export destinations, such as Cloud Storage buckets,
  are set with private IP addresses or reside within a VPC. To remediate, configure
  the export destination to use private IPs or set appropriate network policies to
  restrict public access. Validate through the GCP Console by checking network settings
  associated with the DLP job.
