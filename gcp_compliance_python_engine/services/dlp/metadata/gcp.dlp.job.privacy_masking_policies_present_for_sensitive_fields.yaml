title: Ensure Privacy Masking for Sensitive Data in DLP Jobs
rationale: Implementing privacy masking policies for sensitive fields in DLP jobs
  is crucial to protect confidential information from unauthorized access and data
  breaches. Without proper masking, sensitive data may be exposed during processing,
  leading to potential legal liabilities and non-compliance with frameworks like GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Effective masking reduces the risk of data exposure, thereby
  safeguarding organizational reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether privacy masking policies are implemented for
  sensitive fields in DLP jobs. It ensures that any sensitive data identified during
  a DLP job is appropriately masked according to predefined policies. To verify, review
  the DLP job configurations within the GCP Console for presence of masking configurations
  on sensitive fields. Remediation involves defining and applying masking policies
  for all identified sensitive fields using GCP's Data Loss Prevention API or DLP
  templates.
