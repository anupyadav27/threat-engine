title: Ensure DLP Job Outputs are Encrypted for Privacy
rationale: Encrypting outputs of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) jobs is crucial to protect
  sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Anonymization outputs, if left unencrypted, can
  be vulnerable to breaches, potentially leading to data leaks and significant financial
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all privacy anonymization outputs from DLP jobs
  within Google Cloud are encrypted. To ensure compliance, configure DLP jobs to use
  Cloud KMS for encryption. This can be checked through the DLP settings in the GCP
  Console or by using gcloud commands. If outputs are not encrypted, adjust the DLP
  job configuration to specify an appropriate encryption key.
