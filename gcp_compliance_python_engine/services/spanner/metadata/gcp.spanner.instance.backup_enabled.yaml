title: Ensure Backup is Enabled for Spanner Instances
rationale: Enabling backups for Cloud Spanner instances is crucial for data resilience
  and disaster recovery. Without regular backups, data loss can occur due to accidental
  deletions, corruption, or incidents like system failures, affecting business continuity
  and potentially leading to significant financial impacts. Compliance with standards
  such as ISO 27001 and SOC2 often requires effective backup strategies to protect
  sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud Spanner instances have automated backups
  enabled. To verify, ensure that each Spanner instance has a backup schedule configured
  in the GCP Console or through the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves
  setting up automated backups using the 'gcloud spanner backups create' command or
  through the GCP Console by navigating to the Spanner instance settings and configuring
  a backup schedule.
