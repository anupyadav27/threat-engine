requirement: Stream Ingestion Auth Required

severity: low
title: Ensure Authenticated Access for Logging Sink Streaming
rationale: Authenticated access to logging sinks is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  data ingestion, which could lead to data leakage or manipulation, compromising the
  integrity of audit logs. Ensuring authentication aligns with compliance mandates
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, reducing the risk of exposure to malicious activities
  and regulatory penalties.
description: This rule checks that all logging sinks configured for streaming ingestion
  require authenticated access. It verifies that IAM policies are set to enforce identity
  verification for any entity attempting to write logs. To remediate, review the IAM
  permissions for the logging sink and ensure that only authorized identities can
  access it. Modify the IAM policy to include only necessary roles with the least
  privilege principle.
