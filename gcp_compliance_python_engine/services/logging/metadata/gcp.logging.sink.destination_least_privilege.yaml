title: Ensure Sink Destination Uses Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Applying the least privilege principle to logging sink destinations is
  critical to minimize potential security breaches, data leaks, or unauthorized data
  access. Overprivileged access could lead to unintentional data modification or exposure,
  threatening compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Implementing strict
  access controls helps protect sensitive data and ensures adherence to regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule checks that all logging sinks in GCP are configured with the
  least privilege principle, ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted
  to the sink destination. To verify, review the IAM roles assigned to the sink destination
  and remove any superfluous permissions. Remediation involves aligning permissions
  with specific data access and processing needs, and periodically auditing these
  permissions to ensure ongoing compliance.
