title: Enable Read Events Logging for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling read events logging for GCP Storage Buckets is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into data access patterns, detecting unauthorized access, and ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations. This facilitates auditing and incident
  response by providing a detailed record of who accessed which data and when. Without
  read events logging, organizations risk undetected data exfiltration and non-compliance
  with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks whether read access logging is enabled for all GCP Storage
  Buckets. To verify, ensure that Google Cloud Audit Logs are configured to capture
  'dataRead' events on storage buckets. Remediation involves enabling Cloud Audit
  Logging for 'DATA_READ' events by setting up the required IAM permissions and configuring
  the appropriate log sinks to store these logs in a centralized location for analysis.
