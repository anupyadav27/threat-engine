title: Enable Bucket Immutability or Object Lock for GCP Logging
rationale: Ensuring data immutability helps protect against tampering and unauthorized
  alterations, enhancing data integrity and compliance with regulations like GDPR
  and CCPA. This is crucial for audit logs which serve as evidence during forensic
  investigations or audits, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring accountability.
description: This rule checks if GCP logging buckets have immutability or object lock
  enabled, where supported. Immutability prevents any modification or deletion of
  log data for a specified retention period, ensuring data integrity. To verify, check
  bucket settings in the GCP Console or use the 'gsutil' command-line tool. Remediation
  involves configuring bucket policies to enable immutability or setting object lock
  policies to enforce write-once-read-many (WORM) compliance.
