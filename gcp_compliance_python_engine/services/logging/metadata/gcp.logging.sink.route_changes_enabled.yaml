title: Ensure Logging Sinks Route Changes are Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging for route changes is critical for maintaining network
  integrity and security. It allows for monitoring of unauthorized or incorrect routing
  modifications that could lead to data breaches or loss of connectivity. Compliance
  with regulations such as PCI-DSS and NIST requires auditing of network changes,
  making it essential for both security and regulatory adherence.
description: This rule checks if logging sinks are configured to capture route changes
  within Google Cloud Platform. Logging these changes helps in tracking configuration
  alterations, facilitating incident response, and maintaining a historical record
  for audit purposes. To verify, ensure that your logging sinks have filters set up
  to capture route modification events. Remediation involves configuring or updating
  logging sinks to include route change events by using the Google Cloud Console or
  gcloud command-line tool.
