title: Ensure TLS 1.2+ for Logging Sink Destinations
rationale: Enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher for logging sink destinations ensures data
  is securely transmitted, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized
  data access. This compliance measure is vital for maintaining data integrity and
  confidentiality, aligning with industry standards and regulatory frameworks such
  as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that all logging sinks in GCP enforce a minimum of TLS
  1.2 when transmitting logs to their destinations. To verify, review the sink configurations
  in the Google Cloud Console or via gcloud CLI to ensure TLS settings specify version
  1.2 or higher. Remediation involves updating the sink configuration to enforce TLS
  1.2+; this can be done by modifying the sink destination's security settings to
  meet the required TLS version.
