title: Ensure Logging Buckets Have Write Events Enabled
rationale: Enabling write events for logging buckets is crucial for maintaining an
  audit trail of changes and data writes, which is essential for forensic investigations
  and compliance audits. Without these logs, unauthorized data alterations or deletions
  may go undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with
  regulations such as PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if the write events logging is enabled for all logging
  buckets within the GCP environment. To verify, ensure that bucket-level logging
  is configured to capture and store write operations. Remediation involves adjusting
  the logging configuration to include write events, which can be done via the GCP
  Console or using gcloud command-line tools. This ensures that any changes to the
  data are recorded, facilitating monitoring and compliance.
