title: Enable Server Access Logging for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling server access logging for GCP storage buckets helps organizations
  track and analyze access patterns to their data, which is critical for identifying
  unauthorized access attempts and ensuring accountability. This visibility supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and SOC 2, which mandate rigorous
  data access monitoring. Additionally, it aids in forensic investigations by providing
  detailed logs of read and write operations.
description: This rule checks whether server access logging is enabled for Google
  Cloud Storage buckets. To ensure logging, configure the bucket to write logs to
  a designated logging bucket. This involves setting the target bucket and ensuring
  the necessary permissions are granted for log writing. Verification can be done
  by checking bucket settings in the GCP Console or using the gcloud CLI. Remediation
  involves enabling logging through the GCP Console under bucket settings or via the
  gsutil command line tool.
