title: Ensure Logging Sinks Are Properly Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of logging sinks in GCP is crucial for security and
  compliance as it ensures that all relevant logs are captured and routed to appropriate
  destinations for analysis and alerting. Misconfigured sinks can lead to gaps in
  log data, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents, potentially
  resulting in data breaches or compliance violations with frameworks such as PCI-DSS,
  HIPAA, or ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if logging sinks in Google Cloud Platform are configured
  to capture and route logs from all relevant resources. Verify that sinks are set
  up to export logs to Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub for analysis and long-term
  storage. Ensure that the sinks are correctly filtering and including necessary log
  types like admin activity and data access logs. Remediation involves auditing current
  sink configurations and updating them to cover all critical resources and log types
  without gaps.
