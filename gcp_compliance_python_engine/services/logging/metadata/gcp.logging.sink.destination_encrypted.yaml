title: Ensure Logging Sink Destination is Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting log sink destinations is crucial for protecting sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
  Without encryption, log data stored in destinations such as Cloud Storage or BigQuery
  could be exposed to potential data breaches, leading to financial loss, reputational
  damage, and non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that all logging sink destinations are encrypted using
  Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. To verify, ensure that encryption
  is enabled at the storage level of the destination, such as Cloud Storage buckets
  or BigQuery datasets. Remediation involves configuring these destinations to use
  encryption keys for data protection, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console
  or gcloud command-line tool.
