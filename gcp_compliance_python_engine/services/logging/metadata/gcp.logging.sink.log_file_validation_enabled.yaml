title: Enable Log File Validation for Logging Sinks
rationale: Enabling log file validation ensures the integrity of logs by detecting
  unauthorized changes. This is critical for compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS
  and SOC2, which require audit trails to be tamper-proof. Without validation, malicious
  actors could alter logs to cover their tracks, leading to undetected breaches and
  financial penalties.
description: This rule checks if log file validation is enabled for logging sinks
  in GCP. Log validation uses cryptographic hashes to confirm that log entries have
  not been altered, ensuring data integrity. To verify, ensure that the `logFileValidation`
  field is set to true in the sink configuration. Remediation involves configuring
  your logging sinks to enable log validation, which can be done through the Console
  or CLI.
