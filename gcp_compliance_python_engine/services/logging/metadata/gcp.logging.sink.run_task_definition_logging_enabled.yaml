title: Ensure Task Definition Logging is Enabled for Logging Sinks
rationale: Enabling task definition logging for logging sinks is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into the operations and security posture of your GCP environment. It
  helps in detecting unauthorized access and misconfigurations, which could lead to
  data breaches or service disruptions. This control also supports compliance with
  regulatory requirements by ensuring that all task execution details are logged and
  auditable.
description: This rule checks whether logging sinks have task definition logging enabled,
  which records detailed information about task executions. To verify, ensure that
  each logging sink in your GCP environment is configured to capture task definition
  logs by setting the appropriate logging parameters. Remediation involves updating
  the sink configuration to include task definition logging, thereby improving audit
  capabilities and traceability.
