title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for GCP Logging Sinks
rationale: Enabling logging for GCP logging sinks is critical to maintain visibility
  over data flows and access patterns, which helps identify unauthorized access and
  potential security breaches. It supports compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS
  and GDPR, which mandate detailed audit logging for data access and modification.
  Without logging, organizations may face challenges in forensic investigations and
  risk significant penalties for non-compliance.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for all configured logging sinks
  in GCP projects. Ensuring that logging sinks have logging enabled captures all data
  flowing through the sinks, which is essential for audit purposes and incident response.
  To verify, navigate to the GCP Console, access the 'Logging' service, and ensure
  that log sinks are configured with appropriate logging destinations. Remediate by
  enabling or configuring logging for any sinks that lack it, using the gcloud logging
  sinks update command or through the GCP Console.
