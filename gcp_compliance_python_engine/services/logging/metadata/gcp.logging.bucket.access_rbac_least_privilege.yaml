title: Ensure Logging Buckets Use Least Privilege RBAC
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for logging buckets minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. It is crucial for preventing
  privilege escalation attacks and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  like GDPR and SOX. By enforcing strict access controls, organizations can safeguard
  sensitive log data that could be leveraged in threat detection and incident response.
description: This check verifies that all IAM roles assigned to logging buckets adhere
  to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it analyzes the roles associated
  with logging buckets to ensure they grant only the necessary permissions for users
  and services to perform their tasks. Remediation involves auditing IAM policies
  and adjusting roles to remove excessive permissions, typically by using predefined
  roles or creating custom roles tailored to specific needs.
