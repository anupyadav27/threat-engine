title: Ensure Logging Sinks Use Multi-Region Storage
rationale: Enabling multi-region storage for logging sinks ensures data redundancy
  and availability across multiple geographical locations, reducing the risk of data
  loss due to regional outages. This is crucial for maintaining business continuity
  and meeting compliance requirements that mandate data availability and resilience.
  Furthermore, it mitigates the impact of localized failures, enhancing the overall
  reliability of logging systems.
description: This rule checks if logging sinks are configured to use multi-region
  storage buckets, which distribute data across multiple regions. Multi-region buckets
  provide higher availability and durability compared to single-region buckets. To
  verify, inspect the sink's destination bucket settings to ensure it is configured
  as a multi-region bucket. Remediation involves updating the sink to point to an
  appropriate multi-region bucket, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console
  or using gcloud CLI commands.
