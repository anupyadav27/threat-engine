title: Enable Alerting for Project Ownership Changes via Log Metric Filter
rationale: Monitoring project ownership changes helps detect unauthorized access and
  prevent potential misuse of administrative privileges. Such changes can indicate
  an insider threat or credential compromise, impacting data integrity and compliance
  with regulations like GDPR and ISO 27001. Proactive alerting ensures timely response
  to suspicious activities, minimizing business risk.
description: This rule checks for the presence of a log metric filter and corresponding
  alert that monitors changes to project ownership. Ensure that a logging sink is
  configured to capture IAM policy changes, particularly those affecting owners. A
  metric should be created to filter these logs, and an alerting policy must notify
  security personnel of such changes. Remediation involves setting up the logging,
  metric, and alerting configurations in the GCP Console or via gcloud commands.
