title: Ensure Log Metric Filter Alarms Are Configured
rationale: Configuring alarms for log metric filters is crucial for proactive threat
  detection and timely response to potential security incidents. Without these alarms,
  critical events might go unnoticed, leading to data breaches, operational disruptions,
  or compliance violations. Properly configured alarms support compliance with standards
  like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 by ensuring that anomalies are promptly identified and
  addressed.
description: This rule checks whether alerting policies are configured for log metric
  filters in Google Cloud Logging. Alarms should be set up to notify administrators
  when specific audit logs indicate potential security threats or policy violations.
  To verify, review the list of log metrics in Cloud Monitoring and ensure that each
  critical metric has an associated alerting policy. Remediation involves creating
  alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring that trigger notifications based on log metrics
  thresholds or conditions.
