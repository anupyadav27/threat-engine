title: Verify GCP Logging Configuration for Audit Logging
rationale: Proper logging configuration is crucial for detecting unauthorized access
  and ensuring accountability. It helps organizations meet compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 by maintaining a tamper-proof log of security-related
  events. Failure to verify logging configurations can lead to undetected security
  incidents and non-compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks that all necessary audit logs are enabled in Google
  Cloud Platform for critical services. Ensure that Data Access audit logs are activated
  for resources handling sensitive data and Admin Activity logs are on for all services.
  To verify, navigate to the 'Logging' section in the GCP Console and check the audit
  log settings for each service. Remediation involves enabling these logs through
  the GCP Console or using the gcloud CLI to ensure comprehensive logging.
