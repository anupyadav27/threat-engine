rule_id: gcp.logging.log.access_rbac_least_privilege
service: logging
resource: log
requirement: Access RBAC Least Privilege
scope: logging.log.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure RBAC Least Privilege for Log Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for logging ensures that only authorized
  personnel can view or manipulate logs, reducing the risk of data breaches and insider
  threats. This approach minimizes the attack surface and aids in meeting compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls to sensitive
  information.
description: This rule checks whether the IAM roles assigned to users accessing GCP
  logs adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it verifies that
  users do not have overly permissive roles like 'Owner' or 'Editor' when not necessary.
  Remediation involves reviewing IAM policies and assigning more restrictive roles
  such as 'Log Viewer' to limit access. Validation can be performed through the IAM
  section in the GCP Console or using gcloud CLI commands to audit current role assignments.
