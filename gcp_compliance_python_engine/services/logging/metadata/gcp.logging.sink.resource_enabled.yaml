title: Ensure Logging Sink Resource is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging sinks is crucial for capturing and exporting logs that
  provide visibility into system activities, which helps in detecting anomalies and
  unauthorized access. It supports compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring
  that audit logs are retained and accessible for auditing purposes. Without enabled
  logging sinks, organizations risk missing critical security incidents and failing
  to meet legal obligations.
description: This rule checks whether logging sinks are enabled within your GCP environment.
  Logging sinks must be configured to export logs to external destinations such as
  Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub for long-term storage and analysis. Verification
  involves reviewing sink configurations in the GCP Console or using gcloud commands
  to ensure they are active. Remediation requires setting up new sinks or enabling
  existing ones to ensure all necessary logs are captured and exported.
