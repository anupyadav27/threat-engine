title: Ensure Route Change Alert Configured for Logging Sinks
rationale: Configuring alerts for route changes in logging sinks is crucial to detect
  unauthorized modifications that could divert log data, impacting incident detection
  and response. This helps maintain the integrity and availability of audit logs,
  which are essential for forensic investigations, compliance with standards like
  PCI-DSS, and maintaining trust in system operations.
description: This rule verifies that alerts are configured for route changes in logging
  sinks to ensure any unauthorized changes trigger an immediate response. To verify,
  ensure that alert policies in Cloud Monitoring are set up to monitor sink configurations
  for changes. Remediate by creating alert policies that monitor logging sinks and
  configure notifications to the appropriate security teams. This will help in promptly
  addressing any suspicious activities.
