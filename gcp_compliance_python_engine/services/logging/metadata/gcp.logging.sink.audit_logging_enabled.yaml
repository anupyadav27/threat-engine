title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Log Sinks
rationale: Enabling audit logging for log sinks is crucial for tracking access and
  changes to logging configurations, which can prevent unauthorized modifications
  and data exfiltration. Audit logs provide visibility into who accessed what resources
  and when, aiding in forensic analysis and regulatory compliance. Failure to enable
  audit logging can result in undetected malicious activity and non-compliance with
  standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for all configured
  log sinks in GCP. Audit logging must be activated to capture and store access logs
  and configuration changes. To verify, ensure that each sink has a corresponding
  audit log with appropriate permissions. Remediation involves configuring audit logs
  in the IAM & Admin section of the GCP Console and ensuring that all necessary permissions
  are granted for logging.
