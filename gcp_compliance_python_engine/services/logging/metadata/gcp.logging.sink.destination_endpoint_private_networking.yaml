title: Ensure Logging Sink Uses Private Networking for Destination
rationale: Routing logs through private networking minimizes exposure to public internet
  threats, reducing the risk of data interception and unauthorized access. This configuration
  aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate secure
  transmission of sensitive data. Additionally, it helps maintain the integrity and
  confidentiality of log data critical for auditing and forensic analysis.
description: This rule checks whether logging sinks in GCP are configured to route
  their destination endpoints via private networking, such as VPC Service Controls.
  To verify, ensure that the destination endpoint of your logging sink is a private
  IP or within a configured private network. Remediation involves updating the logging
  sink configuration to use a private IP address or ensuring it communicates through
  a VPC connector. This setup enhances security by preventing data from being exposed
  to the public internet.
