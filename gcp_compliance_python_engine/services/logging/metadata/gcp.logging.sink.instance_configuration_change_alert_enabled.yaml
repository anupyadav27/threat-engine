title: Enable Alerts for Instance Configuration Changes in Logging Sinks
rationale: Configuring alerts for instance configuration changes in logging sinks
  is crucial for maintaining system integrity and preventing unauthorized changes.
  Unmonitored changes can lead to potential security breaches, data loss, or compliance
  violations, exposing the organization to significant financial and reputational
  risks. Alerts ensure that security teams are promptly informed of any suspicious
  activities, facilitating rapid response and compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether alerts are enabled for configuration changes
  in GCP logging sinks. To verify, ensure that audit logs are configured to capture
  configuration changes and that notifications are set up to alert the security team.
  Remediation involves enabling audit logging for the sink resource and configuring
  alert policies in Cloud Monitoring to notify stakeholders of any changes. This setup
  helps in maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment by tracking alterations
  to logging configurations.
