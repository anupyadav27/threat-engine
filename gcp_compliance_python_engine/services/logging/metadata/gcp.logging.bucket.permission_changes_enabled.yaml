title: Enable Logging for Bucket Permission Changes
rationale: Monitoring permission changes in GCP storage buckets is crucial because
  unauthorized alterations can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. By
  logging these changes, organizations can detect and respond to unauthorized access
  attempts, ensuring data integrity and adherence to security frameworks like NIST
  and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for permission changes on GCP
  storage buckets. It verifies that the appropriate audit logs are configured to capture
  IAM policy modifications. To ensure compliance, configure the logging settings in
  the GCP Console or through the gcloud CLI to track these changes. Remediation involves
  enabling 'Admin Activity' logs for the storage bucket, ensuring that all permission
  modifications are recorded and can be audited.
