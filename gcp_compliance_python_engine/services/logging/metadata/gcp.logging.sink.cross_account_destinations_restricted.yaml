title: Restrict GCP Logging Sinks to Same Account Destinations
rationale: Allowing logging sinks to export data to cross-account destinations can
  lead to unauthorized data exposure, violating data governance policies and increasing
  the risk of data breaches. Restricting this ensures that log data remains within
  the same GCP account, aligning with best practices for data protection and compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR, which mandate strict control over data transfers.
description: This rule checks if logging sinks in GCP are configured to export logs
  only within the same account. Logs exported to cross-account destinations could
  be accessed by unauthorized users, leading to potential data leaks. To verify, inspect
  the 'destination' field in the sink configuration and ensure it points to a resource
  within the same account. Remediate by updating the sink destination to a compliant
  storage location such as a Cloud Storage bucket, Pub/Sub topic, or BigQuery dataset
  within the same GCP account.
