title: Log IAM Permission Changes for Storage Monitoring
rationale: Monitoring IAM permission changes is crucial as unauthorized access or
  privilege escalations can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. By logging
  these changes, organizations can detect and respond to suspicious activities, ensuring
  data integrity and alignment with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and SOC2.
description: This rule checks whether audit logs for IAM permission changes are enabled
  and stored for GCP Storage resources. To verify, ensure that logging is configured
  to capture 'admin_activity' logs and that logs are retained for an appropriate period.
  Remediation involves setting up a log sink to export these logs to a secure storage
  bucket, enabling alerts for any unauthorized changes.
