title: Ensure Minimum Retention Days for Logging Sinks
rationale: Enforcing a minimum retention period for logging sinks helps ensure that
  logs are available for analysis and compliance auditing. Retaining logs for an adequate
  duration is crucial to detect and investigate security incidents, meet regulatory
  requirements, and support forensic investigations. Insufficient log retention can
  lead to gaps in security monitoring and hinder incident response efforts.
description: This rule verifies that all logging sinks in your GCP environment have
  a minimum retention period set for log entries. It checks the configuration of each
  logging sink to ensure that log data is retained for at least the specified minimum
  number of days. To remediate, configure your logging sinks to retain logs for the
  required period by adjusting the sink's retention settings in the Google Cloud Console
  or using the gcloud command line tool.
