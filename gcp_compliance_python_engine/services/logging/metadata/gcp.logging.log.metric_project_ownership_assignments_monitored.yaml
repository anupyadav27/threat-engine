title: Monitor Project Ownership Assignment Changes in GCP Logs
rationale: Monitoring project ownership assignments helps detect unauthorized changes
  that could lead to privilege escalation or data exfiltration. This is crucial for
  maintaining a secure and compliant environment, as ownership changes can impact
  access controls and auditability. Regular monitoring aligns with compliance standards
  like SOC2 and ISO 27001, which require tracking changes to critical GCP resources.
description: This rule ensures that changes to project ownership are being logged
  and monitored in GCP, allowing for quick detection and response to unauthorized
  modifications. To verify, ensure that relevant audit logs are enabled in the Cloud
  Logging service and that a log metric is set up to capture ownership change events.
  Remediation involves configuring a log-based metric to trigger alerts when ownership
  assignments are altered, ensuring continuous oversight and rapid incident response.
