title: Ensure Logging Buckets Use CMEK for Encryption at Rest
rationale: Using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encryption at rest in
  logging buckets enhances data security by granting organizations full control over
  the encryption keys, thus mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access or
  data breaches. This is crucial for meeting compliance requirements with standards
  such as ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS, which mandate robust encryption practices to protect
  sensitive information.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Logging buckets are configured to use
  Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data encryption at rest. To verify,
  check the bucket's encryption settings in the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud
  CLI to ensure a CMEK is specified. If not configured, set a CMEK by assigning a
  Cloud KMS key to the logging bucket, ensuring that the key is properly managed and
  access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
