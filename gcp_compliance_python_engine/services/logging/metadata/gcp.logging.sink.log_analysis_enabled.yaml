title: Ensure Log Analysis is Enabled for Logging Sinks
rationale: Enabling log analysis for logging sinks helps organizations monitor and
  audit activities in their GCP environment. This ensures timely detection and response
  to potential security incidents, supports forensic investigations, and fulfills
  regulatory compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and SOC2, which mandate comprehensive
  logging and monitoring practices.
description: This rule checks whether log analysis is enabled for all logging sinks
  in GCP. Logging sinks must be configured to export logs to BigQuery, Pub/Sub, or
  Cloud Storage for further analysis. To verify, ensure that the sink's destination
  is correctly set and that all required logs are being captured. Remediation involves
  configuring the sink in the Cloud Console or using gcloud CLI to direct logs to
  a supported analysis destination.
