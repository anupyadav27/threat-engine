title: Alert on Audit Configuration Changes in Logging Metrics
rationale: Monitoring audit configuration changes is vital to detect unauthorized
  modifications that could lead to misconfiguration or data breaches. Such changes
  may indicate a potential insider threat or a compromised account, impacting regulatory
  compliance and business integrity. Ensuring audit logs inform on these changes helps
  maintain accountability and facilitates incident response.
description: This rule checks for any alterations to the audit logging configurations
  in GCP logging metrics. It ensures that any changes to the audit settings are logged
  and generate alerts to notify security teams promptly. To verify, configure alert
  policies in Cloud Monitoring to trigger when specific audit log entries are created,
  indicating changes to logging configurations. Remediation involves reviewing the
  change, identifying the cause, and reverting unauthorized modifications.
