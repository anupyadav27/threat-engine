title: Enable Change Auditing for Logging Sinks
rationale: Enabling change auditing for logging sinks is crucial for tracking modifications
  that could affect logging integrity and availability. Unauthorized or accidental
  changes to logging sinks could lead to loss of critical log data, impacting forensic
  investigations and compliance with regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO
  27001. Continuous auditing helps in identifying and mitigating potential security
  threats by maintaining a comprehensive change history.
description: This rule checks whether change auditing is enabled for logging sinks
  in GCP. It ensures that any modifications to sink configurations are logged and
  monitored. To verify, ensure that Cloud Audit Logs are configured to capture 'Admin
  Activity' logs for logging sinks. Remediation involves setting up appropriate IAM
  permissions and configuring logging sinks to capture and store audit logs in a secure
  location, such as a dedicated Google Cloud Storage bucket or Pub/Sub topic.
