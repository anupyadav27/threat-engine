title: Ensure Minimum Retention for Privacy Audit Logs
rationale: Retaining audit logs for a minimum duration is crucial for forensic analysis
  and compliance with regulatory requirements. Insufficient retention periods could
  lead to loss of critical audit data, hindering incident investigations and exposing
  organizations to compliance risks with frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if the retention period for privacy audit logs in GCP
  is set to a minimum number of days. Audit logs should be retained for at least 365
  days to ensure compliance and support security investigations. To verify, navigate
  to the GCP Console, access the Logs Viewer, and check the retention settings for
  audit logs. If necessary, update the retention period in the Logging configuration
  settings to meet or exceed the minimum requirement.
