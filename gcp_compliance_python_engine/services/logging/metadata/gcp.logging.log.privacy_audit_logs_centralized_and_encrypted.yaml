title: Centralized and Encrypted Privacy Audit Logs
rationale: Centralizing and encrypting privacy audit logs is crucial for ensuring
  data integrity and confidentiality. This approach helps mitigate risks such as unauthorized
  access or tampering, which can lead to data breaches or compliance failures. It
  supports regulatory requirements like GDPR and helps in forensic investigations
  by providing a consistent and secure logging environment.
description: This rule checks that all privacy audit logs in your GCP environment
  are centralized in a designated logging project and encrypted using Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK). Ensure that your logs are routed to a central Cloud Logging
  bucket with CMEK enabled, which provides you control over the encryption keys. Verify
  the setup by inspecting the log sinks, and ensure CMEK is applied to the destination
  bucket.
