title: Enforce Least Privilege on Logging Sink IAM Policies
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to logging sink IAM policies
  minimizes security risks by ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive
  logging data. Without proper access controls, there's potential for unauthorized
  data exposure, leading to compliance violations with standards like GDPR or HIPAA,
  and increased risk of data breaches.
description: This rule checks if IAM policies attached to logging sinks grant only
  the necessary permissions for the intended operations. It ensures that roles like
  'roles/logging.viewer' or 'roles/logging.privateLogViewer' are not overly permissive.
  Verify by reviewing IAM policies on each sink in the Cloud Logging section of the
  GCP Console and remove any roles that provide more access than necessary. Implement
  least privilege by granting the minimal set of permissions required for each user
  or service account interacting with the logging sink.
