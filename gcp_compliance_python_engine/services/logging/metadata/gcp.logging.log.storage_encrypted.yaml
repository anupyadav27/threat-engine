title: Ensure Log Storage is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting logs at rest helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized
  access and breaches, which can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.
  It is crucial for compliance with data protection laws and regulations such as GDPR,
  PCI-DSS, and HIPAA, which mandate encryption of stored data to safeguard privacy
  and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks whether log data stored in Google Cloud Logging is encrypted
  at rest using Google-managed keys. To verify, ensure that the default encryption
  settings are enabled for your logging storage. Remediation involves configuring
  the logging service to use encryption by default, and optionally, leveraging Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) for more granular control of encryption keys.
