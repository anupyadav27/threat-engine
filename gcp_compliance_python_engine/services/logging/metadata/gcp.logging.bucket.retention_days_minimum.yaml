title: Ensure Logging Buckets Retain Logs for a Minimum Duration
rationale: Setting a minimum retention period for logging buckets is crucial for ensuring
  that audit logs are available for security reviews, incident investigations, and
  compliance audits. Insufficient retention periods can lead to loss of critical data
  which may result in undetected security breaches, non-compliance with regulations
  like GDPR or HIPAA, and potential financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether logging buckets in GCP have a minimum retention
  period configured. Logs should be retained for at least 30 days to ensure they are
  available for analysis and compliance purposes. To verify, navigate to the Logging
  > Logs Storage section in the GCP Console and check the retention settings for each
  bucket. If a bucket's retention period is less than the required minimum, update
  it to comply with your organizational policies by using the 'gcloud logging buckets
  update' command.
