title: Ensure Logging Sink Configuration Changes Are Monitored
rationale: Monitoring configuration changes to logging sinks is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and reliability of audit logs. Unauthorized or accidental modifications
  to sink configurations can disrupt log ingestion, leading to potential blind spots
  in security monitoring and compliance reporting. Ensuring changes are logged helps
  in forensic analysis and demonstrates accountability, aligning with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks whether configuration changes to logging sinks are being
  monitored and logged. The Google Cloud Logging service should be configured to track
  changes to sinks, which are responsible for exporting logs to specified destinations.
  To verify this, ensure that audit logging is enabled for the Google Cloud Logging
  service, particularly focusing on 'ADMIN_READ' and 'ADMIN_WRITE' operations. Remediation
  involves enabling and configuring audit logging for these operations through the
  Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI.
