title: Ensure Logging Sinks Are Properly Configured
rationale: Configuring logging sinks correctly ensures that critical logs are captured
  and sent to appropriate destinations for analysis and retention. This helps in detecting
  unauthorized access, tracking changes, and fulfilling compliance requirements such
  as PCI-DSS and NIST. Misconfigured sinks could lead to loss of important audit logs,
  impacting incident response and forensic investigations.
description: This rule checks that logging sinks in Google Cloud are properly created
  and configured to export logs to specified destinations like Cloud Storage, BigQuery,
  or Pub/Sub. It verifies that sinks are not left in a default or incomplete state,
  which could prevent logs from being exported correctly. To remedy misconfigurations,
  review the sink settings in the GCP Console or via gcloud command-line tool, ensuring
  destinations are correctly specified and IAM permissions are set to allow writing
  logs to those destinations.
