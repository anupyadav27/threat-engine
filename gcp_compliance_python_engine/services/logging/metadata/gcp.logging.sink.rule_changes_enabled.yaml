title: Enable Audit Logs for Sink Rule Changes
rationale: Enabling audit logs for sink rule changes is critical to ensure that any
  modifications to logging sinks are tracked and monitored. This helps in identifying
  unauthorized changes that could lead to data exfiltration or loss of critical logging
  data, impacting incident response and forensic investigations. Compliance with regulations
  such as PCI-DSS and SOC2 often requires detailed logging of configuration changes
  to maintain data security and integrity.
description: This rule checks if audit logs for modifications to logging sinks are
  enabled in GCP. It ensures that any changes to sink configurations are logged, providing
  a trail for security and compliance audits. To verify, check the 'Audit Config'
  in the IAM settings of your project to ensure 'ADMIN_READ' logs are enabled for
  the logging service. Remediation involves updating the IAM policy to include the
  necessary audit log configurations.
