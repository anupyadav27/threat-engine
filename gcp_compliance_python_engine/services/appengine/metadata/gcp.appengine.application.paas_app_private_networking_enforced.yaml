title: Enforce Private Networking for App Engine Applications
rationale: Enforcing private networking for App Engine applications ensures that the
  services are only accessible within your VPC, reducing exposure to the public internet.
  This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, aligning
  with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Private networking also
  supports better control and monitoring of traffic, enhancing overall security posture.
description: This rule checks whether App Engine applications are configured to use
  private networking, restricting access to the application to internal VPC resources.
  To verify, ensure that the 'app.yaml' file includes 'vpc_access_connector' settings
  or that the App Engine is using a serverless VPC access connector. Remediation involves
  configuring a serverless VPC access connector and updating the App Engine app configuration
  to reference this connector, thereby routing traffic through the VPC.
