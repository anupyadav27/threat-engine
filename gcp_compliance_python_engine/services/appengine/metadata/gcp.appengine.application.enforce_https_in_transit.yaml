service: appengine
resource: application
requirement: Enforce HTTPS In Transit
scope: appengine.application.security
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Enforce HTTPS for App Engine Application Traffic
rationale: Enforcing HTTPS ensures that data in transit is encrypted, protecting it
  from interception and tampering. This is crucial for maintaining user trust and
  meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate secure
  transmission of sensitive information. Unsecured data transmission can lead to data
  breaches, resulting in financial losses and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that your App Engine applications are configured to
  enforce HTTPS for all incoming traffic. To verify, ensure that the 'secure' option
  for URL handlers in the app.yaml file is set to 'always'. Remediation involves updating
  the app.yaml configuration and redeploying the application to require HTTPS. This
  practice prevents unencrypted data from being transmitted over the network, mitigating
  the risk of interception.
