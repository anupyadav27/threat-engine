title: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for App Engine Applications
rationale: Ensuring that App Engine applications enforce a minimum of TLS 1.2 is critical
  for safeguarding data in transit against interception and tampering. This reduces
  vulnerability to known cryptographic attacks targeting older versions of TLS, thereby
  complying with industry standards such as PCI-DSS and enhancing customer trust by
  protecting sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if Google App Engine applications are configured to
  enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2. Applications not meeting this requirement
  should be updated to specify TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure secure communication. This
  can be verified and configured through the Google Cloud Console under App Engine
  settings, or via the gcloud CLI tool by setting the 'min_tls_version' parameter
  in the 'app.yaml' file.
