title: Ensure App Engine Managed Updates Are Enabled
rationale: Enabling managed updates for App Engine applications helps maintain the
  security and stability of applications by automatically applying security patches
  and updates. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited and ensures
  compliance with security best practices, which is critical for protecting sensitive
  data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks if managed updates are enabled for App Engine applications.
  Managed updates automatically apply the latest security patches and updates, minimizing
  the need for manual intervention. To verify, check the App Engine settings in the
  Google Cloud Console or use the gcloud command-line tool. To enable, navigate to
  the App Engine settings and select the option to enable managed updates, ensuring
  your application remains secure and compliant.
