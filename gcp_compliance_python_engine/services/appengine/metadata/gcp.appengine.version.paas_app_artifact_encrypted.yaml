title: Encrypt App Engine Version Artifacts at Rest
rationale: Encrypting App Engine artifacts at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It mitigates the risks of
  data exposure in case of storage compromise and ensures compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate encryption of sensitive information.
  Implementing encryption also aligns with industry best practices to safeguard intellectual
  property and maintain customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the artifacts for App Engine versions are encrypted
  at rest using Google-managed keys. To verify, ensure that the App Engine service
  is configured to utilize Google Cloud's default encryption mechanisms. Remediation
  involves reviewing and confirming the encryption settings in the App Engine configuration
  and enabling encryption if not already set. Consider using Customer-Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) for additional control over encryption processes.
