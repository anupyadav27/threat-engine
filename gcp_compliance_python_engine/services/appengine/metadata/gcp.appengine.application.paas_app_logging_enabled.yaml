title: Ensure App Engine Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging for App Engine applications is crucial for monitoring
  application behavior, detecting anomalies, and responding to security incidents.
  Without logging, it becomes difficult to trace actions and events within the application,
  increasing the risk of undetected breaches and non-compliance with regulations like
  PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that logging is enabled for App Engine applications,
  ensuring that application requests and system events are recorded in Stackdriver.
  Verify by checking the App Engine settings in the Google Cloud Console under the
  'Logging' section. Enable logging by setting the appropriate logging level and ensuring
  logs are exported to a centralized logging solution. This facilitates audit trails
  and enhances incident response capabilities.
