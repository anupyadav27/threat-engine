title: Ensure App Engine Versions Are Immutable
rationale: Immutable application versions in GCP's App Engine prevent unauthorized
  changes to application code and configurations post-deployment, reducing the risk
  of introducing vulnerabilities or errors. This practice supports compliance with
  standards requiring controlled software deployment processes, such as ISO 27001
  and SOC 2, and mitigates the risk of inadvertent or malicious alterations that could
  lead to service disruptions or data breaches.
description: This rule checks that deployed versions of applications in GCP App Engine
  are immutable, meaning no changes can be made once a version is deployed. To verify,
  ensure that versioning and deployment practices enforce immutability, such as using
  CI/CD pipelines that lock versions post-deployment. Remediation involves adjusting
  deployment strategies and scripts to disallow updates to existing versions, instead
  deploying new versions for changes. This ensures a consistent and auditable deployment
  process.
