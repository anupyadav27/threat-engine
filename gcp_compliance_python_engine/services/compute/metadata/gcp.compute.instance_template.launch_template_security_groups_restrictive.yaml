rule_id: gcp.compute.instance_template.launch_template_security_groups_restrictive
service: compute
resource: instance_template
requirement: Launch Template Security Groups Restrictive
scope: compute.instance_template.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Ensure Launch Templates Use Restrictive Security Groups
rationale: Restrictive security groups in launch templates minimize exposure to unauthorized
  access by explicitly defining allowed traffic. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
  data access and potential breaches, aligning with compliance mandates such as PCI-DSS
  and NIST that require strict access controls around sensitive data handling.
description: This rule checks if GCP instance templates are configured with security
  groups that limit inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary protocols and ports.
  It examines the security group configurations associated with launch templates and
  flags those that allow overly permissive access. To remediate, restrict security
  group rules to the minimum necessary, ensuring only trusted IP addresses and essential
  services are permitted.
