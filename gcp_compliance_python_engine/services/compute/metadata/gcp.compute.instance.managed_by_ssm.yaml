title: Ensure Compute Instances Managed by Systems Manager
rationale: Managing compute instances with a centralized service like AWS Systems
  Manager (SSM) enhances operational efficiency and security by enabling automated
  patching, configuration management, and resource monitoring. This mitigates risks
  associated with manual instance management, reducing the likelihood of configuration
  drift and non-compliance with security policies. It also aids in achieving compliance
  with frameworks that require demonstrable controls over compute resources.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud compute instances are managed by AWS
  Systems Manager, ensuring that they are configured for automated management tasks.
  Verify that the SSM agent is installed and properly configured on each instance,
  and that instances are registered with the Systems Manager service. To remediate,
  install the SSM agent on unmanaged instances and configure them to communicate with
  the Systems Manager, allowing for automated updates and configuration management.
