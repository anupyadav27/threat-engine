title: Ensure VM Root Volume is Encrypted with Customer-Managed Keys
rationale: Encrypting the VM root volume with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
  provides enhanced data security by allowing customers to control and manage the
  encryption keys. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance
  with regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which require strong encryption
  controls. Without CMEK, organizations face increased risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks if the VM root volume is encrypted using Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys on Google Cloud Platform. To verify, ensure that CMEK is enabled
  for the disk encryption settings during the creation of the VM instance. Remediation
  involves setting up a Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) key and applying it to
  the VM root volume. This ensures that encryption keys are under customer control,
  providing better security and compliance with industry standards.
