title: Ensure Health Checks Use DNS, HTTPS, or TLS
rationale: Using DNS, HTTPS, or TLS for health checks is crucial to protect data in
  transit from interception or tampering, ensuring the reliability and security of
  services. Failure to use encrypted protocols can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  access, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Platform health checks are configured
  to use DNS, HTTPS, or TLS protocols, ensuring that data in transit is encrypted.
  Verify that health checks are not set to use unencrypted protocols such as HTTP.
  To remediate, modify health check configurations to use HTTPS or TLS by navigating
  to the Cloud Console, selecting the appropriate health check, and updating the protocol
  settings.
