title: Ensure Shielded VM Compliance for Compute Instances
rationale: Shielded VMs protect against rootkits and bootkits by ensuring instances
  boot with verified images, thus minimizing the risk of unauthorized code execution.
  This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance with security standards
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, particularly in environments handling sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that Compute Engine instances have Shielded VM features
  enabled, including Secure Boot, vTPM, and Integrity Monitoring. To check compliance,
  review the instance configurations in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI, ensuring
  these features are activated. Remediation involves enabling Shielded VM options
  under the instance's security settings to enhance threat resistance.
