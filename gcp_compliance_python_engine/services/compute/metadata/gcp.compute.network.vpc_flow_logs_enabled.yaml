title: Enable VPC Flow Logs for Enhanced Network Monitoring
rationale: Enabling VPC Flow Logs provides detailed visibility into network traffic,
  helping to detect anomalies and potential security threats. This is crucial for
  identifying unauthorized access attempts and ensuring data integrity, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and supporting forensic investigations. Additionally,
  it aids in meeting compliance requirements by providing necessary audit trails for
  regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks if VPC Flow Logs are enabled for all networks in GCP.
  VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network
  interfaces within a VPC, allowing for detailed analysis of network flows. To verify,
  ensure that VPC Flow Logs are configured in the Google Cloud Console under the VPC
  network settings. Remediation involves enabling Flow Logs for each subnet, specifying
  the desired aggregation interval, sampling rate, and logging metadata. This setup
  enhances the ability to monitor network activity effectively.
