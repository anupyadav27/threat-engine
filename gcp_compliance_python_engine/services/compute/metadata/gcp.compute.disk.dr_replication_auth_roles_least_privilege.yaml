title: Ensure Least Privilege for DR Replication Auth Roles
rationale: Restricting the roles for disaster recovery (DR) replication to the least
  privilege necessary reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Excessive permissions can lead to accidental or malicious data manipulation, impacting
  business continuity and potentially violating compliance standards such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that only the minimum necessary permissions are granted
  for roles involved in DR replication for compute disks. Ensure that roles are strictly
  defined to avoid excessive permissions that could be misused. Verification involves
  reviewing IAM policies assigned to resources managing DR replication and removing
  any permissions that are not essential. Remediation involves customizing roles to
  limit permissions to only those required for DR replication operations.
