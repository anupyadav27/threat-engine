title: Prevent Unintended Internet Paths in VPC Route Tables
rationale: Unintended internet exposure from misconfigured VPC route tables can lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations. Ensuring
  that only intended internet paths are configured reduces the risk of exposing sensitive
  resources, aligning with best practices for network security and meeting regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule checks for unintended internet paths in VPC route tables, specifically
  looking for default routes that may inadvertently expose internal resources to the
  internet. To verify, review route tables for any 0.0.0.0/0 routes and ensure they
  direct traffic only through secure gateways like Cloud NAT or specific VPN connections.
  Remediation involves removing or correcting any routes that allow unintended internet
  access, ensuring traffic is routed through secure, intended paths.
