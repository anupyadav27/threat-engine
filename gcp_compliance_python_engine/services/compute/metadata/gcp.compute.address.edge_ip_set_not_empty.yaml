service: compute
resource: address
requirement: Edge Ip Set Not Empty
scope: compute.address.security
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Ensure Edge IP Set on Compute Addresses is Configured
rationale: Having an empty Edge IP set on a compute address can lead to potential
  security risks including unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data. Proper
  configuration ensures that only designated IPs can access resources, aligning with
  security best practices and compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that the Edge IP set for compute addresses in Google
  Cloud Platform is not empty, ensuring that access is limited to specified IP ranges.
  To verify, inspect the configuration of each address in the GCP Console or via gcloud
  CLI to confirm that Edge IPs are properly set. Remediation involves updating the
  Edge IP set configuration to include all necessary IP ranges, ensuring compliance
  with your organization's access policies.
