title: Ensure Compute Instances Have Shielded VM Enabled
rationale: Enabling Shielded VMs helps protect your instances from rootkits, bootkits,
  and other persistent threats by verifying the integrity of the VM's boot process.
  Without this protection, instances are vulnerable to advanced attacks that can lead
  to data breaches, compliance violations, and operational disruptions.
description: This rule checks that all Google Compute Engine instances have Shielded
  VM features enabled. Shielded VMs provide verifiable integrity of the boot process
  and help prevent and detect unauthorized changes. To verify, ensure 'vulnerabilityProtection'
  is enabled in the instance's configuration. Remediate by configuring existing instances
  to use Shielded VM features via the GCP Console or CLI, and configure new instances
  with Shielded VM settings from the start.
