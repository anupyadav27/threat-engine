title: Ensure Secure Ciphers in Backend Service SSL Policies
rationale: Using secure ciphers in SSL policies is crucial to protect communication
  between clients and backend services from interception and attacks like man-in-the-middle.
  Insecure ciphers can lead to vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access to sensitive
  information, impacting confidentiality and compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if the SSL policies attached to backend services enforce
  the use of secure ciphers. A secure SSL policy should exclude deprecated ciphers
  like MD5, RC4, or anonymous ciphers. To verify, review the SSL policy configuration
  in the GCP Console under Compute Engine, ensuring compliance with recommended secure
  cipher suites. Remediation involves updating the SSL policy to include only approved
  ciphers, which can be done through the GCP Console or using gcloud commands.
