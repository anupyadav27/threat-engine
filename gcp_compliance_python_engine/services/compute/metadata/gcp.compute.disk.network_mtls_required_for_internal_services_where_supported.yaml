requirement: Network Mtls Required For Internal Services Where Supported
scope: compute.disk.network_security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Enforce mTLS for Internal Disk Services in Compute
rationale: Requiring mutual TLS for internal disk services mitigates risks such as
  unauthorized access and data interception by ensuring that both the client and server
  authenticate each other. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining
  compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strong encryption
  and authentication mechanisms to safeguard data privacy.
description: This rule checks that network mTLS is enabled for internal disk services
  where supported within Google Compute Engine. Verify that all internal services
  are configured to use mTLS by updating the load balancer settings or service configurations
  to require client certificates. Remediation involves configuring IAM roles and certificates
  in the GCP Console or using gcloud commands to enforce mTLS, ensuring secure communication
  channels.
