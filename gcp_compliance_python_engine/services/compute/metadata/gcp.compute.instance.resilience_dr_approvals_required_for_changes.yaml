title: Ensure DR Approval for Compute Instance Changes
rationale: Requiring Disaster Recovery (DR) approvals for changes to compute instances
  ensures that modifications are assessed for their impact on system resilience and
  business continuity. This process minimizes the risk of unauthorized changes that
  could lead to downtime or data loss, which is critical for maintaining service availability
  and meeting compliance requirements such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2.
description: This rule verifies that any configuration changes to GCP compute instances,
  such as network settings or instance types, require formal approval from designated
  DR personnel. Organizations should implement a change management process where all
  changes are logged and approved by relevant stakeholders. To remediate, configure
  a Cloud Function triggered by Cloud Audit Logs that enforces approval workflows
  for instance modifications.
