service: compute
resource: instance
requirement: Resilience Volumes Encrypted
scope: compute.instance.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Compute Instance Resilience Volumes are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting resilience volumes on Compute Instances is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data at rest from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Failure
  to encrypt could lead to data exposure in case of media theft or improper disposal,
  and may result in non-compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and
  HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether resilience volumes attached to GCP Compute Instances
  are encrypted. Encryption should be enabled by default using Google-managed keys
  or customer-managed keys for enhanced control. Verify encryption status through
  the GCP Console or gcloud CLI. To remediate, update the instance's volume settings
  to ensure encryption is enabled, which can be configured at instance creation or
  by modifying existing volumes.
