title: Ensure Desync Mitigation Mode is Configured for Backend Services
rationale: Configuring the Desync Mitigation Mode for backend services is critical
  to prevent desynchronization attacks that can lead to data corruption or unauthorized
  access. This configuration helps in maintaining consistent data flow and integrity
  across distributed systems, reducing the risk of downtime and potential breaches.
  Ensuring this setting aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO
  27001, which mandate secure configurations for network communications.
description: This rule checks if the Desync Mitigation Mode is enabled for Google
  Cloud Platform backend services. Desync Mitigation Mode helps protect against HTTP
  desync attacks by enforcing strict checks on HTTP/1.x request and response headers.
  To verify this setting, ensure that the 'desyncMitigationMode' field in the backend
  service configuration is set to 'ENABLED' or 'STRICT'. If this is not configured,
  update the backend service settings using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line
  tool to enable this feature.
