title: Enable Edge Rule Group Visibility for URL Maps
rationale: Enabling Edge Rule Group Visibility for URL Maps is crucial for maintaining
  transparency and control over HTTP(S) load balancing configurations. This setting
  helps detect unauthorized changes and ensures that traffic rules align with organizational
  policies, reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could lead to data breaches
  or service disruptions. Furthermore, it supports compliance with regulatory standards
  by providing a clear audit trail of load balancing configurations.
description: This check verifies that the Edge Rule Group Visibility Config is enabled
  for URL Maps within Google Cloud's HTTP(S) Load Balancing. When enabled, this feature
  allows administrators to see and audit the rules applied at the edge, ensuring proper
  configuration and facilitating troubleshooting. To enable this setting, navigate
  to the Google Cloud Console, select the appropriate URL Map, and activate the visibility
  configuration under the advanced settings. This action enhances visibility and management
  of traffic routing rules.
