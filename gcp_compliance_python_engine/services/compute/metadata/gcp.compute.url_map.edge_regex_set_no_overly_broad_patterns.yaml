title: Ensure URL Maps Do Not Use Overly Broad Regex Patterns
rationale: Overly broad regex patterns in URL maps can inadvertently expose sensitive
  endpoints, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This can
  increase the attack surface and complicate incident response efforts. Ensuring precise
  regex patterns aligns with security best practices and helps meet compliance requirements
  like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks URL maps for the presence of overly broad regex patterns
  that could match unintended paths. To verify, examine the 'pathMatcher' configuration
  in your URL map resources to ensure regex patterns are specific and targeted. Remediation
  involves refining regex patterns to only match the intended paths, reducing potential
  exposure of sensitive resources.
