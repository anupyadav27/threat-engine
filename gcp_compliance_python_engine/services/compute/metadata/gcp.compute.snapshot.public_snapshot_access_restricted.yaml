title: Restrict Public Access to Compute Snapshots
rationale: Allowing public access to Compute Engine snapshots exposes sensitive data,
  leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized data manipulation. It violates
  compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access
  controls. Restricting access minimizes the risk of data leakage and ensures data
  integrity essential for business continuity.
description: This rule checks for any Google Cloud Compute snapshots with public access
  permissions. Snapshots should be configured with private access, employing Identity
  and Access Management (IAM) policies to limit visibility and modifications to authorized
  users only. Remediation involves reviewing and modifying IAM policies to remove
  'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' roles from snapshot resources. Use the Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to adjust permissions and confirm settings.
