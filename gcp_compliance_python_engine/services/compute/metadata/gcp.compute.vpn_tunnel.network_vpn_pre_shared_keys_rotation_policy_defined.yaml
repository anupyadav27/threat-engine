title: Ensure VPN Tunnel Pre-Shared Keys Rotation Policy is Defined
rationale: Regular rotation of VPN tunnel pre-shared keys mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access due to key compromise. This practice is essential for maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of data transmitted over VPN connections and is often a requirement
  for compliance with security standards such as PCI-DSS and NIST. Failing to rotate
  keys can lead to prolonged exposure and increased susceptibility to brute force
  attacks.
description: This rule checks if a key rotation policy for VPN tunnel pre-shared keys
  is defined and enforced within GCP. To verify, ensure that the VPN tunnel configurations
  include a documented schedule for key rotation, ideally automating the process where
  possible. Implementing a policy involves setting a rotation frequency that aligns
  with your organization's security posture and regulatory requirements. Remediation
  includes configuring key rotation intervals in Google Cloud Console and using automation
  tools like Terraform for consistent enforcement.
