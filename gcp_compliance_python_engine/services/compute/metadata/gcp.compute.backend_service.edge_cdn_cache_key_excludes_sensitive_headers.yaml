title: Exclude Sensitive Headers from Edge CDN Cache Keys
rationale: Excluding sensitive headers from Edge CDN cache keys is crucial to prevent
  exposure of sensitive information such as authentication tokens, cookies, or personally
  identifiable information (PII). This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access
  or data leakage, which can lead to security breaches, loss of customer trust, and
  non-compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if sensitive headers are excluded from Edge CDN cache
  keys in GCP Backend Services. It ensures that headers containing sensitive data
  are not used in cache key creation, thereby reducing the risk of sensitive data
  exposure. To verify, inspect the backend service settings and ensure sensitive headers
  are not part of the CDN cache key configuration. Remediation involves updating the
  backend service configuration to explicitly exclude sensitive headers from cache
  key settings.
