title: Restrict Data Warehouse Firewall Egress Traffic
rationale: Unrestricted egress traffic from data warehouses can lead to data exfiltration
  and unauthorized access to sensitive data, posing significant business risks. Ensuring
  egress restrictions aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA,
  and mitigates threats like data breaches and insider threats.
description: This rule checks whether egress traffic from Data Warehouse security
  groups is appropriately restricted to prevent unauthorized data flows. It requires
  configuring firewall rules to limit outbound connections to only trusted IP ranges
  and necessary ports. To verify, review the firewall settings in the GCP Console
  under VPC Network > Firewall, and ensure egress rules are defined for the data warehouse
  subnet with least privilege access. Remediation involves updating firewall rules
  to enforce these restrictions.
