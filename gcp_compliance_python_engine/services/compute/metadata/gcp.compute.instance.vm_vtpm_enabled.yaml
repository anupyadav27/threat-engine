title: Ensure VM Instances have vTPM Enabled
rationale: Enabling the virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) on VM instances enhances
  the security by providing hardware-based cryptographic operations. This helps protect
  sensitive data and application workloads from unauthorized access and tampering,
  reducing the risk of data breaches. Compliance with security standards like PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA often require such measures to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
description: This rule checks whether vTPM is enabled for Google Cloud VM instances.
  The vTPM feature helps in securing VM instances by providing a hardware root of
  trust. To verify, navigate to the VM instance settings in the Google Cloud Console
  and ensure vTPM is enabled under the 'Shielded VM' options. Remediation involves
  activating vTPM on existing instances or configuring it during the creation of new
  instances.
