title: SSH Access from Internet Not Restricted
rationale: Allowing SSH access from the internet exposes your VM instances to potential
  unauthorized access and brute force attacks, increasing the risk of data breaches
  and service disruption. Restricting SSH access to specific IP addresses mitigates
  these risks and helps maintain compliance with security standards such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules that permit SSH access (TCP port
  22) from any IP address on the internet. To minimize security risks, SSH access
  should be restricted to specific IP ranges. Verify by reviewing firewall rules with
  open access and update them to allow connections only from trusted IP addresses
  or networks. Consider using Identity-Aware Proxy or VPN for more secure access.
