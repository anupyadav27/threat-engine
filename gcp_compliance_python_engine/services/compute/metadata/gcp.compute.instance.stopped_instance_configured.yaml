title: Ensure Stopped Instances Are Properly Configured
rationale: Unconfigured stopped instances may lead to unexpected charges and security
  risks if accidentally started with insecure settings. Ensuring that stopped instances
  are configured with necessary security measures helps prevent unauthorized access
  and data leakage, aligning with compliance requirements and safeguarding organizational
  assets.
description: This rule checks that all stopped Google Compute Engine instances have
  security configurations such as firewall rules, IAM policies, and network settings
  appropriately set. Administrators should verify that no critical data is stored
  on local disks and that instances have minimal access permissions. Remediating involves
  reviewing and updating instance configurations to meet security policies before
  they are started again.
