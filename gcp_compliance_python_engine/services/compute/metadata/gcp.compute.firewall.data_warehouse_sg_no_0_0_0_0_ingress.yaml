title: Restrict Ingress Traffic to Data Warehouse Firewalls
rationale: Allowing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 exposes the data warehouse to potential
  unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches. This misconfiguration
  can lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations such as PCI-DSS and
  GDPR, which mandate restricted access to sensitive data. Properly scoped firewall
  rules are crucial to safeguarding data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks for firewall configurations allowing ingress traffic
  from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) to data warehouses. To verify compliance, review
  firewall rules in the GCP Console or via the gcloud CLI to ensure that ingress traffic
  is restricted to specific IPs or ranges. Remediation involves updating firewall
  rules to specify allowed IP addresses, reducing exposure to only trusted sources.
