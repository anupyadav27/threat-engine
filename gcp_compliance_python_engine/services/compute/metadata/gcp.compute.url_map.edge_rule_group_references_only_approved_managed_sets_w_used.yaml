title: Ensure URL Maps Reference Approved Managed Sets
rationale: Using only approved managed sets in URL Maps helps mitigate the risk of
  unauthorized access and configuration drift, which can lead to potential exposure
  of sensitive data and service disruption. This practice supports maintaining consistent
  security policies across the cloud environment, aligns with compliance requirements,
  and helps prevent misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.
description: This rule checks that URL Maps in your GCP project reference only approved
  managed sets for edge rule groups. By enforcing this control, organizations ensure
  that only vetted and authorized configurations are applied, reducing the risk of
  security vulnerabilities. To verify, inspect the URL Maps configurations to confirm
  they are exclusively linked to the pre-approved sets. Remediate by updating URL
  Maps to reference only those managed sets that have been reviewed and approved by
  your security team.
