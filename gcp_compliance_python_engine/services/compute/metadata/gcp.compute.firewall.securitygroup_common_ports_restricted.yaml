title: Restrict Common Ports in GCP Firewall Rules
rationale: Open common ports such as 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) can expose
  your GCP resources to unauthorized access and potential attacks. Restricting access
  to these ports reduces the risk of exploitation from malicious actors, ensuring
  that only legitimate traffic reaches your services. This is crucial for maintaining
  compliance with security standards like NIST and ISO 27001 that require stringent
  access controls.
description: This rule checks that GCP firewall rules are configured to restrict access
  to common ports to only trusted IP ranges or specific service accounts. It ensures
  that open ports are not accessible from the internet at large, minimizing attack
  surfaces. Verify by reviewing firewall rule settings in the GCP Console or using
  gcloud commands. Remediation involves adjusting firewall rules to limit access to
  these ports, ideally using private IP ranges or VPC Service Controls.
