title: Ensure Compute Instance Groups Use Autoscaling
rationale: Autoscaling optimizes resource usage and cost by automatically adjusting
  the number of VM instances in a group based on demand. Not using autoscaling can
  lead to over-provisioning, increased costs, and potential performance issues during
  periods of high demand, affecting business continuity and customer satisfaction.
description: This rule checks if Compute Engine instance groups have autoscaling enabled.
  Autoscaling must be configured to automatically adjust the number of VM instances
  in response to workload demands. To verify, check the instance group settings in
  the Google Cloud Console under 'Compute Engine' > 'Instance groups'. If autoscaling
  is not enabled, configure it by setting up an autoscaling policy that suits your
  workload patterns. Consider factors such as target CPU utilization and custom metrics.
