title: Restrict Inbound Traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 in Firewall Rules
rationale: Allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 exposes your resources to the internet,
  increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  This configuration can lead to non-compliance with industry standards and regulations
  like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strict access control measures to protect
  sensitive data.
description: This rule checks for firewall configurations that permit inbound traffic
  from 0.0.0.0/0, indicating unrestricted access. Such settings should be avoided
  unless absolutely necessary. To verify, inspect your GCP Firewall rules in the Cloud
  Console or via gcloud commands. Remediation involves restricting the source IP ranges
  to known, trusted networks and applying the principle of least privilege. Consider
  using identity-aware proxies or VPNs to limit access where appropriate.
