title: Restrict SSH Access from the Internet
rationale: Allowing SSH access from the internet increases the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential exploits such as brute force attacks. Implementing restrictions
  helps protect sensitive data and resources, aligning with security best practices
  and compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules that allow SSH (port 22) access from
  any IP address. To enhance security, configure firewall rules to restrict SSH access
  to specific IP ranges or use identity-based access controls. Verify by reviewing
  firewall configurations in the GCP Console or using gcloud commands, and update
  rules to block 0.0.0.0/0 or to allow specific trusted IP addresses only.
