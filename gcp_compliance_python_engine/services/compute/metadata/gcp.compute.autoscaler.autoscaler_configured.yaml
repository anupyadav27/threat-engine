title: Ensure Autoscaler is Configured for Compute Instances
rationale: Properly configured autoscalers optimize resource allocation and cost efficiency
  while maintaining application performance. Failure to configure autoscalers may
  lead to resource exhaustion or unnecessary expenses, impacting business operations
  and violating cost management policies. Inadequate scaling can also result in service
  interruptions, affecting user experience and compliance with service level agreements.
description: This rule checks if the autoscaler is properly configured for compute
  instances by verifying the presence of scaling policies and thresholds. Ensure that
  scaling policies align with workload demands and are set to automatically adjust
  resources based on metrics such as CPU utilization or request load. To verify, review
  the autoscaler settings in the Google Cloud Console under Compute Engine > Autoscaler.
  Ensure that policies are active and thresholds are set appropriately. Remediation
  involves configuring or adjusting autoscaling policies to match application performance
  and cost objectives.
