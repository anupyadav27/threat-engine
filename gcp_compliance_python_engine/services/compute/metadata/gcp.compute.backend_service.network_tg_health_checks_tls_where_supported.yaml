title: Ensure TLS for Health Checks on Network Tg Where Supported
rationale: Implementing TLS for network target group health checks enhances data integrity
  and confidentiality by encrypting the health check data in transit. This reduces
  the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring that health checks cannot be intercepted
  or altered, thus maintaining the reliability and security of backend services. Compliance
  with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often require encryption in transit,
  making TLS implementation crucial for meeting these standards.
description: This rule checks if TLS is enforced on network target group health checks
  where supported, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted in transit. Verify that
  the backend services utilizing network target groups have health checks configured
  with TLS. If not configured, update the health checks to support and enforce TLS
  by specifying the 'useSsl' attribute to 'true' in the health check configuration.
  This configuration can be reviewed and modified in the GCP Console or via the gcloud
  command-line tool.
