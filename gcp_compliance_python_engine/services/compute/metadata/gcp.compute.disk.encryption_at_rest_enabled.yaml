rule_id: gcp.compute.disk.encryption_at_rest_enabled
service: compute
resource: disk
requirement: Encryption At Rest Enabled
scope: compute.disk.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for Compute Disks
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest protects sensitive data stored on Compute Engine
  disks from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is critical for
  maintaining business reputation, preventing financial loss from data theft, and
  adhering to regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Compute Engine disks have encryption at rest enabled
  using either Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. To verify, check
  the disk's encryption settings in the GCP Console or via the gcloud CLI. Remediation
  involves enabling encryption for disks without it, which can be done by configuring
  the disk to use Google-managed keys or by specifying a customer-managed key in Cloud
  KMS.
