title: Ensure Least Privilege for Compute Instance DR Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Disaster Recovery (DR) roles on GCP Compute
  Instances minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Overprivileged
  accounts can lead to misuse or exploitation during an incident, increasing the potential
  for data loss and non-compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
  Least privilege helps ensure that only necessary permissions are granted, supporting
  both security and compliance objectives.
description: This rule checks if DR roles associated with compute instances are granted
  only the permissions essential for their function, avoiding excessive privileges.
  Verify role assignments by reviewing IAM policies and ensure that roles like 'Compute
  Instance Admin' are not overly broad. Remediation involves auditing roles with 'gcloud'
  commands and refining IAM policies to adhere strictly to the principle of least
  privilege, assigning custom roles if necessary.
