title: Ensure Images Are Scanned and Free of Critical Vulnerabilities
rationale: Conducting vulnerability scans on images helps prevent the deployment of
  workloads with critical security flaws that could be exploited by attackers, thereby
  reducing the risk of data breaches and service disruptions. This practice is crucial
  for maintaining a secure cloud environment and meeting compliance requirements such
  as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate vulnerability management and secure configurations.
description: This rule checks that all Compute Engine images have undergone vulnerability
  scanning and contain no critical vulnerabilities. To verify, ensure that images
  in use are regularly scanned using tools like Google Cloud's Container Analysis
  or third-party security solutions. Remediation involves updating or patching images
  to address any critical vulnerabilities found, or replacing them with secure, compliant
  versions.
