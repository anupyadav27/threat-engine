title: Ensure Non-PII Telemetry for Compute Instance Resilience
rationale: Ensuring that telemetry data from compute instances used for disaster recovery
  (DR) is devoid of personally identifiable information (PII) mitigates privacy risks
  and data breaches. This practice supports compliance with privacy regulations such
  as GDPR, enhances data protection, and reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure
  in DR scenarios.
description: This rule verifies that compute instances configured for resilience and
  disaster recovery in GCP do not include PII in their telemetry data. It checks the
  telemetry configuration to ensure data minimization principles are followed. Administrators
  should review and configure telemetry settings to exclude PII, using GCP's logging
  and monitoring services to filter and control data flow. Remediation involves auditing
  telemetry configurations and applying filters or exclusions to sensitive data fields.
