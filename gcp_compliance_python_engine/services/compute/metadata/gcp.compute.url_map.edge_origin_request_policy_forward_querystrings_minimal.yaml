title: Ensure Minimal Forwarding of Querystrings in Edge Origin Requests
rationale: Forwarding unnecessary querystrings in edge origin requests can expose
  sensitive data and lead to security vulnerabilities such as information leakage.
  This configuration minimizes data exposure, reducing the risk of attacks such as
  query injection and helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations by
  ensuring only essential data is transmitted.
description: This rule checks whether your GCP URL Maps are configured to forward
  only the minimal necessary set of querystrings in edge origin requests. To verify,
  review the URL Maps in your GCP project and ensure the 'forwardQueryString' setting
  is minimized. Remediation involves modifying the URL Map configuration to restrict
  querystring forwarding to only those necessary for application functionality, which
  can be done through the GCP Console or gcloud command line tool.
