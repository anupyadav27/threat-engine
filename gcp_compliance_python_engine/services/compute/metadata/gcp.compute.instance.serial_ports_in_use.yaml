title: Ensure Serial Ports Are Disabled for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling serial ports on Google Cloud Compute instances can expose sensitive
  information and create potential entry points for unauthorized access. This setting
  should be disabled to mitigate risks associated with data leaks and unauthorized
  configuration changes, which can lead to compliance violations with standards such
  as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for the presence of enabled serial ports on GCP Compute
  Engine instances. To ensure secure configuration, serial ports should be disabled
  unless explicitly required for troubleshooting purposes. Users can verify this setting
  by checking the metadata of each instance and can disable serial ports by setting
  the 'enable-serial-port' metadata key to 'false'. Remediation involves updating
  the instance metadata to disable serial ports across all instances.
