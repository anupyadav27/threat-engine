title: Ensure Network Microsegmentation Policies on GCP Firewall
rationale: Applying network microsegmentation endpoint policies is crucial for minimizing
  lateral movement within the network, thereby reducing the attack surface. This enhances
  the security posture by ensuring that only necessary and explicit communications
  are allowed between network segments, which is essential for meeting regulatory
  requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for the application of network microsegmentation policies
  on GCP firewall configurations, ensuring that endpoint policies are properly applied
  to manage and restrict traffic flows. Verify that the firewall rules are configured
  to enforce microsegmentation by using network tags or service accounts to define
  granular access controls. Remediation involves auditing current configurations and
  applying policies that enforce strict traffic segregation between different network
  zones.
