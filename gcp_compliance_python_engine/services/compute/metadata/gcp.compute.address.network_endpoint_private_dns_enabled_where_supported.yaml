title: Enable Private DNS for Network Endpoints in GCP Compute
rationale: Enabling Private DNS for network endpoints enhances security by ensuring
  that DNS queries are resolved within the private network, reducing exposure to DNS
  spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. This configuration is critical for maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity, especially for organizations handling sensitive
  information. Additionally, it aligns with compliance requirements for data protection
  under standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Private DNS is enabled for network endpoints in GCP
  Compute where supported. Verification involves checking the DNS configuration of
  network endpoints to ensure they use private DNS zones. To remediate, configure
  network endpoints to use private DNS by specifying a private DNS policy in the endpoint's
  settings, ensuring secure and private resolution of DNS queries.
