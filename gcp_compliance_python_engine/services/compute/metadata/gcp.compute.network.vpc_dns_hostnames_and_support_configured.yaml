title: Ensure VPC DNS Hostnames and Support are Properly Configured
rationale: Configuring VPC DNS hostnames and support is crucial for smooth internal
  DNS resolution, which enhances network efficiency and security. Without proper configuration,
  instances may face difficulties in resolving internal hostnames, leading to potential
  service disruptions. This setting is also vital for meeting certain regulatory requirements
  that mandate proper network configuration and access controls.
description: This rule checks whether VPC networks have DNS hostnames and support
  enabled, facilitating internal DNS resolution for instances. Verify this configuration
  by navigating to the 'VPC Network' settings in the Google Cloud Console and ensuring
  that both 'DNS Hostnames' and 'DNS Resolution' are enabled. Remediate by enabling
  these options to ensure seamless connectivity and compliance with network security
  best practices.
