title: Ensure CMK or CMEK Configured for Compute Disks
rationale: Configuring Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) or Customer-Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) for Compute Engine disks ensures that your data is encrypted with keys
  you control. This enhances data security by protecting sensitive information from
  unauthorized access and meets compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS
  which mandate strong encryption practices.
description: This rule checks if Compute Engine disks are configured with CMK or CMEK.
  Disks not using these keys rely on Google-managed encryption keys, which may not
  meet certain regulatory or organizational security requirements. To verify, review
  your disk settings in the GCP Console under 'Encryption' to ensure CMK or CMEK is
  selected. Remediation involves creating a key in Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)
  and applying it to your disks.
