title: Restrict Cost Purchase Permissions for Reservations
rationale: Restricting permissions for cost purchases on reservations mitigates the
  risk of unauthorized or inadvertent financial commitments, which can lead to unexpected
  cost overruns. It ensures that only designated personnel can make such purchases,
  aligning with financial governance and compliance requirements like SOC2 and ISO
  27001.
description: This check verifies that only authorized users or roles have permissions
  to purchase committed use discounts on Compute Engine reservations. To ensure compliance,
  review IAM policies to confirm that the 'roles/compute.reservationAdmin' role is
  only granted to trusted accounts. Remediation involves auditing IAM policies and
  revoking permissions from unauthorized users, thereby preventing unintended financial
  liabilities.
