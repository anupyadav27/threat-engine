service: compute
resource: instance_template
requirement: Launch Template Root Volume Encrypted By Default
scope: compute.instance_template.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: critical
title: Ensure Root Volume Encryption in Instance Templates
rationale: Encrypting the root volume of instance templates by default is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data at rest. Without encryption, unauthorized access to
  storage media could lead to data breaches, violating compliance with standards like
  PCI-DSS and HIPAA, and potentially resulting in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether the root volumes in GCP instance templates are
  encrypted by default. It ensures that all new instances launched from these templates
  have their root volumes encrypted using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, review the instance template settings for disk encryption properties.
  Remediation involves enabling encryption for disks in the instance template settings
  via the GCP Console or CLI.
