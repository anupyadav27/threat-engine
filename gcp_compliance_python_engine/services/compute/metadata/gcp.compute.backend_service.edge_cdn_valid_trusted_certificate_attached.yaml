title: Ensure Valid Trusted Certificates for Edge CDN in Backend Services
rationale: Attaching a valid trusted certificate to your backend service's edge CDN
  is critical for ensuring encrypted data transmission over the network. Without a
  trusted certificate, data may be intercepted by attackers, leading to potential
  data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS. This
  not only affects customer trust but can also result in significant financial and
  reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether a valid trusted certificate is attached to the
  edge CDN of a GCP backend service. To verify, ensure that your backend service has
  a certificate issued by a recognized certificate authority (CA) and that it is not
  expired or self-signed. Remediation involves acquiring a valid certificate from
  a CA and configuring your backend service to use this certificate for its edge CDN.
  This ensures that data in transit is encrypted and secure, thereby protecting sensitive
  information.
