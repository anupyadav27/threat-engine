title: Ensure Subnet Flow Logs Are Configured in GCP
rationale: Enabling subnet flow logs helps capture IP traffic information, which is
  crucial for monitoring network activity, diagnosing network issues, and detecting
  potential security incidents. Without flow logs, organizations may have blind spots
  in their network security posture, increasing the risk of undetected anomalies and
  non-compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and SOC 2.
description: This rule verifies that subnet flow logs are enabled for each Google
  Cloud Platform VPC network. To ensure compliance, navigate to the 'VPC network'
  section in the GCP Console, select the desired subnet, and verify that flow logs
  are set to 'On'. If not enabled, adjust the settings accordingly to capture and
  analyze network data for better security monitoring and incident response capabilities.
