title: Ensure Regex Sets Are Utilized in URL Map Rules
rationale: Utilizing edge regex sets in URL maps enhances the security and performance
  of load-balanced applications by enabling more precise routing and traffic management.
  Failure to employ regex can result in inefficient routing rules, potential exposure
  to malformed requests, and reduced security posture. This practice aligns with regulatory
  requirements for protecting data in transit and maintaining a secure configuration
  baseline.
description: This rule checks if at least one rule in a URL map utilizes an edge regex
  set for matching requests. An edge regex set allows for advanced pattern matching,
  ensuring that traffic is directed based on specific and complex criteria. To verify,
  review the load balancer configuration for URL maps and ensure regex patterns are
  used where applicable. Remediation involves updating the URL map to include regex
  sets in the rules to improve traffic management and security.
