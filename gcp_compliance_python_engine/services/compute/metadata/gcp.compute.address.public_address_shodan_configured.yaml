title: Ensure Public IPs Are Not Indexed by Shodan
rationale: Exposing public IP addresses to Shodan poses a significant security risk
  as it enables potential attackers to easily identify and target these resources.
  This increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, data breaches, and exploitation.
  Compliance with security standards often requires minimizing exposure of sensitive
  resources to the internet to protect the organization's assets and reputation.
description: This rule checks if public IP addresses associated with Google Cloud
  Compute resources are indexed by Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected
  devices. Public IPs should be configured to minimize exposure and prevent indexing
  by Shodan. To verify, ensure that firewall rules restrict access to trusted IP ranges
  and that unnecessary services are disabled. Remediation involves auditing and adjusting
  firewall rules, and employing Cloud Armor to filter unwanted traffic.
