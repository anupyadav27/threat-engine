severity: medium
title: Ensure Snapshots Encryption for DR Logs & Artifacts
rationale: Encrypting snapshots used for disaster recovery (DR) ensures that sensitive
  data remains protected even in backup and recovery scenarios, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized data access. This practice is crucial for meeting compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate encryption of data at rest to protect customer
  data and maintain privacy standards.
description: This rule verifies that all Compute Engine snapshots, particularly those
  containing disaster recovery logs and artifacts, are encrypted using Google-managed
  or customer-managed encryption keys. To comply, navigate to the GCP Console, select
  'Snapshots', and ensure the 'Encryption' field indicates the use of a valid key.
  Remediation involves configuring existing snapshots to use encryption keys and ensuring
  new snapshots are automatically encrypted.
