title: Disable Default Network Usage in GCP
rationale: Using the default network in GCP can lead to security risks as it is automatically
  created with preconfigured firewall rules that allow broad access. This may expose
  your resources to unwanted traffic, increasing the attack surface and potential
  for unauthorized access. Ensuring custom network configurations helps meet compliance
  requirements and reduce vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks if the default network is in use within your Google
  Cloud Platform project. The default network comes with pre-established firewall
  rules that may not adhere to the principle of least privilege, posing a security
  risk. To mitigate this, create custom networks with specific firewall rules tailored
  to your application's security needs. Verification involves checking the network
  configurations and ensuring no resources are deployed on the default network. Remediation
  includes migrating existing resources to custom networks and deleting the default
  network if not needed.
