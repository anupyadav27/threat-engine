title: Ensure Edge Cache Policy Honors Cache Control Directives
rationale: Respecting Cache-Control directives such as 'no-store' and 'private' is
  crucial to prevent sensitive data from being cached at the edge, which can lead
  to unauthorized data access or data leaks. This practice minimizes the risk of exposing
  private information and aligns with privacy regulations and security best practices,
  ensuring that end-user data is handled securely.
description: 'This rule verifies that the Edge Cache Policy for URL Maps in Google
  Cloud respects ''Cache-Control: no-store'' and ''Cache-Control: private'' directives.
  To check, ensure that URL Maps are correctly configured to prevent caching of sensitive
  data when these directives are present. Remediation involves adjusting Edge Cache
  Settings in the URL Map to comply with these directives, preventing potentially
  sensitive information from being stored in edge caches.'
