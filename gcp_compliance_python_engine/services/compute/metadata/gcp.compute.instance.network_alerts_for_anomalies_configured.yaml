title: Enable Network Anomaly Alerts on GCP Compute Instances
rationale: Configuring network alerts for anomalies on GCP Compute instances is critical
  for timely detection and response to potential security incidents such as unauthorized
  access or data exfiltration. Network anomalies can indicate compromised instances,
  leading to data breaches, financial loss, and non-compliance with regulations like
  PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Proactively monitoring network activity helps mitigate these
  risks and ensures business continuity.
description: This rule checks whether network anomaly alerts are configured for GCP
  Compute instances. It ensures that Stackdriver Monitoring and Logging are set up
  to detect unusual network patterns, such as atypical traffic spikes or unexpected
  outbound connections. To verify, ensure that alerting policies are active in Stackdriver
  with conditions set for anomaly detection based on historical data. Remediation
  involves configuring Stackdriver to monitor network metrics and setting up alerts
  that notify security teams of any detected anomalies.
