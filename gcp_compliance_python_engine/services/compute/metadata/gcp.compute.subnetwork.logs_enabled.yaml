title: Enable Subnetwork Flow Logs in GCP Compute Engine
rationale: Enabling flow logs for subnetworks is crucial for monitoring network traffic,
  detecting anomalies, and identifying potential security threats. It provides visibility
  into network flows, aiding in incident response and forensic investigations. Moreover,
  it supports compliance with regulatory standards that require detailed logging of
  network activity.
description: This rule checks if flow logs are enabled for GCP Compute Engine subnetworks.
  Flow logs capture metadata about network traffic, which can be used for analysis
  and monitoring. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select 'VPC networks',
  and check the 'Flow logs' status for each subnetwork. To enable flow logs, edit
  the subnetwork settings and set 'Flow logs' to 'On'.
