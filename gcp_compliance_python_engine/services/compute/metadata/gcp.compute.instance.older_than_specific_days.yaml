title: Ensure Compute Instances Are Not Older Than Specific Days
rationale: Regularly updating and replacing older compute instances helps maintain
  security by ensuring that instances benefit from the latest security patches and
  updates. Older instances may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches. Maintaining a policy
  on instance age can also support compliance with standards that require up-to-date
  security measures.
description: "This rule checks for Google Cloud compute instances that have been running\
  \ longer than a specified number of days, which could indicate outdated software\
  \ or unpatched vulnerabilities. To verify compliance, review the creation date of\
  \ instances and compare against the organization\u2019s policy for instance lifecycle\
  \ management. Instances identified as older than the specified threshold should\
  \ be evaluated for updating or decommissioning. Implementing automated lifecycle\
  \ management tools can assist in mitigating risks associated with outdated instances."
