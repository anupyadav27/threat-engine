rule_id: gcp.compute.instance_group.volumes_encrypted
service: compute
resource: instance_group
requirement: Volumes Encrypted
scope: compute.instance_group.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Compute Instance Group Volumes are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting volumes protects sensitive data from unauthorized access and
  potential breaches by ensuring that data at rest is unreadable without the proper
  decryption keys. This is crucial for meeting regulatory compliance requirements
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection standards to safeguard personal
  and sensitive information.
description: This rule checks whether the persistent disks attached to instance groups
  in GCP Compute are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) or Google-managed
  encryption keys. To verify, review the encryption settings of each disk in the instance
  group via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI. If disks are not encrypted, configure
  encryption under 'Disks' by selecting an encryption key. This can be done during
  disk creation or by modifying existing disks.
