title: Ensure Min Frequency for Compute Snapshot DR Backups
rationale: Defining a minimum frequency for disaster recovery (DR) backups of snapshots
  is critical to minimize data loss and ensure data availability in the event of a
  failure. Regular backups enhance resilience by allowing businesses to quickly restore
  operations, thereby reducing downtime and mitigating financial and reputational
  damage. Compliance with industry regulations often mandates regular backup schedules
  to safeguard sensitive data against loss due to disasters.
description: "This rule checks if a minimum frequency for DR backup schedules is defined\
  \ for Google Cloud Compute snapshots. It ensures that snapshots are regularly backed\
  \ up according to a predefined schedule, which is crucial for effective disaster\
  \ recovery. To verify, review the configuration of snapshot schedules in the Google\
  \ Cloud Console or via gcloud CLI, ensuring that they meet the minimum frequency\
  \ requirements. If not configured, establish a backup schedule that aligns with\
  \ your organization\u2019s data recovery and business continuity objectives."
