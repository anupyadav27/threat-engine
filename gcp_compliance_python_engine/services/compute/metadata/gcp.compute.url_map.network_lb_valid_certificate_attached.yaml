title: Ensure Valid TLS Certificate on GCP Network Load Balancer
rationale: Ensuring that a valid TLS certificate is attached to a Google Cloud Platform
  (GCP) Network Load Balancer is critical for protecting data in transit. Without
  a valid certificate, sensitive data may be exposed to interception or tampering,
  leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA, which require secure data transmission.
description: This rule checks that a valid TLS certificate is attached to the URL
  map of a Network Load Balancer in GCP. A URL map with an invalid or missing certificate
  can lead to unencrypted traffic, exposing data to security threats. To verify, ensure
  that the URL map configuration includes a valid SSL certificate. Remediation involves
  updating or attaching a valid certificate to the load balancer using the GCP Console
  or gcloud command-line tool.
