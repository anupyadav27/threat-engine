title: Restrict Any-Any Firewall Rules in GCP
rationale: Allowing 'any-to-any' traffic in firewall rules can expose your network
  to unauthorized access and potential attacks. This configuration increases the risk
  of data breaches and non-compliance with security standards such as PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001, which mandate strict access controls to protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules in GCP that allow unrestricted access
  to and from any IP addresses. To verify, review the firewall configurations in the
  Google Cloud Console under VPC network settings and ensure no rules permit '0.0.0.0/0'
  as both source and destination. Remediation involves updating these rules to specify
  only the necessary IP ranges and ports, implementing least privilege access principles.
