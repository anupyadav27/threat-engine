service: compute
resource: instance
requirement: Paas Disk Encrypted
scope: compute.instance.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Compute Engine Disks Are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting disks at rest is critical to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. It mitigates risks associated with data exposure
  if the disk is compromised, aligning with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA that mandate encryption of sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that all persistent disks attached to Google Compute
  Engine instances have encryption enabled. By default, GCP encrypts data at rest
  using Google-managed keys, but customers can use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
  (CMEK) for additional control. To ensure compliance, verify that CMEK is applied
  where necessary and review the encryption status of disks through the GCP Console
  or CLI. If encryption is not enabled, configure CMEK by creating a key in Cloud
  KMS and associating it with the disks.
