title: Identify and Remove Unused Network ACLs in GCP
rationale: Unused Network ACLs in GCP can lead to potential security risks by allowing
  outdated or unnecessary access configurations to persist in the environment. This
  increases the attack surface and can inadvertently expose resources to unauthorized
  access. Regularly reviewing and removing unused ACLs is crucial for maintaining
  a secure and compliant cloud environment by ensuring that only necessary access
  permissions are in place.
description: This rule checks for Network ACLs in GCP that are configured but not
  actively used by any resources. Unused ACLs should be reviewed and removed to reduce
  complexity and potential misconfigurations. Verification involves checking the association
  of each ACL with network resources such as subnets or VMs. Remediation involves
  deleting the ACLs that are not in use, ensuring that no active resources depend
  on them, and documenting any changes made for audit purposes.
