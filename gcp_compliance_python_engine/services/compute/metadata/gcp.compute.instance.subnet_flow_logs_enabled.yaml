title: Ensure Subnet Flow Logs are Enabled for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling subnet flow logs provides visibility into the network traffic
  entering and leaving your compute instances, which is crucial for detecting anomalous
  activities and unauthorized access attempts. This visibility helps in identifying
  security threats and maintaining compliance with regulations that require detailed
  logging and monitoring of network activities.
description: This rule checks whether subnet flow logs are enabled for Google Cloud
  Compute instances. Subnet flow logs capture information about network traffic, which
  is essential for auditing and troubleshooting. To verify, navigate to the VPC network
  in the Google Cloud Console and ensure that flow logs are enabled for each subnet
  used by compute instances. Remediation involves modifying the subnet settings to
  enable flow logs, providing crucial data for network analysis and security auditing.
