subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Network ENI Security Groups Are Configured for Instances
rationale: Configuring security groups for network interfaces ensures that only authorized
  traffic can reach your instances, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity,
  and for complying with regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, which mandate strict
  access controls.
description: This rule checks if each network interface (ENI) associated with a GCP
  Compute Engine instance has an appropriate security group configured. Security groups
  act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
  To verify, inspect the instance's network interface settings in the GCP Console
  and ensure security groups are applied. Remediation involves assigning appropriate
  security groups to network interfaces to enforce the principle of least privilege.
