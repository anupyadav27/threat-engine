title: Restrict Inbound Rules for Compute Instance Network Security
rationale: Restricting inbound network access to compute instances minimizes the attack
  surface, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This
  is crucial for maintaining compliance with security frameworks such as PCI-DSS and
  HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls to protect sensitive data. By ensuring
  minimal and necessary network paths are open, organizations can significantly lower
  the likelihood of exploitation through network-based attacks.
description: This rule checks compute instances for overly permissive network security
  groups, specifically those with wide-ranging inbound rules. A restrictive security
  group should limit access to only necessary ports and IP ranges. To verify, review
  the security group's inbound rules and ensure they align with the principle of least
  privilege, allowing only required traffic. Remediation involves adjusting security
  group rules to close unnecessary ports and limit IP ranges to trusted sources.
