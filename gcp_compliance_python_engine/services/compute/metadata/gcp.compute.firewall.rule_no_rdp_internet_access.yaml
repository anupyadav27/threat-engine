title: Prohibit RDP Access from the Internet
rationale: Allowing RDP access from the internet increases the risk of unauthorized
  access, brute force attacks, and exposure to vulnerabilities. This can lead to data
  breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001, which require secure access controls and protection of sensitive
  data.
description: This rule checks for firewall configurations that permit Remote Desktop
  Protocol (RDP) traffic from any source IP address, which poses security risks. Ensure
  that RDP access is restricted to specific IP addresses or ranges, preferably through
  a VPN or private network. Remediation involves modifying firewall rules to specify
  only trusted sources for RDP traffic, thereby reducing the attack surface.
