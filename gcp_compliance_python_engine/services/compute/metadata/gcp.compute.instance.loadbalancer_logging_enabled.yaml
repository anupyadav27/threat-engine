title: Ensure Load Balancer Logging is Enabled for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling load balancer logging for compute instances is crucial for maintaining
  a comprehensive audit trail of network activity, which aids in identifying and mitigating
  potential security threats. This capability supports forensic analysis, performance
  monitoring, and can help meet compliance requirements related to data protection
  and incident response. Without logging, organizations might miss critical insights
  into traffic patterns and potential anomalies, posing a risk to both security and
  operational efficiency.
description: This rule verifies that load balancer logging is enabled for all Google
  Cloud compute instances, ensuring that all incoming and outgoing network requests
  are logged. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select 'Network services',
  then 'Load balancing', and check that 'Enable logging' is turned on for each load
  balancer associated with your instances. If not enabled, configure each load balancer's
  logging settings to ensure all traffic is logged and stored in Cloud Logging for
  review and analysis.
