title: Disable SSH Password Authentication for VM Instances
rationale: Disabling SSH password authentication reduces the risk of brute-force attacks
  and unauthorized access, as passwords can be easily guessed or stolen. This practice
  aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements by enforcing the
  use of stronger authentication methods like SSH keys, thereby enhancing the security
  posture of cloud workloads.
description: This rule checks if SSH password authentication is disabled on Google
  Cloud VM instances. Enabling SSH key-based authentication and disabling password-based
  access helps secure the VM from unauthorized logins. Verify the 'PasswordAuthentication'
  setting in the SSH configuration file is set to 'no'. Remediation involves updating
  the SSH configuration and restarting the SSH service on the VM instance.
