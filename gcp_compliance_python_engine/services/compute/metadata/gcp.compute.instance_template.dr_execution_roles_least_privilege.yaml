title: Enforce Least Privilege on DR Execution Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Disaster Recovery (DR) execution roles
  is critical to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of compute resources.
  Over-permissioned roles increase the risk of insider threats and exposure to external
  attacks, potentially leading to data breaches and service disruptions. Compliance
  with standards such as NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001 mandates stringent access controls
  to safeguard sensitive data and maintain operational integrity.
description: This rule checks if instance templates are configured with the minimal
  necessary IAM roles required for DR operations. Ensure that roles assigned to instance
  templates do not exceed the permissions necessary for their intended function. Verify
  configurations through IAM policy review and use GCP tools to audit permissions.
  Remediation involves adjusting IAM policies to remove unnecessary roles while validating
  functionality remains intact.
