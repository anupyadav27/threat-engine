requirement: Resilience DR Source Encryption At Rest Cmek Where Supported

severity: high
title: Ensure CMEK for Resilience DR Source Encryption at Rest
rationale: Using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting data at rest
  in Compute Engine enhances security by giving you control over key management. This
  reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, and helps meet compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring data is protected with user-managed
  keys.
description: This rule checks if Compute Engine instances used as sources for disaster
  recovery (DR) have their data encrypted at rest using CMEK where supported. Verify
  by ensuring the encryption key settings of the instances are configured to use user-managed
  keys. Remediate by updating the instance settings to specify a CMEK in the relevant
  Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) key ring.
