title: Ensure Compute Image is Signed and Verified
rationale: Unsigned or unverified images pose security risks as they may contain malicious
  code, leading to compromised instances and data breaches. Ensuring images are signed
  and verified enhances trust and integrity in your compute environment, aligning
  with compliance frameworks that mandate secure software delivery practices.
description: This rule checks that compute images used in the environment are cryptographically
  signed and verified. Images should be signed using a trusted certificate authority
  to ensure authenticity and integrity. Administrators can verify image signatures
  via GCP's Container Analysis API. Remediation involves signing images with a trusted
  key and configuring GCP to verify this signature before deployment.
