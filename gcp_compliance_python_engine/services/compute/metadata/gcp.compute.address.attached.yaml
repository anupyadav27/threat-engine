title: Ensure Static IP Addresses Are Attached to Resources
rationale: Unattached static IP addresses may lead to unexpected billing and may be
  unintentionally left unused, posing a security risk if mistakenly allocated to unauthorized
  resources. Ensuring IP addresses are attached helps maintain an accurate inventory
  of network resources and supports compliance with network configuration management
  best practices.
description: This rule checks for any static IP addresses in Google Cloud Platform's
  Compute Engine that are not attached to any resources, such as virtual machines
  or load balancers. Unattached IP addresses should be reviewed and either attached
  to the necessary resources or released if no longer needed. This can be verified
  through the Google Cloud Console under VPC Network > External IP addresses or using
  the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves attaching the IP to an appropriate
  resource or releasing it to avoid unnecessary charges and potential misuse.
