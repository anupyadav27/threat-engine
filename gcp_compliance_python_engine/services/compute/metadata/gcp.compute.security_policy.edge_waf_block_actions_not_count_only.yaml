title: Ensure Edge WAF Policies Enforce Block Actions
rationale: Implementing block actions in your Edge WAF policies is crucial for actively
  preventing malicious traffic from reaching your applications. While 'count' actions
  allow monitoring and analysis of potential threats, they do not stop attacks in
  real-time, increasing the risk of data breaches and service disruptions. Organizations
  must enforce block actions to comply with security standards and mitigate threats
  effectively.
description: This rule checks that security policies in Google Cloud Platform's Edge
  WAF are configured to enforce block actions, rather than just logging or counting
  suspicious activity. Without active blocking, potential threats are only monitored,
  which does not prevent them from causing harm. To verify, check the security policies
  in your GCP account to ensure that they include rules with action set to 'block'.
  If only 'count' actions are present, update the policy to enforce blocking for critical
  threat vectors. This ensures compliance with security best practices and reduces
  the risk of successful attacks.
