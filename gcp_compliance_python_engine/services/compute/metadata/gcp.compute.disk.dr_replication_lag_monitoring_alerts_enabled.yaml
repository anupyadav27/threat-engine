title: Enable Monitoring Alerts for DR Replication Lag on Disks
rationale: Monitoring DR replication lag is crucial for ensuring data consistency
  and availability in disaster recovery scenarios. Without timely alerts, businesses
  risk data loss or corruption, which can impact service continuity and violate compliance
  mandates such as ISO 27001 and SOC2. Proactive monitoring helps mitigate these risks
  by allowing prompt corrective actions.
description: This rule checks if alerts are configured for monitoring replication
  lag of disks in disaster recovery setups on GCP. Ensure that you have set up Cloud
  Monitoring alerts to notify you of any lag beyond acceptable thresholds. Verify
  by accessing the Cloud Monitoring dashboard and reviewing alert policies related
  to disk replication metrics. Remediation involves configuring alert policies to
  track relevant metrics and setting appropriate thresholds to trigger notifications.
