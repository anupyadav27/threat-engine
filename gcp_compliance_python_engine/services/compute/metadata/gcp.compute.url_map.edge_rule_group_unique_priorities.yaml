title: Ensure Unique Priorities for Edge Rule Groups in URL Maps
rationale: Unique priorities for edge rule groups within a URL map are crucial to
  preventing conflicts and ensuring predictable routing behavior. This reduces the
  risk of misrouting traffic, which can lead to application downtime, loss of service
  availability, and potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, maintaining
  unique priorities aligns with regulatory requirements for system integrity and availability.
description: This rule checks that each edge rule group within a Google Cloud Platform
  URL map has a unique priority. Edge rule groups with non-unique priorities can cause
  conflicts in traffic routing, leading to unexpected behavior. To verify, review
  the URL map configuration and ensure each rule group has a distinct priority. Remediation
  involves adjusting the priorities so that no two edge rule groups share the same
  value, ensuring proper traffic flow and application functionality.
