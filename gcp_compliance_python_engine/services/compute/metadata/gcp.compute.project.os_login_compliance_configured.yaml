severity: low
title: Ensure OS Login is Enabled for Project Compliance
rationale: Enabling OS Login enhances security by centralizing user management via
  IAM, reducing the risk of unauthorized access through SSH keys. It aids in compliance
  with security frameworks by ensuring consistent access control and audit logging
  across instances, providing traceability and accountability for access activities.
description: This rule checks if OS Login is configured for all VM instances in the
  project. OS Login enforces IAM-based user and SSH key management, improving security
  and simplifying access control. To verify, ensure 'enable-oslogin' metadata is set
  to 'true' at the project level. Remediation involves updating project metadata to
  include 'enable-oslogin=true' and verifying IAM roles and permissions for users.
