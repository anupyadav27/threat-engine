title: Ensure Compute Disk Network TLS Min Version is 1.2
rationale: Enforcing a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for GCP Compute Disk network communication
  is crucial to protect data in transit from being intercepted or tampered with by
  attackers. This enhances data integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk of
  man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS
  and NIST SP 800-52.
description: This rule checks that all network communications involving GCP Compute
  Disks enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2. To verify, ensure that TLS policies
  are configured correctly in your network security settings. Remediation involves
  updating any outdated configurations to specify TLS 1.2 as the minimum version to
  secure data transfers, particularly for sensitive or regulated information.
