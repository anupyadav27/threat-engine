title: Enable Confidential Computing for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling Confidential Computing on GCP Compute Instances enhances data
  protection by encrypting data in use, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to
  sensitive information during processing. This is crucial for meeting regulatory
  compliance and safeguarding intellectual property from advanced threats and insider
  attacks.
description: This rule checks if Confidential Computing is enabled for GCP Compute
  Instances, which ensures that data remains encrypted in memory during processing
  using secure enclaves. To verify, ensure that instances are configured with the
  Confidential VM option enabled. Remediation involves modifying instance settings
  to activate Confidential Computing, which can be done via the GCP Console or the
  CLI.
