requirement: DR Backup Immutable Or Worm Enabled Where Supported

domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure Snapshots Have Immutable or WORM Backups Enabled
rationale: Enabling immutable or Write Once Read Many (WORM) backups for snapshots
  prevents accidental or malicious data modification. This is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and ensuring that disaster recovery processes can rely on untampered
  backups. It also supports compliance with regulations that require data retention
  and protection against unauthorized changes.
description: This rule verifies that snapshots in GCP have immutable or WORM backup
  settings enabled where supported. Enabling these settings ensures that once data
  is written, it cannot be altered, providing a secure backup solution. Administrators
  should configure snapshot settings in the GCP Console or via the API to enable immutability
  where available. Regular audits and configuration checks should be conducted to
  ensure continuous compliance.
