title: Enable Network Flow Logs for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling network flow logs for compute instances is crucial for monitoring
  and analyzing traffic patterns, which helps in identifying unusual activities that
  might indicate security threats. It also aids in meeting compliance requirements
  by providing visibility into network operations, supporting audits, and forensic
  investigations.
description: This rule checks if network flow logging is enabled for Google Cloud
  Compute instances. Network flow logs capture metadata about the IP traffic going
  to and from VM instances, which is vital for security analysis and operational oversight.
  To enable, configure VPC Flow Logs for the relevant subnets in each VPC network.
  This can be done via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI by setting the flow
  logs configuration to 'enabled'.
