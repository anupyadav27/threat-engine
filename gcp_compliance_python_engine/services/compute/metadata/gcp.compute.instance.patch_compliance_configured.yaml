title: Ensure Patch Compliance Configured for Compute Instances
rationale: Unpatched virtual machine instances can expose your cloud environment to
  security vulnerabilities, leading to potential data breaches, service disruptions,
  or unauthorized access. This could result in significant business impact, including
  financial losses and damage to reputation. Ensuring patch compliance is also a critical
  requirement for meeting various regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if patch compliance is configured for GCP Compute Engine
  instances. It verifies that instances are set to automatically apply security patches,
  ensuring they are protected against known vulnerabilities. To configure patch compliance,
  enable 'OS patch management' in the Google Cloud Console and ensure that the 'Automatic
  patching' option is set to 'Enabled'. Remediation involves auditing your instance
  configurations and adjusting them to meet compliance requirements.
