title: Ensure HTTPS Load Balancer Configured for Compute Instances
rationale: Configuring an HTTPS Load Balancer for compute instances ensures that data
  transmitted over the network is encrypted, protecting against interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially
  for sensitive information. Additionally, using HTTPS aligns with compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, reducing legal and financial risks.
description: This rule verifies that compute instances are behind an HTTPS Load Balancer,
  which ensures all traffic is encrypted using TLS. To check this configuration, ensure
  that the target instances are part of a backend service linked to an HTTPS forwarding
  rule. Remediation involves setting up an HTTPS Load Balancer with a valid SSL certificate
  and associating it with the relevant backend services and instances. This configuration
  not only secures data in transit but also improves application availability and
  scalability.
