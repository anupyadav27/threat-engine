title: Enforce Least Privilege for Network Roles in Instance Templates
rationale: Assigning least privilege roles for network remediation in instance templates
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It reduces the attack
  surface by ensuring that users and services have only the necessary permissions,
  aligning with compliance requirements such as least privilege principles in NIST
  and ISO 27001. This approach mitigates the potential impact of compromised credentials
  or insider threats, protecting sensitive network configurations and data.
description: This rule checks that network remediation roles assigned to instance
  templates do not exceed the minimum permissions required. Review and adjust IAM
  policies to ensure roles are designed according to the principle of least privilege.
  Verify that no overly permissive roles are attached to instance templates, and modify
  them to limit access to only the actions necessary for remediation tasks. Regular
  audits and policy reviews should be conducted to maintain compliance and security
  posture.
