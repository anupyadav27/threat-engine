title: Firewall Rules Require Network Exception Approvals
rationale: Requiring approvals for network exceptions minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. It ensures that firewall rule changes are vetted
  for security impact, aligning with compliance needs such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001,
  which mandate strict access controls and auditing. This practice helps prevent accidental
  or malicious misconfigurations that could expose sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that any exceptions to standard network access control
  policies in GCP firewall rules have documented approvals. Specifically, it ensures
  that any rule allowing traffic from less secure networks or any 'allow' rules with
  a broad IP range have been reviewed and approved by a security team. To verify,
  review the audit logs for evidence of approval and ensure that all firewall changes
  are tracked in a change management system. Remedy any unapproved rules by conducting
  a security review and obtaining necessary approvals or removing the rule.
