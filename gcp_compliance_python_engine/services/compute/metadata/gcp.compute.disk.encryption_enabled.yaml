title: Ensure Compute Engine Disks Have Encryption Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption for Compute Engine disks protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access and data breaches. It is essential for maintaining confidentiality
  and integrity of data-at-rest, and is often a requirement for regulatory compliance
  frameworks such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Unencrypted disks can expose data to risk
  if compromised, leading to potential financial loss and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all Compute Engine disks have encryption enabled,
  either with Google-managed or customer-supplied encryption keys. To check, navigate
  to the Google Cloud Console, select 'Compute Engine', and review disk settings for
  encryption status. Remediation involves configuring disk encryption during disk
  creation or updating existing disks to use encryption keys. Utilize customer-managed
  keys for enhanced security control.
