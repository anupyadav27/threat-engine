severity: critical
title: Ensure Public Access is Disabled for Compute Snapshots
rationale: Snapshots containing system and user data, if exposed publicly, can lead
  to unauthorized data access, potentially resulting in data breaches, non-compliance
  with data protection regulations, and reputational damage. Securing snapshots is
  essential to prevent malicious actors from exploiting sensitive information and
  to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of critical business data.
description: This rule checks for Google Cloud Compute snapshots that are configured
  with public access permissions. Snapshots should not be publicly accessible as they
  may contain sensitive information. To verify, review the snapshot's IAM policies
  and ensure that no public users (i.e., 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers') have
  access. Remediation involves updating the IAM policy to restrict access to only
  necessary and authorized accounts or groups.
