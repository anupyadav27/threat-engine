title: Ensure Cross-Region Disk Replication is Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting cross-region replicated disks safeguards sensitive data from
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches during disaster recovery scenarios.
  This practice mitigates risks of data exposure when data is transferred across regions
  and helps meet compliance requirements such as GDPR, which mandates data protection
  during transit and at rest.
description: This rule checks that all cross-region replicated disks in GCP are encrypted
  at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption
  keys (GMEK). Verify that the 'diskEncryptionKey' is specified in the disk's configuration.
  To remediate, enable encryption on disks by setting up CMEK or GMEK in the Compute
  Engine settings, ensuring that the 'diskEncryptionKey' is correctly configured to
  protect the data.
