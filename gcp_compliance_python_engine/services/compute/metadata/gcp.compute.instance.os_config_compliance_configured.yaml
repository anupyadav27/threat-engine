title: Ensure OS Config Compliance on GCP Compute Instances
rationale: Configuring OS Config Compliance on instances is vital to maintaining a
  secure and up-to-date cloud environment. It helps mitigate security risks by ensuring
  that operating systems are patched, configurations are compliant with security policies,
  and any deviation is promptly addressed. This is crucial for meeting regulatory
  requirements like PCI-DSS and SOC2, which mandate regular updates and configuration
  management.
description: This rule checks if OS Config Compliance is configured on GCP Compute
  Instances, which involves setting up the OS Config agent to manage patch compliance,
  configuration compliance, and software inventory. To verify, ensure the OS Config
  API is enabled and the agent is installed and running on each instance. Remediation
  involves enabling the OS Config API, installing the agent, and configuring it to
  report compliance status. This ensures that instances adhere to organizational security
  policies and compliance frameworks.
