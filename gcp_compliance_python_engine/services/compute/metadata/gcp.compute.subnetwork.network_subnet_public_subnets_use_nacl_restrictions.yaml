service: compute
resource: subnetwork
requirement: Network Subnet Public Subnets Use Nacl Restrictions
scope: compute.subnetwork.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: critical
title: Enforce Network ACLs on Public Subnets
rationale: Public subnets without proper Network ACLs pose significant security risks,
  as they can allow unauthorized access to resources within the network. This can
  lead to data breaches, unauthorized data exfiltration, and potential non-compliance
  with regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and GDPR which mandate strict access
  controls. Ensuring that public subnets are protected by Network ACLs mitigates these
  risks by controlling inbound and outbound traffic effectively.
description: This rule checks that all public subnets in your GCP environment have
  Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) applied to restrict unauthorized access. Network
  ACLs should be configured to allow only the necessary traffic to and from your public
  subnets. To verify, ensure that each public subnet has an ACL applied with rules
  that define explicit allow and deny permissions. Remediation involves creating or
  updating ACLs to include rules that limit exposure to critical resources by denying
  unnecessary traffic.
