title: Ensure VM Instances Have Secure Boot Enabled
rationale: Enabling Secure Boot on VM instances minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  code execution during the boot process, protecting against rootkits and low-level
  malware. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the
  system's boot sequence, thus ensuring compliance with security standards like NIST
  and ISO 27001, which require strong boot-time security controls.
description: 'This rule checks if Secure Boot is enabled for Google Compute Engine
  VM instances. Secure Boot is a feature that helps prevent malicious software and
  unauthorized operating systems from loading during the system start-up process.
  To verify, ensure the VM instance''s boot configuration includes ''secureBoot: true''.
  If not enabled, modify the instance configuration by setting the secure boot option
  in the Shielded VM settings. This action enhances the security posture by enforcing
  trusted boot paths.'
