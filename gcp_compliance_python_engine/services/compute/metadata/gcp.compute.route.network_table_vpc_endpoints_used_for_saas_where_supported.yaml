title: Use VPC Endpoints for SaaS in Network Routes
rationale: Using VPC endpoints for SaaS applications reduces exposure to the public
  internet, minimizing the risk of data interception and unauthorized access. This
  is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data protection controls.
description: This rule checks whether VPC endpoints are utilized in routing tables
  for SaaS applications where supported. Ensuring that traffic to SaaS applications
  is routed through VPC endpoints can enhance security by keeping traffic within the
  managed Google Cloud network. To verify, inspect the routing tables for routes pointing
  to VPC endpoints for SaaS, ensuring they are correctly configured. Remediation includes
  setting up VPC endpoints and updating routing tables to leverage these endpoints
  for SaaS traffic.
