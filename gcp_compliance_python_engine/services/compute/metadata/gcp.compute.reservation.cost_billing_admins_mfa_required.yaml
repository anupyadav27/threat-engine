requirement: Cost Billing Admins MFA Required

subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Enforce MFA for Cost Billing Admins on Compute Reservations
rationale: Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Cost Billing Admins mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access to financial resources and sensitive configurations.
  Without MFA, attackers with stolen credentials can access and manipulate billing
  data, leading to financial loss and compliance violations under frameworks like
  PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if Cost Billing Admins managing compute reservations
  have MFA enabled. Ensure that all accounts with billing access are secured with
  two-step verification by navigating to 'IAM & Admin' > 'IAM', selecting the relevant
  account, and enabling MFA. Remediation involves configuring MFA in the Google Account
  settings and enforcing it through 'Access Context Manager' policies.
