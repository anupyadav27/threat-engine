title: Ensure Network Policies Are Applied to GCP Firewall Rules
rationale: Implementing network policies in GCP firewall rules is crucial for defining
  and enforcing traffic ingress and egress controls. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and lateral movement within the network. Properly configured
  network policies help meet compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001,
  thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks if network policies are applied to GCP firewall rules,
  ensuring that only authorized traffic can access network resources. Verify that
  all firewall rules have associated network policies specifying ingress and egress
  traffic controls. Remediation involves reviewing each firewall rule and applying
  appropriate network policies to restrict access based on business and security requirements.
  Adjust or create firewall rules with network policies using the GCP Console or gcloud
  command-line tool.
