title: Ensure Compute Images Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
rationale: Using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to encrypt compute images
  provides greater control over data protection and access management, mitigating
  risks of unauthorized access and data breaches. This practice is crucial for meeting
  compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate strong encryption
  measures to protect sensitive data at rest.
description: This rule checks whether Google Compute Engine images are encrypted with
  Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure the image's 'encryptionKey'
  parameter is set to a valid CMEK key. Remediation involves creating or using an
  existing Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) key and specifying it during the image
  creation or update process. This enhances security by allowing key rotation and
  revocation, thus maintaining strict data governance.
