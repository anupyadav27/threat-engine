subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: medium
title: Ensure Snapshots for DR Are Stored in Private Buckets
rationale: Storing backup snapshots in private destinations minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead to significant financial and
  reputational damage. It ensures compliance with data protection regulations by preventing
  public exposure of sensitive data stored in backups. This practice supports business
  continuity by securing critical recovery data.
description: This rule checks whether Compute Engine snapshots used for disaster recovery
  (DR) are stored in Cloud Storage buckets with private access settings. Public access
  to these buckets should be disabled to protect sensitive backup data. To verify,
  review the bucket's IAM policy and ensure 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
  are not granted access. Remediation involves updating the bucket's permissions to
  restrict access to specific service accounts or users who require it.
