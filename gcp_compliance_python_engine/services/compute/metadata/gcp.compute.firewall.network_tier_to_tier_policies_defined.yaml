title: Ensure Network Tier Policies Are Defined for Firewall Rules
rationale: Defining network tier policies for firewall rules in GCP helps ensure that
  traffic flows are adequately managed between different network tiers, reducing the
  risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice is essential
  for maintaining robust network segmentation, which mitigates lateral movement by
  attackers and helps in achieving compliance with standards that require network
  isolation and access control, such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if network tier-to-tier policies are defined for all
  firewall rules within GCP's Compute Engine. Proper configuration requires specifying
  which network tiers (Standard or Premium) can communicate with each other, ensuring
  traffic is only allowed where explicitly permitted. Verification involves reviewing
  the firewall rules and ensuring that tier policies are accurately configured. Remediation
  includes updating firewall configurations to include explicit tier policies, using
  the GCP Console or gcloud CLI, to prevent unintended traffic flows.
