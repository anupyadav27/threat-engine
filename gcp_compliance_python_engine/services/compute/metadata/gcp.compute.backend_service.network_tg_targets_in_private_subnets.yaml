title: Ensure Backend Service Targets Are in Private Subnets
rationale: Configuring backend services to target instances within private subnets
  reduces exposure to potential external threats and unauthorized access. This setup
  is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with network
  security standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001. Failure to properly isolate backend
  services can lead to data breaches and compromise service integrity.
description: This rule checks that all network traffic targets for backend services
  are located within private subnets, preventing direct exposure to the public internet.
  Verify configurations by ensuring that backend instances are assigned private IPs
  in VPC subnets. Remediation involves modifying backend services to ensure only private
  subnets are used, adjusting the network configuration in the GCP console under VPC
  settings.
