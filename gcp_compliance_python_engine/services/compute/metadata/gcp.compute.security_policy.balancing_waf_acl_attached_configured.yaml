title: Ensure WAF ACLs are Attached and Configured on Load Balancers
rationale: Proper configuration of Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control Lists
  (ACLs) on load balancers is crucial to protect web applications from common threats
  such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Failing to configure these ACLs
  can lead to security vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive data and potentially violating
  compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and GDPR.
description: This rule checks whether a WAF ACL is both attached and configured on
  Google Cloud Load Balancers within the security policies. It verifies the presence
  of security policies that include WAF rules tailored to the application's threat
  model. Remediation involves reviewing and updating security policies to include
  appropriate WAF ACLs, ensuring they are actively blocking or mitigating known vulnerabilities.
