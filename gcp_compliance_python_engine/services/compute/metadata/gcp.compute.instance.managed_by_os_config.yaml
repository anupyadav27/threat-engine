title: Ensure Compute Instances are Managed by OS Config
rationale: Managing compute instances with OS Config ensures centralized control over
  configuration, compliance, and updates, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities
  due to misconfiguration or outdated software. It provides a consistent approach
  to enforcing security policies and can help meet compliance requirements by ensuring
  instances are aligned with organizational security standards.
description: This rule checks if GCP Compute Engine instances are managed by OS Config,
  which facilitates automated patch management, configuration compliance, and software
  management. To verify, ensure that the OS Config agent is installed and configured
  on each instance. Remediation involves installing the OS Config agent and enabling
  the necessary API permissions for the project to allow management through OS Config.
