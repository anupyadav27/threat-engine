title: Restrict Egress Traffic with Network ACLs on GCP Firewall
rationale: Restricting egress traffic in your Google Cloud environment is crucial
  to prevent data exfiltration and mitigate the risk of unauthorized external communications.
  Open egress rules can expose your network to potential threats, including data breaches
  and regulatory non-compliance, affecting business continuity and reputation.
description: This rule checks that egress rules in GCP firewall configurations are
  restricted to only necessary IP ranges and ports. To verify, review firewall settings
  in the Google Cloud Console to ensure no overly permissive egress rules exist. Remediation
  involves updating firewall rules to limit outbound traffic to specific, trusted
  IP addresses and ports, aligning with least privilege principles.
