title: Ensure Subnet Route Table Association in GCP
rationale: Associating a subnet with a route table is critical for defining how network
  traffic is directed within your GCP environment. Without proper association, there
  could be a risk of unauthorized access or data exfiltration as traffic routes may
  not comply with security policies. This is essential for maintaining compliance
  with regulatory frameworks that require stringent network access controls.
description: This rule checks that each Google Cloud subnetwork is associated with
  a route table, ensuring that traffic is routed according to defined security policies.
  To verify, review the subnet configurations in the GCP Console under VPC Network
  settings to ensure route tables are assigned correctly. Remediation involves associating
  the missing route table with the subnetwork to ensure all ingress and egress traffic
  is appropriately controlled.
