title: Restrict Default Security Group Access
rationale: Unrestricted firewall rules in the default security group can expose GCP
  resources to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and service
  disruptions. Organizations often underestimate the risk posed by default configurations,
  which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized entry into the network.
  Adhering to security best practices and compliance standards, such as NIST and PCI-DSS,
  requires limiting network access to only necessary services.
description: This rule checks that the default security group in GCP Compute Engine
  does not allow overly permissive ingress and egress traffic, particularly from the
  internet. Firewall rules should be configured to deny non-essential traffic and
  limit access to specific IP addresses or ranges as needed. To remediate, review
  and modify the default firewall rules to ensure they align with the principle of
  least privilege, allowing only required traffic through. Verification can be done
  by inspecting the firewall rule configurations in the Google Cloud Console or via
  gcloud CLI.
