title: Ensure Edge Regex Set is Defined for URL Maps
rationale: Defining an edge regex set for URL maps in GCP is crucial to controlling
  traffic routing accurately. Without it, misrouted traffic could lead to security
  vulnerabilities, such as exposure to unauthorized access or data leakage. Proper
  configuration helps in meeting compliance requirements like PCI-DSS by ensuring
  data flows through secure and verified paths.
description: This rule checks that the edge regex set for URL maps is not empty, ensuring
  that traffic is routed according to defined policies. To verify, inspect the URL
  map configuration in the GCP Console and ensure that a regex set is specified for
  edge routing. Remediation involves updating the URL map to include a comprehensive
  regex set that aligns with your routing and security policies, preventing potential
  misrouting or unauthorized access.
