title: Ensure Secure Cipher Policies for Network Listeners
rationale: Using insecure cipher policies for network listeners can expose sensitive
  data to interception and tampering, leading to data breaches and non-compliance
  with security standards. Secure cipher configurations are crucial to protect data
  in transit, maintain customer trust, and meet regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS
  and NIST guidelines.
description: This rule checks that all forwarding rules in the GCP Compute service
  use secure cipher policies for network listeners. Insecure ciphers can be vulnerable
  to attacks like BEAST, POODLE, or Logjam. To verify, inspect the TLS policies associated
  with forwarding rules and ensure they only support strong, secure ciphers. Remediation
  involves updating the cipher policies to exclude weak ciphers and protocols, aligning
  with the latest security standards.
