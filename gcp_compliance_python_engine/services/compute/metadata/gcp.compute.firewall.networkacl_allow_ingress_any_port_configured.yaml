rule_id: gcp.compute.firewall.networkacl_allow_ingress_any_port_configured
service: compute
resource: firewall
requirement: Networkacl Allow Ingress Any Port Configured
scope: compute.firewall.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Restrict Ingress Traffic to Specific Ports on GCP Firewall
rationale: Allowing ingress traffic from any port increases the attack surface and
  exposes the network to potential threats such as unauthorized access and data breaches.
  Limiting allowed ports helps in meeting compliance requirements by ensuring only
  necessary services are accessible, reducing the risk of exploitation.
description: This rule checks for Google Cloud Platform firewall configurations that
  permit ingress traffic from any port. It is crucial to restrict this setting to
  only necessary ports to minimize exposure to potential threats. Verify by reviewing
  firewall rules in the GCP Console or via gcloud command-line tool. Remediate by
  updating the firewall rules to allow traffic only on specific, required ports and
  implementing strict access controls.
