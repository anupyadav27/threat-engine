service: compute
resource: security_policy
requirement: Network Anomaly Destinations Encrypted
scope: compute.security_policy.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Network Anomaly Destinations Use Encrypted Channels
rationale: Encrypting network anomaly destinations protects against unauthorized data
  interception and tampering, which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
  This encryption is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of
  data in transit, especially for organizations handling sensitive or regulated information.
description: This rule verifies that all network anomaly destinations defined in GCP
  Compute Engine security policies use encrypted channels such as TLS for data transmission.
  To ensure compliance, review security policy configurations to confirm that all
  destinations are set to accept only secure, encrypted connections. Remediation involves
  updating security policies to enforce encryption and confirming that all endpoints
  support secure protocols.
