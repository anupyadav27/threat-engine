title: Ensure HTTPS Redirect is Configured for ALB URL Maps
rationale: Configuring HTTPS redirects for Application Load Balancer URL maps ensures
  that all traffic to your web applications is encrypted, protecting sensitive data
  from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is essential for maintaining
  data confidentiality, integrity, and securing your applications against potential
  threats. It also helps in meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS which
  mandate secure transmission of data.
description: This rule checks if URL maps in Google Cloud's Application Load Balancer
  have HTTPS redirects configured. Without this configuration, traffic can be transmitted
  over insecure HTTP, exposing it to interception. To verify, inspect each URL map
  configuration for HTTPS redirect settings. Remediation involves updating the URL
  map to enforce HTTPS by setting up appropriate redirect response configurations
  within the load balancing settings.
