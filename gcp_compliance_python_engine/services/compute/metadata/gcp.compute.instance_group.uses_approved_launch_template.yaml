title: Ensure Instance Groups Use Approved Launch Templates
rationale: Using approved launch templates for instance groups ensures that all instances
  adhere to organizational security standards, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations
  that could lead to vulnerabilities. This practice helps maintain consistency across
  deployments, reducing the attack surface and supporting compliance with regulations
  like PCI-DSS, which require stringent control over system configurations.
description: This rule checks if all instance groups within your GCP environment utilize
  launch templates that have been approved by your organization's security team. Approved
  launch templates contain predefined configurations that meet security policies,
  such as specific network settings, firewall rules, and instance metadata configurations.
  To verify compliance, review the launch template IDs associated with your instance
  groups and compare them against the list of approved templates. If discrepancies
  are found, update the instance group to use an approved launch template, ensuring
  it matches security requirements.
