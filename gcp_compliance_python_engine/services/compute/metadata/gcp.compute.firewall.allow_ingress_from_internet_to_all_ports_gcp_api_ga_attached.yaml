requirement: Allow Ingress From Internet To All Ports Gcp API Ga Attached
scope: compute.firewall.security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Restrict Ingress from Internet to All Ports on GCP Firewall
rationale: Allowing unrestricted ingress from the internet to all ports poses significant
  security risks, including potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and exposure
  to attacks such as DDoS. This configuration can lead to non-compliance with standards
  like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require controlled access to protect sensitive
  data.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules that allow ingress traffic from the
  internet on all ports, which can expose resources to unauthorized access. Verify
  that firewall rules specify limited source IP ranges and only open necessary ports.
  Remediation involves restricting ingress rules to specific IP addresses and limiting
  ports to those essential for operations. Use the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to review
  and update firewall rules accordingly.
