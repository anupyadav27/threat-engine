title: Ensure Attached IP Addresses Are Properly Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of attached IP addresses is critical to maintaining
  network security and preventing unauthorized access or data leakage. Misconfigured
  IP addresses can lead to exposure of internal services to the internet, increasing
  the risk of attacks and non-compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that all attached IP addresses in Google Cloud Platform
  are correctly configured according to best practices. It ensures that IP addresses
  are not unnecessarily exposed to the public internet and are restricted to specific
  services or resources that require them. Verification involves reviewing the network
  interface settings on instances to ensure IP addresses are appropriately allocated
  and configured. Remediation may include re-assigning IP addresses to private networks
  or adjusting firewall rules to limit exposure.
