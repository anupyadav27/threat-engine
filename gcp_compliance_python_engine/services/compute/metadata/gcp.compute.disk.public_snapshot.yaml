title: Ensure Compute Disk Snapshots Are Not Publicly Accessible
rationale: Publicly accessible disk snapshots can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  users, leading to potential data breaches. This can result in financial loss, reputational
  damage, and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring snapshots
  are private mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and enhances the security
  posture of your cloud environment.
description: This rule checks if any Compute Engine disk snapshots are publicly accessible.
  Public snapshots can be accessed by anyone on the internet, increasing the risk
  of data exposure. To verify, review the 'isPublic' property of each snapshot in
  the GCP Console or use gcloud commands. Remediation involves modifying the snapshot
  permissions to restrict access, ensuring only authorized users can view or restore
  them.
