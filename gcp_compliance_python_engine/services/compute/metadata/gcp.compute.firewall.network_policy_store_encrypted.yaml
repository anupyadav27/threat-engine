rule_id: gcp.compute.firewall.network_policy_store_encrypted
service: compute
resource: firewall
requirement: Network Policy Store Encrypted
scope: compute.firewall.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Network Policy Store is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting network policy data at rest protects sensitive configuration
  data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of network policies, which can prevent unauthorized
  network traffic and ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR
  and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if the network policy store in GCP's Compute Engine
  Firewall is encrypted at rest. Verify that encryption mechanisms are enabled for
  all firewall configurations by examining the firewall's metadata and ensuring that
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) are utilized where applicable. Remediation
  involves configuring encryption settings in the GCP Console or using Terraform to
  enforce CMEK for enhanced security.
