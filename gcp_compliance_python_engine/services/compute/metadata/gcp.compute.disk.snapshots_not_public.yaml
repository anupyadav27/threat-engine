title: Ensure Compute Disk Snapshots Are Not Publicly Accessible
rationale: Publicly accessible disk snapshots expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  users, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and PCI-DSS. Unauthorized access could lead to data leaks, financial
  loss, and reputational damage to the organization.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Platform Compute Disk snapshots are
  publicly accessible. It ensures that no snapshots are set to have 'allUsers' or
  'allAuthenticatedUsers' in their access control lists. To verify, review the IAM
  policies associated with each snapshot and remove any public access entries. Ensure
  that only necessary and authorized personnel have access to these snapshots.
