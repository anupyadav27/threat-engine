title: Validate and Own VPN Tunnel Network CGW IP Addresses
rationale: Ensuring the VPN tunnel's network Customer Gateway (CGW) IP addresses are
  valid and owned by your organization mitigates risks of unauthorized access and
  data breaches. It prevents misconfigurations that could lead to traffic interception
  or redirection by malicious actors. This is crucial for maintaining secure and compliant
  network architecture as required by standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that the IP addresses configured for the VPN tunnel's
  CGW are valid and owned by your organization. Verify that these IPs are part of
  your allocated address space and not mistakenly using external or public IPs that
  could expose your network to unauthorized access. Remediation involves auditing
  your VPN configurations, updating any incorrect IPs, and ensuring they are registered
  and controlled by your organization.
