title: Ensure SSL Policies Avoid Deprecated Protocols
rationale: Using deprecated SSL protocols can expose your systems to vulnerabilities
  such as man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to data breaches and loss
  of customer trust. Compliance with industry standards and regulations, like PCI-DSS
  and NIST, often requires the use of secure protocols to protect sensitive data in
  transit.
description: This rule checks for SSL policies in Google Cloud Platform's Compute
  service that are configured with deprecated SSL protocols. Deprecated protocols
  lack modern security features and are more susceptible to exploitation. To mitigate
  this risk, update your SSL policies to use only supported and secure protocols such
  as TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Verification can be done by reviewing the SSL policy settings
  in the GCP Console or using the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves modifying
  the SSL policy to exclude deprecated protocols.
