title: Ensure Compute Disk Snapshots are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting disk snapshots is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
  access, especially in backup and recovery scenarios. Unencrypted snapshots can lead
  to data breaches, exposing critical business information and potentially violating
  compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. By enforcing encryption, organizations
  mitigate risks associated with data theft and ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks whether snapshots of Compute Engine disks are encrypted
  using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption keys.
  To verify, inspect the encryption status of existing disk snapshots in the GCP Console
  or via gcloud CLI. Remediation involves enabling encryption by specifying a CMEK
  during snapshot creation or ensuring current snapshots use Google-managed keys.
  Regular reviews and updates to encryption keys are recommended to maintain security
  posture.
