title: Ensure TLS for DR Replication Encryption In Transit for Disks
rationale: Encrypting data in transit using TLS during disaster recovery (DR) replication
  is crucial to protect sensitive information from interception and unauthorized access.
  This is essential to mitigate the risks of data breaches and ensure compliance with
  standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate encrypted data transfers. Failure
  to do so can lead to significant reputational damage and legal penalties.
description: This rule checks whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enabled for
  encrypting data in transit during DR replication of Compute Engine disks. Ensure
  that TLS is configured by verifying the encryption settings in the Google Cloud
  Console or via the gcloud command-line tool. To remediate, update the disk replication
  settings to enforce TLS encryption when data is transferred between data centers.
