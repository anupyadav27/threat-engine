title: Ensure Edge IP CIDRs Are Valid and Minimized
rationale: Proper configuration of IP address CIDR ranges ensures that resources are
  not exposed to unnecessary network traffic, reducing the attack surface and preventing
  unauthorized access. Minimizing CIDR ranges helps in adhering to the principle of
  least privilege and can mitigate risks of data breaches and unauthorized access,
  which are critical for regulatory compliance with frameworks like PCI-DSS and SOC
  2.
description: This rule checks that the CIDR ranges assigned to edge IP addresses in
  GCP are valid, non-overlapping, and as narrow as possible. It involves verifying
  current CIDR configurations against access needs and adjusting them to allow only
  the required IP ranges. Remediation includes reviewing the IP address configurations
  in the GCP Console under 'VPC network' settings and using 'gcloud' commands to update
  CIDR ranges, ensuring they are appropriately limited to necessary IPs only.
