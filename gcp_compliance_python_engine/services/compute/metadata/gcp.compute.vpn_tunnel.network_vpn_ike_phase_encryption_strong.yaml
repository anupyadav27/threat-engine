title: Ensure Strong Encryption for VPN IKE Phase
rationale: Using strong encryption algorithms for IKE phases ensures data integrity
  and confidentiality during VPN communication. Weak encryption can expose data to
  interception and unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Strong encryption is vital for protecting
  sensitive business data and maintaining trust with customers and partners.
description: This rule checks that the VPN tunnel uses strong encryption algorithms,
  such as AES-256, for IKE phase 1 and phase 2. Proper configuration mitigates risks
  of data interception and unauthorized access. Verify configurations in the GCP Console
  under VPN configurations or through the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves
  updating the IKE phase settings to use strong encryption, ensuring both phases employ
  recommended algorithms.
