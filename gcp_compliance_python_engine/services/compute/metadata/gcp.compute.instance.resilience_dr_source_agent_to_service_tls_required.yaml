title: Enforce TLS for Resilience DR Source Agent Communications
rationale: Requiring TLS for communications between the Resilience DR source agent
  and service ensures data integrity and confidentiality during transmission. Without
  TLS, sensitive data could be exposed to interception or tampering, posing a risk
  to operational continuity and potentially leading to non-compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if TLS encryption is enforced for communications between
  the Resilience DR source agent and its corresponding service on GCP instances. To
  verify, ensure that all network traffic between these components uses TLS by configuring
  the agent and service endpoints to support HTTPS connections. Remediation involves
  updating the instance configurations and network policies to mandate TLS usage for
  these communications.
