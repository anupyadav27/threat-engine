title: Ensure Snapshots of Compute Disk are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting snapshots of Compute Engine disks is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential exposure. This measure reduces the risk
  of data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance violations with
  standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. Encryption at rest ensures that even
  if physical security is compromised, data remains unreadable and secure.
description: This rule checks whether snapshots of Compute Engine disks are encrypted
  using customer-managed or Google-managed encryption keys. Unencrypted snapshots
  can lead to data exposure if accessed by unauthorized users. To verify, ensure that
  all disk snapshots are created with encryption enabled by configuring the appropriate
  encryption keys in the Cloud Console or via the gcloud CLI. Remediate by updating
  existing snapshots to apply encryption and setting organization policies to enforce
  encryption on all new snapshots.
