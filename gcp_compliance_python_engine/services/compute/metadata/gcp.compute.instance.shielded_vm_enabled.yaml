severity: low
title: Ensure Shielded VM is Enabled for Compute Instances
rationale: Shielded VMs provide verifiable integrity of virtual machines, protecting
  against rootkits and bootkits, which can compromise the integrity of your instances.
  Enabling Shielded VM safeguards against unauthorized alterations and enhances compliance
  with security frameworks like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, mitigating risks of data breaches
  and unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks if Shielded VM features are enabled on Google Compute
  Engine instances, ensuring that vTPM, integrity monitoring, and secure boot are
  active. To verify, navigate to the VM instance settings in the GCP console and confirm
  that Shielded VM options are enabled. Remediation involves editing the instance
  settings and enabling these features, or recreating the instance with Shielded VM
  enabled.
