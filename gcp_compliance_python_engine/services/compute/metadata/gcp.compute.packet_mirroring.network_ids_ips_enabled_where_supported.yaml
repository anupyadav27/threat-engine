title: Enable Network IDs and IPs in Packet Mirroring
rationale: Enabling network IDs and IPs in packet mirroring is crucial for ensuring
  that mirrored traffic is accurately tagged and can be properly analyzed. Without
  this, there is a risk of incomplete traffic analysis, which can lead to undetected
  anomalies or breaches. This is particularly important for organizations that must
  comply with security standards such as NIST, PCI-DSS, or HIPAA, where network monitoring
  and incident detection are critical components.
description: This rule checks that network IDs and IPs are enabled for packet mirroring
  configurations where supported. To verify, access the Google Cloud Console, navigate
  to the Compute Engine section, and review packet mirroring configurations to ensure
  that network IDs and IPs are included. Remediation involves updating the packet
  mirroring settings to include these identifiers, ensuring comprehensive traffic
  analysis and improved incident response capabilities.
