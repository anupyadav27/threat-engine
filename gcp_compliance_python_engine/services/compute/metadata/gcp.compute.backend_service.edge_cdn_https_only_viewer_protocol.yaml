title: Enforce HTTPS for Edge CDN Viewer Protocol on Backend Services
rationale: Enforcing HTTPS for edge CDN viewer protocols minimizes the risk of data
  interception and tampering by ensuring that data in transit is encrypted. This is
  crucial for maintaining user trust and meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS,
  which mandate secure transmission of sensitive information. Failing to enforce HTTPS
  could result in data breaches, legal liabilities, and damage to the organization's
  reputation.
description: This rule checks whether the 'Edge CDN' uses only HTTPS as the viewer
  protocol for backend services. To verify, ensure that the 'protocol' field for the
  backend service is set to 'HTTPS'. To remediate, update the backend service configuration
  to enforce HTTPS by setting the 'protocol' option appropriately. This ensures that
  all data between clients and the CDN is encrypted, protecting against potential
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
