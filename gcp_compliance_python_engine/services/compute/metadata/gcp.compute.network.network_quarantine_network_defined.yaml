title: Define Quarantine Network for Isolating Untrusted Resources
rationale: Defining a quarantine network is crucial to isolate potentially malicious
  or untrusted assets, preventing lateral movement and reducing the risk of data breaches.
  This practice mitigates the impact of compromised resources by containing threats
  and preventing them from affecting other parts of the network. It is an essential
  component for adhering to regulatory frameworks that mandate network segmentation
  and containment strategies.
description: This rule checks if a designated quarantine network is defined and utilized
  within your GCP environment to isolate untrusted or compromised resources. Ensure
  that a virtual network with strict ingress and egress rules is configured to limit
  communication with other network segments. To verify, review your VPC network configurations
  and ensure a network labeled 'quarantine' or equivalent exists, with appropriate
  firewall rules. Remediation involves creating a new VPC network specifically for
  quarantine purposes and configuring firewall rules to restrict traffic.
