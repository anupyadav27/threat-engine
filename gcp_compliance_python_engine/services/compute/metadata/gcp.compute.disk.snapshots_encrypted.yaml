severity: medium
title: Ensure Snapshots Are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting snapshots at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
  unauthorized access and potential breaches. Unencrypted snapshots can be exploited
  if compromised, leading to data leaks and violating compliance with standards like
  PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. Encrypting data at rest mitigates the risk of data exposure
  and enhances data privacy and security posture.
description: This rule checks whether snapshots of Compute Engine disks are encrypted
  using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. Verify that all snapshots
  are encrypted by default by reviewing the encryption settings in the Google Cloud
  Console or using the gcloud command-line tool. To remediate, enable encryption for
  snapshots through the Compute Engine settings, ensuring compliance with encryption
  standards and enhancing data protection.
