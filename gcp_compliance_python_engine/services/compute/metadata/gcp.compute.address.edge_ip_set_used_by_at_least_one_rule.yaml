title: Ensure Edge IP Sets are Actively Used by Firewall Rules
rationale: Unused edge IP sets may indicate misconfiguration or unused resources,
  leading to potential security risks such as unintended exposure of network interfaces
  or inefficient resource utilization. Ensuring that edge IP sets are used by at least
  one firewall rule reduces attack surface and aligns with best practice for resource
  management and security compliance.
description: This rule checks if edge IP sets in Google Cloud Platform's Compute service
  are actively used by at least one firewall rule. Unused IP sets should be reviewed
  and either associated with a relevant firewall rule or decommissioned. This ensures
  that all network configurations are intentional and necessary, reducing risk of
  exposure or unauthorized access. To verify, review the list of edge IP sets and
  corresponding firewall rules in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI, and update configurations
  as needed.
