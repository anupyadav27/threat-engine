title: Configure Secure SSL Ciphers in SSL Policies
rationale: Using insecure SSL ciphers can expose your application to vulnerabilities
  such as man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.
  Organizations must adhere to regulatory standards, like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which
  mandate the use of strong encryption methods to protect sensitive information. Proper
  configuration of SSL policies helps mitigate risks associated with outdated encryption
  protocols.
description: This rule checks if SSL policies in Google Cloud's Compute Engine are
  configured to use secure ciphers only. To verify, ensure that your SSL policies
  exclude weak ciphers such as RC4 or any ciphers using less than 128-bit encryption.
  Remediation involves updating the SSL policy to include only strong ciphers, which
  can be done via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool. This ensures
  compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements.
