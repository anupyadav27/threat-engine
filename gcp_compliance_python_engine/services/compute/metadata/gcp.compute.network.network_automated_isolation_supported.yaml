service: compute
resource: network
requirement: Network Automated Isolation Supported
scope: compute.network.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Network Automated Isolation is Enabled in GCP
rationale: Automated network isolation helps contain security incidents and limits
  unauthorized access. It mitigates risks associated with compromised resources by
  automatically isolating affected networks. This approach reduces the potential impact
  on business operations and supports compliance with security frameworks that require
  incident containment strategies.
description: This rule verifies if automated isolation is supported and enabled within
  Google Cloud's network settings. It checks for configurations like VPC Service Controls
  that facilitate automated isolation of resources based on predefined conditions.
  Ensure you have set up appropriate VPC Service Control boundaries and enabled audit
  logging for network activities to monitor and respond to suspicious behaviors. Remediation
  involves configuring VPC Service Controls and enabling network policies that support
  automated isolation.
