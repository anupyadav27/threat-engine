title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Edge IP Sets
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of edge IP sets reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. It ensures that sensitive network configurations
  are not inadvertently exposed to other accounts, which could be exploited by malicious
  actors to compromise the network. This practice aligns with compliance requirements
  for data protection and access control.
description: This rule checks if edge IP sets are shared across different GCP accounts.
  To verify, review the IAM policies and ensure that edge IP sets are not granted
  access to external accounts. Remediation involves adjusting IAM policies to limit
  access to trusted accounts only. This helps in maintaining network integrity and
  adheres to best practices for least privilege access.
