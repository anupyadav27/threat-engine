title: Ensure Key Pair Age for Compute Instances is Limited
rationale: Limiting the age of key pairs for compute instances is crucial to reduce
  the risk of key compromise. Older keys are more susceptible to being discovered
  and misused by attackers, potentially leading to unauthorized access. Regularly
  rotating key pairs aligns with compliance requirements and mitigates threats such
  as brute force attacks and credential theft.
description: This rule checks that the key pairs used for Google Compute Engine instances
  do not exceed a specified maximum age, typically set to 90 days. To verify, audit
  the SSH key metadata associated with instances and ensure they are rotated within
  the defined period. Remediation involves updating the key pairs by generating new
  keys and replacing the old ones, ensuring minimal disruption and maintaining access
  control integrity.
