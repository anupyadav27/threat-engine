rule_id: gcp.compute.address.network_endpoint_policy_least_privilege
service: compute
resource: address
requirement: Network Endpoint Policy Least Privilege
scope: compute.address.network_security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Network Endpoint Policies
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to network endpoint policies
  minimizes access to only what is necessary, reducing potential attack vectors and
  preventing unauthorized access. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and
  maintaining compliance with standards like NIST and PCI-DSS, which require strict
  access control measures.
description: This rule checks if network endpoint policies associated with compute
  addresses are configured with least privilege in mind. Verify that IAM roles assigned
  to these policies are limited to the minimum permissions necessary. Remediation
  involves auditing the current roles and permissions and adjusting them to ensure
  they only allow essential actions, thus minimizing potential security risks.
