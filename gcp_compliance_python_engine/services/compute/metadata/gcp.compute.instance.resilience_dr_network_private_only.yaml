title: Ensure Compute Instances Use Private Networks for DR Resilience
rationale: Limiting compute instance network interfaces to private networks enhances
  security by reducing exposure to external threats, thereby supporting business continuity
  through resilient disaster recovery (DR) strategies. This practice mitigates risks
  such as data breaches and unauthorized access, and aligns with compliance requirements
  that mandate controlled and limited network access.
description: This rule checks that all Google Cloud Compute instances configured for
  disaster recovery (DR) are connected only to private networks. Instances should
  not have public IP addresses to avoid exposure to the internet. To verify, inspect
  the network interfaces of your instances to confirm they are attached only to private
  subnets. Remediation involves configuring instances without public IPs and ensuring
  they are associated with VPC networks configured for private connectivity.
