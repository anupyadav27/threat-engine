title: Ensure Compute Instances Have Distributions Logging Enabled
rationale: Enabling distributions logging for compute instances is crucial for monitoring
  and analyzing the distribution of network traffic and resource usage, which helps
  in identifying potential security threats and performance bottlenecks. It also supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring that all access and activity
  logs are captured and reviewed, reducing the risk of undetected breaches.
description: This rule checks whether distribution logging is enabled for all compute
  instances, which requires configuring the appropriate logging settings in the GCP
  Console or using gcloud commands. To enable this, navigate to the 'Logging' section
  under the instance's settings and ensure that logging is activated. This setup allows
  for comprehensive visibility into the instance's operations and network traffic,
  facilitating timely threat detection and incident response.
