title: Ensure Compute Instances Use Private Networks for Resilience
rationale: Restricting compute instances to private networks reduces exposure to potential
  external threats and minimizes attack surfaces. This isolation is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data and maintaining service availability, particularly for systems handling
  critical workloads or sensitive information. Compliance with regulatory standards
  often mandates network segmentation to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule verifies that all Google Compute Engine instances are configured
  to operate solely on private networks. Instances should not have external IP addresses,
  ensuring they are not accessible from the internet directly. To remediate, review
  your instances' network interface settings and ensure they are aligned with private
  network configurations. Utilize VPC firewall rules to further control instance access
  and maintain strong network segmentation.
