title: Enable Logging for Backend Service Access to GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling server access logging for backend services that interact with
  GCP Storage Buckets is crucial for monitoring and auditing access patterns. This
  logging provides visibility into access operations, aiding in the detection of unauthorized
  access or anomalies. It supports compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and
  HIPAA, which require detailed access logs for sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for backend services that access
  GCP Storage Buckets. To verify, ensure that the 'logConfig' field is configured
  in the backend service with 'enable' set to true. Remediation involves updating
  the backend service configuration to include 'logConfig', thereby enabling logging.
  This ensures audit trails are maintained for all access requests, supporting both
  security and compliance efforts.
