title: Ensure Network Logging is Enabled for Firewall Rules
rationale: Enabling network logging on firewall rules is critical for monitoring and
  auditing network traffic, helping to identify unauthorized access attempts or breaches.
  This enhances visibility into network operations, supports incident response efforts,
  and aids in meeting various compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and SOC2 by
  providing detailed records of data flow across network boundaries.
description: This rule checks if network logging is enabled for all firewall rules
  within your GCP project. Network logging should be enabled to capture logs of connections
  passing through your firewall, providing crucial data for security analysis and
  incident response. To remediate, ensure that logging is turned on for each firewall
  rule by setting the 'enableLogging' field to true. Verification can be performed
  by reviewing the firewall rule settings in the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud
  CLI.
