title: Restrict Firewall Rules to Avoid Open Access
rationale: Allowing open access through firewall rules can expose your network to
  unauthorized access and potential cyber threats, increasing the risk of data breaches
  and compromising sensitive information. Adhering to the principle of least privilege
  and preventing 'allow all' rules is crucial for maintaining security posture and
  ensuring compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules in GCP that permit open access to
  all IP addresses. It ensures that no firewall rule is overly permissive by allowing
  traffic from any IP, which can be verified by reviewing the 'sourceRanges' field
  in firewall configurations. To remediate, replace overly broad source ranges with
  specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks that correspond to trusted sources, reducing
  the attack surface.
