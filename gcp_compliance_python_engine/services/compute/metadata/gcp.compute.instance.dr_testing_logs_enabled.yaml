title: Enable DR Testing Logs for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling disaster recovery (DR) testing logs for compute instances is crucial
  for ensuring that all DR test activities are recorded and auditable. This helps
  organizations identify potential issues in their DR plans, improve system resilience,
  and meet compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate logging
  and monitoring of DR activities.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for disaster recovery testing
  activities on GCP Compute Engine instances. To verify, ensure that Stackdriver Logging
  is configured to capture DR test logs by setting up a log sink for relevant projects.
  Remediation involves creating a log sink in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI that
  targets DR testing activities, ensuring that all DR tests are logged and stored
  for future analysis.
