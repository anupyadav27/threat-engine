service: compute
resource: instance
requirement: DR Testing Results Storage Encrypted And Private
scope: compute.instance.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DR Test Results Are Encrypted and Access is Restricted
rationale: Encrypting and restricting access to DR testing results protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality, especially as these results may contain sensitive
  information critical for business continuity plans. Non-compliance with encryption
  standards can lead to significant financial penalties and damage to reputation.
description: This rule checks that storage solutions used for Disaster Recovery (DR)
  testing results within Compute Engine instances are encrypted and have access controls
  in place. Verify that disks are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
  (CMEK) and that IAM policies restrict access to authorized personnel only. Remediation
  involves enabling encryption on all relevant storage resources and reviewing IAM
  policies to ensure least privilege access.
