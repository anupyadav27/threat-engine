title: Enable Encryption at Rest for GCP Compute Disks
rationale: Ensuring data stored on Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine disks is encrypted
  at rest protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  This is critical for maintaining customer trust, meeting regulatory requirements
  like GDPR and HIPAA, and mitigating the risk of data exposure in case of hardware
  theft or unauthorized administrative access.
description: This rule checks whether encryption at rest is enabled for Google Cloud
  Platform Compute Engine disks. By default, GCP encrypts all data at rest; however,
  users can apply their own encryption keys for added security. To verify this, ensure
  that the Compute Engine disks have the 'encryptionKey' property configured. Remediation
  involves setting up Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) through Google Cloud
  Key Management Service (KMS) and updating disk configurations to use these keys.
