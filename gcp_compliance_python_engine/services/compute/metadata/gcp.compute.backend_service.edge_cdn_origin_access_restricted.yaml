title: Restrict Edge CDN Origin Access for Backend Services
rationale: Restricting access to the origins of Edge CDN prevents unauthorized entities
  from bypassing caching layers to access backend services directly. This reduces
  the risk of data breaches, service disruptions, and unnecessary load on backend
  systems, aligning with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if the backend services in GCP Compute are configured
  to restrict origin access when using Edge CDN. Ensure that origin access is limited
  to trusted sources by configuring appropriate identity and access management (IAM)
  policies. Verify that backend services have settings that enforce origin access
  restrictions and update IAM roles and policies to limit permissions to necessary
  entities only.
