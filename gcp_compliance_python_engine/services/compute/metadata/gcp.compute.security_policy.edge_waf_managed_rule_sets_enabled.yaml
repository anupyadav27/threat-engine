title: Enable Edge WAF Managed Rule Sets on Security Policies
rationale: Enabling Edge WAF Managed Rule Sets mitigates security risks by providing
  automatic protection against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting (XSS). This enhances the security posture of applications by
  reducing the risk of data breaches and downtime caused by malicious attacks. It
  also aids in meeting compliance requirements like PCI-DSS by ensuring that web applications
  are protected against known threats.
description: This rule checks if Edge WAF Managed Rule Sets are enabled on Google
  Cloud Platform security policies. Managed rule sets provide predefined rules that
  detect and block malicious web traffic, which can be crucial for safeguarding applications
  from a wide range of attacks. To verify, inspect the security policies in the GCP
  console under 'Network Security' and ensure that managed rule sets are applied.
  If not enabled, configure the security policy to include Edge WAF Managed Rule Sets
  to enhance protection.
