title: Ensure TLS 1.2+ for Edge CDN in Backend Services
rationale: Enforcing a minimum of TLS 1.2 for Edge CDN connections in backend services
  protects data in transit from interception and tampering by ensuring strong encryption
  protocols. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially
  in compliance-driven industries such as finance and healthcare, where robust encryption
  standards are mandated by regulations like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether backend services in Google Cloud's Compute Engine
  enforce a minimum of TLS 1.2 for connections through the Edge CDN. To verify compliance,
  ensure that the 'minTlsVersion' attribute in the backend service configuration is
  set to 'TLS_1_2' or higher in the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud command-line
  tool. Remediate non-compliance by updating the backend service settings to enforce
  TLS 1.2 or higher, thereby enhancing data in transit protection.
