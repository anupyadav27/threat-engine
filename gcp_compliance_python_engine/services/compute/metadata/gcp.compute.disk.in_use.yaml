title: Ensure GCP Compute Disks Are Attached to Active Instances
rationale: Unused disks in GCP incur costs and can lead to potential security risks
  such as unauthorized access or data leaks. Ensuring disks are in use helps optimize
  resource allocation and reduces the attack surface by limiting exposure of data
  stored on unassociated disks. It also aids in maintaining compliance with data protection
  standards by ensuring data is not inadvertently exposed.
description: This rule checks that all Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine disks
  are attached to active instances. Disks that are not in use should be evaluated
  and either attached to an instance or deleted if no longer needed. This helps in
  managing costs effectively and reducing security risks. To remediate, attach unattached
  disks to appropriate instances or delete them if they are redundant.
