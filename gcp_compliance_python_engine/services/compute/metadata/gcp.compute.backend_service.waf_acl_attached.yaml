title: Ensure WAF ACL is Attached to Backend Services
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) to
  backend services helps protect against common web exploits that could compromise
  data integrity and availability. Without this protection, an application is more
  vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), which
  can lead to data breaches and service disruptions. Compliance with security standards
  like PCI-DSS and NIST requires robust application layer protections, which WAFs
  provide.
description: This check verifies that a WAF ACL is attached to Google Cloud Platform's
  backend services. A WAF ACL helps filter and monitor HTTP requests, providing an
  additional layer of security by allowing or blocking requests based on predefined
  rules. To verify, access the GCP Console, navigate to the Compute Engine section,
  and ensure each backend service has an associated WAF ACL. Remediation involves
  creating or associating a WAF ACL with the backend service if it is not already
  attached.
