title: Enable Network Load Balancer Access Logs
rationale: Enabling access logs for Network Load Balancers provides critical visibility
  into traffic patterns and potential security threats, allowing for timely detection
  and response to unauthorized access attempts or anomalies. This is essential for
  compliance with auditing requirements and helps in forensic investigations and operational
  oversight.
description: This rule checks whether access logging is enabled for Network Load Balancers
  using URL maps in Google Cloud Platform. Logs capture important details about incoming
  requests, which can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting. To enable logging,
  ensure that the 'logConfig' field is set within the URL map's configuration in the
  Google Cloud Console or via gcloud CLI. Regularly review logs to identify any suspicious
  activity and maintain a secure environment.
