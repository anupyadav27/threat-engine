severity: medium
title: Ensure Edge WAF IP Rate Limit Rules Configured
rationale: Configuring IP rate limit rules on Edge WAF helps mitigate denial-of-service
  attacks and limits the potential for abuse from malicious actors. This is crucial
  for maintaining availability and ensuring that legitimate traffic is not disrupted,
  thereby supporting business continuity and compliance with security standards that
  require protection against such threats.
description: This rule checks whether IP rate limit rules are configured on GCP Edge
  WAF within security policies where supported. To verify, inspect your security policy
  settings in the GCP Console or via gcloud commands to ensure rate limiting is enabled.
  If not configured, establish rate limits based on expected traffic patterns to prevent
  abuse. Remediation involves modifying security policies to include rate limiting
  rules, which can be done through the GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool.
