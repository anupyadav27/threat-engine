title: Ensure Inventory API is Enabled on Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling the Inventory API on compute instances allows for better asset
  management and monitoring, helping to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This
  is crucial for maintaining compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001 and
  ensuring that only approved software is installed, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  or outdated configurations.
description: This rule checks if the Inventory API is enabled on Google Compute Engine
  instances, which is essential for collecting data about installed packages and OS
  configurations. To verify this setting, access the Compute Engine API in the GCP
  Console and ensure the Inventory API is activated. If it is not enabled, navigate
  to the API & Services section, find the Inventory API, and activate it to ensure
  comprehensive instance monitoring and compliance with security policies.
