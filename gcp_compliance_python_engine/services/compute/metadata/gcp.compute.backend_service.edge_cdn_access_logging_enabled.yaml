title: Enable Edge CDN Access Logging for Backend Services
rationale: Enabling Edge CDN access logging enhances visibility into request patterns
  and access behaviors, helping to identify potential security threats and performance
  issues. It also supports compliance with regulations that require logging of access
  to critical resources, thereby reducing the risk of undetected malicious activity
  and providing a clear audit trail for forensic investigations.
description: This rule checks if Edge CDN access logging is enabled for Google Cloud
  backend services. To verify, ensure that the 'logging' configuration of each backend
  service includes the 'logConfig' field with 'enable' set to true. Remediation involves
  updating the backend service configuration to enable logging, which can be done
  via the GCP Console or command-line interface by setting the appropriate logging
  parameters.
