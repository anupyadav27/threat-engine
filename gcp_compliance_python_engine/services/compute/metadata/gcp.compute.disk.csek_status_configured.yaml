title: Ensure CMEK is Configured for Compute Disks
rationale: Configuring Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) for disks helps secure
  data at rest by allowing organizations to manage and control encryption keys. This
  mitigates risks associated with unauthorized data access and is essential for meeting
  compliance requirements like GDPR and HIPAA, where data protection is crucial.
description: This rule checks if Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) are configured
  for Google Cloud Compute Engine disks. To verify, inspect the disk configuration
  for 'diskEncryptionKey' settings that specify a CSEK. Remediation involves updating
  disk settings to include a CSEK, ensuring the encryption keys used align with organizational
  security policies. This enhances data security by ensuring encryption keys are managed
  by the organization.
