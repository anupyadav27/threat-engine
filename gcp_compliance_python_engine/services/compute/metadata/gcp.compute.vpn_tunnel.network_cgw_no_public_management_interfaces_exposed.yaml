title: Prevent Public Exposure of VPN Tunnel Management Interfaces
rationale: Exposing VPN tunnel management interfaces to the public internet increases
  the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential service disruptions.
  Such exposure can lead to compliance violations with frameworks like NIST and PCI-DSS,
  which require secure data transmission channels. Ensuring that management interfaces
  are only accessible from trusted networks mitigates these risks and protects sensitive
  data in transit.
description: This rule checks that VPN tunnel management interfaces are not publicly
  accessible on Google Cloud Platform. It ensures that these interfaces are restricted
  to known and trusted networks by configuring appropriate firewall rules. Verification
  involves checking the inbound rules for the relevant VPN tunnel and confirming that
  no public IP addresses are allowed. Remediation includes updating firewall configurations
  to restrict access to internal or specific external IP ranges only.
