resource: network
requirement: Check Default Absence

domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Ensure Default Network Is Not Present in GCP Projects
rationale: The default network in GCP is automatically created with permissive firewall
  rules and is not tailored to specific security needs, posing a potential security
  risk. Organizations may inadvertently use it, leading to exposure to unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Removing it helps align with security best practices and
  compliance requirements, reducing the attack surface.
description: This rule checks for the presence of the default network in your GCP
  projects. By default, GCP creates a network with open firewall rules that may not
  adhere to your organization's security policies. To enhance security, delete the
  default network if it exists and create custom networks with specific firewall rules
  that align with your security posture. Verify by using the GCP Console or gcloud
  CLI to list available networks and ensure the default is absent. Remediate by deleting
  the default network via the console or `gcloud compute networks delete default`
  command.
