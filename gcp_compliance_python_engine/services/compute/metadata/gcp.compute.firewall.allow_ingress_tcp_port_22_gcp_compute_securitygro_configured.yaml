subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Restrict Ingress TCP Port 22 to Specific IPs in GCP Firewall
rationale: Allowing unrestricted access to TCP port 22 (SSH) can expose virtual machines
  to unauthorized access attempts and brute-force attacks, compromising sensitive
  data. Implementing strict access controls aligns with regulatory requirements such
  as PCI-DSS and helps mitigate potential security breaches.
description: This rule checks for GCP firewall configurations that permit ingress
  traffic on TCP port 22 from any source IP. It is crucial to limit access to known
  IP addresses to reduce the attack surface. Verify firewall rules and update them
  to allow SSH access only from trusted IP addresses or ranges. Remediation involves
  modifying the firewall rule to specify allowed source IPs, ensuring enhanced security
  while maintaining necessary access.
