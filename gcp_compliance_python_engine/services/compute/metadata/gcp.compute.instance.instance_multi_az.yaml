title: Ensure Compute Instances are Configured for Multi-Region Availability
rationale: Deploying compute instances across multiple zones enhances fault tolerance
  and business continuity by mitigating the risk of a single-zone failure. This configuration
  is crucial for maintaining service availability and meeting compliance with standards
  that require high availability and disaster recovery solutions.
description: This rule checks if compute instances are configured to run in multiple
  zones within a region, ensuring redundancy and reliability. Instances should be
  part of managed instance groups with multi-zonal configurations. Verify this by
  reviewing instance group settings in the GCP Console or via CLI, ensuring that the
  'distributionPolicy.zones' setting includes multiple zones. Remediation involves
  updating instance groups to include multiple zones or creating new multi-zonal configurations.
