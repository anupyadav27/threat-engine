title: Restrict Egress Traffic for Data Warehouse Firewall
rationale: Unrestricted egress traffic from data warehouse resources can expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized networks, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Restricting egress traffic minimizes
  the attack surface and ensures that only legitimate communication channels are used,
  reducing the risk of data exfiltration.
description: This rule checks if egress traffic from the data warehouse firewall is
  restricted to necessary IP ranges and ports. To verify, ensure that egress rules
  specify allowed destination IPs and protocols, and block all others by default.
  Remediation involves updating firewall rules to only allow traffic to known, trusted
  destinations necessary for business operations, and logging all egress activities
  for audit purposes.
