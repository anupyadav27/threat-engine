title: Ensure Load Balancer Health Check is Configured for Instances
rationale: Configuring a health check for instances behind a load balancer ensures
  that traffic is only routed to healthy instances, improving the availability and
  reliability of applications. Without proper health checks, there is a risk of sending
  traffic to unresponsive or malfunctioning instances, leading to application downtime
  and potential business disruptions. This is crucial for maintaining service level
  agreements and meeting compliance standards regarding uptime and reliability.
description: This rule checks whether health checks are configured for instances behind
  Google Cloud Load Balancers. Health checks monitor the status of instances, ensuring
  that only healthy instances receive traffic. To verify, inspect the load balancer's
  configuration in the Google Cloud Console or use the gcloud CLI to confirm health
  checks are set. Remediation involves navigating to the Load Balancer settings and
  ensuring health checks are properly defined for each instance group attached to
  the load balancer.
