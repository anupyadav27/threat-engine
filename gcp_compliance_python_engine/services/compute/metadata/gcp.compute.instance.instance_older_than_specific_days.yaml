subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: low
title: Identify and Manage Aging Compute Instances
rationale: Compute instances that have been running longer than necessary may be using
  outdated software, posing security risks due to unpatched vulnerabilities. This
  can lead to increased exposure to exploitation and non-compliance with security
  policies that mandate regular instance updates. Regularly reviewing and updating
  such instances ensures alignment with security best practices and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks for Google Cloud Compute instances that have been operational
  beyond a specified number of days. Instances that exceed this threshold should be
  reviewed for software updates, configuration changes, or decommissioning if no longer
  needed. Administrators can use the Google Cloud Console or CLI to list instances,
  assess their creation dates, and take appropriate remediation steps such as updating
  the instance or replacing it with a newer, patched version.
