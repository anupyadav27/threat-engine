title: Restrict Default Firewall Rules in GCP Compute
rationale: Default firewall rules in GCP can expose your network to unauthorized access,
  potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions. By restricting these
  rules, organizations can minimize attack surfaces, comply with best practices, and
  adhere to regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for the existence and configuration of default firewall
  rules in GCP Compute that allow unrestricted traffic. It ensures these rules are
  modified to restrict access only to necessary services and IP ranges. To verify,
  review the 'default-allow' rules in your GCP Firewall settings and update them to
  use restrictive source ranges and protocols. Remediation involves adjusting the
  'default' network's firewall settings to limit exposure.
