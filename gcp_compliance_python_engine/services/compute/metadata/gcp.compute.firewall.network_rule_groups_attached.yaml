severity: medium
title: Ensure Network Rule Groups Are Attached to Firewalls
rationale: Attaching network rule groups to firewalls ensures that traffic is managed
  and monitored according to defined security policies. This reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements by controlling
  ingress and egress traffic effectively.
description: This rule checks whether network rule groups are attached to GCP Compute
  Firewall resources, which are essential for applying consistent and comprehensive
  access control policies. Network rule groups allow for scalable management of firewall
  rules, enabling centralized updates and enforcement. To verify, ensure that all
  firewalls have associated rule groups via the GCP Console or CLI. Remediation involves
  creating or updating firewall rules to include network rule groups as applicable.
