title: Restrict Unrestricted Ingress in Firewall Rules
rationale: Allowing unrestricted ingress to your GCP network can expose critical resources
  to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches, service disruptions,
  and compliance violations. Attackers can exploit open ports to launch attacks or
  gain unauthorized access, impacting operational integrity and regulatory compliance
  with frameworks like PCI-DSS and NIST.
description: This check ensures that GCP firewall rules are not configured with wide-open
  ingress settings. It assesses firewall rules for overly permissive source IP ranges
  (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) that may expose services to the internet without proper access
  controls. To remediate, review and update these rules to specify more restrictive
  IP ranges or use identity-aware proxy configurations to limit access to trusted
  sources.
