title: Ensure TLS 1.2+ for Network Listener on Forwarding Rules
rationale: Utilizing TLS version 1.2 or higher for network listeners on forwarding
  rules is critical to safeguard data in transit against interception and tampering.
  Older TLS versions are vulnerable to several known exploits that could compromise
  data integrity and confidentiality. This configuration aids in meeting compliance
  obligations under standards like PCI-DSS, which require strong encryption protocols.
description: This check ensures that all forwarding rules in Google Cloud Compute
  Engine enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for network listeners. Verify this by
  inspecting the 'minTlsVersion' attribute of each forwarding rule's associated HTTPS
  or SSL proxy. If the version is below 1.2, update the configuration via the Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to enforce TLS 1.2 or higher. This helps prevent downgrade
  attacks and ensures secure data transmission.
