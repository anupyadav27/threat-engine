title: Disable SSH Password Authentication on Compute Instances
rationale: Disabling SSH password authentication reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access by preventing brute force attacks that exploit weak passwords. This practice
  enhances security by enforcing key-based authentication, which is significantly
  more secure and aligns with compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001,
  protecting sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether SSH password authentication is disabled on Google
  Compute Engine instances. To verify, examine the SSH configuration file to ensure
  'PasswordAuthentication no' is set. Remediation involves updating the SSH configuration
  and restarting the SSH service to apply changes, thereby enforcing the use of SSH
  keys for authentication. This step is crucial for minimizing attack vectors on cloud
  resources.
