title: Ensure DR Change Audit Logging is Enabled for Instance Templates
rationale: Enabling audit logging for disaster recovery (DR) changes in instance templates
  is crucial to track any unauthorized or inappropriate modifications. This helps
  in maintaining the integrity of DR plans, preventing data loss, and ensuring business
  continuity. It also aids in meeting compliance requirements by providing a verifiable
  trail of changes.
description: This rule checks if audit logging is enabled for changes made to instance
  templates, specifically those related to disaster recovery configurations. To verify,
  ensure that the 'enableLogging' attribute is set to true in the instance template's
  configuration. If logging is not enabled, update the instance template settings
  to include logging for all change activities. This helps in auditing access and
  modifications to DR settings.
