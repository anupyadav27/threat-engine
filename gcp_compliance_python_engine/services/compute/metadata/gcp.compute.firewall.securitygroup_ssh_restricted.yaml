title: Restrict SSH Access in GCP Firewall Rules
rationale: Unrestricted SSH access can expose your infrastructure to unauthorized
  access and potential attacks, leading to data breaches and service disruptions.
  By limiting SSH access to specific IP ranges or using identity-aware proxy, you
  reduce attack vectors and comply with best practices such as the CIS GCP Benchmark,
  NIST, and PCI-DSS requirements.
description: This check ensures that SSH access (port 22) is restricted in GCP firewall
  rules to only allow trusted IP addresses or ranges. Verify that firewall rules do
  not permit 0.0.0.0/0 for SSH and implement identity-aware proxy where possible.
  Remediation involves updating firewall rules to specify trusted IP addresses and
  auditing rules regularly to ensure compliance.
