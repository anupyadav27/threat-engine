title: Ensure Network Alert Destinations for Packet Mirroring are Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of network alert destinations for packet mirroring
  is essential to ensure that traffic anomalies and potential security threats are
  detected and addressed promptly. Without configured alert destinations, critical
  security events may go unnoticed, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
  Compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and NIST requires proper monitoring and
  alerting mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information.
description: This rule checks if network alert destinations are configured for Packet
  Mirroring in GCP Compute. It ensures that mirrored traffic is monitored and that
  alerts are sent to designated destinations, such as Security Operations Centers
  (SOCs), for analysis. To verify, ensure alert destinations are set in the Packet
  Mirroring configuration under the 'MirrorConfig' settings. Remediation involves
  specifying valid alert destinations in the Packet Mirroring policy to ensure all
  mirrored traffic is properly monitored.
