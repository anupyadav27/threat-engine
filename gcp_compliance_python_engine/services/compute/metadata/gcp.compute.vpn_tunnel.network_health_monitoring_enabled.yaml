title: Enable Network Health Monitoring for VPN Tunnels
rationale: Enabling network health monitoring for VPN tunnels is crucial for ensuring
  the reliability and performance of your network connections. Without it, potential
  issues such as packet loss or latency might go unnoticed, leading to disrupted services
  and potential downtime. This monitoring is also important for meeting compliance
  requirements that mandate continuous network oversight to ensure data integrity
  and availability.
description: This rule checks whether network health monitoring is enabled for Google
  Cloud VPN tunnels. To verify, ensure that the VPN tunnel configuration includes
  health check settings that actively monitor tunnel status and performance metrics.
  Remediation involves configuring VPN tunnels with appropriate health check parameters
  via the GCP Console or using the gcloud command-line tool. This proactive approach
  helps in maintaining optimal performance and quickly identifying any issues that
  may arise.
