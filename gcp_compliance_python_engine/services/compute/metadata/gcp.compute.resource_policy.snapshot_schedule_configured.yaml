title: Ensure Snapshot Schedule is Configured for Compute Resource Policies
rationale: Configuring snapshot schedules for resource policies is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and availability in GCP environments. It helps mitigate risks associated
  with data loss due to accidental deletion or system failures, ensuring business
  continuity and compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks whether a snapshot schedule is configured for each resource
  policy in Google Cloud's Compute service. Without a snapshot schedule, data may
  not be regularly backed up, leading to potential data loss. To verify, review the
  resource policy settings in the GCP Console or via the gcloud command-line tool.
  Remediation involves creating or updating resource policies to include regular snapshot
  schedules, ensuring backups are taken at appropriate intervals.
