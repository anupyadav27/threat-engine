title: Ensure OS Login is Enabled for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling OS Login enhances security by centralizing identity management
  and providing consistent access controls across instances. This reduces the risk
  of unauthorized access and simplifies compliance with regulatory frameworks such
  as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require robust identity and access management practices.
  It also mitigates the threat of compromised SSH keys by eliminating the need for
  local key management.
description: 'This rule checks whether OS Login is enabled at the project level for
  Google Compute Engine instances. OS Login uses IAM roles to manage SSH access, replacing
  traditional SSH keys with Google-managed keys, thereby improving security and auditability.
  To verify, check if the metadata ''enable-oslogin'' is set to ''TRUE'' at the project
  level. Remediation involves enabling OS Login via the Google Cloud Console or using
  the gcloud command-line tool: `gcloud compute project-info add-metadata --metadata
  enable-oslogin=TRUE`.'
