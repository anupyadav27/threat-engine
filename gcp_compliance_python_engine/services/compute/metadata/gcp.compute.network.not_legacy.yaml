title: Avoid Use of Legacy Networks in GCP
rationale: Legacy networks in GCP lack the advanced features and controls of VPC networks,
  potentially exposing systems to security risks such as unauthorized access and limited
  traffic management capabilities. Using non-legacy networks supports business continuity
  by providing enhanced scalability, better integration with modern services, and
  compliance with industry standards, reducing the risk of non-compliance with regulations
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This check verifies that no legacy networks are in use within GCP projects.
  Legacy networks are identified by their flat global IP address space, which lacks
  the segmentation capabilities of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks. To ensure
  compliance, administrators should migrate any legacy networks to VPC networks, which
  offer subnet-level segmentation, custom routes, and firewall rules. Verification
  can be done through the GCP Console or CLI by listing all networks and ensuring
  'VPC' is used. Remediation involves creating VPC networks and migrating resources
  from legacy networks.
