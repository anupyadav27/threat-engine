rule_id: gcp.compute.instance.paas_no_public_ip_unless_required
service: compute
resource: instance
requirement: Paas No Public Ip Unless Required
scope: compute.instance.public_access
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
severity: critical
title: Prevent Unnecessary Public IPs on PaaS Compute Instances
rationale: Public IPs on PaaS compute instances increase the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, exposing critical workloads to the internet.
  This can lead to compliance violations with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA,
  and increase the attack surface for cyber threats. Ensuring instances do not have
  public IPs unless necessary mitigates these risks and supports secure architecture
  practices.
description: This rule checks for PaaS compute instances assigned with public IP addresses
  without explicit justification. Instances should be configured to use internal IPs
  unless access from the internet is essential and properly secured. To remediate,
  review network settings in the Google Cloud Console or via the CLI, removing public
  IPs where not needed, and consider using Cloud NAT for outbound internet access
  without exposing instances directly.
