title: Disallow Wide Open Ingress to Data Warehouse Firewalls
rationale: Allowing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to data warehouse systems can expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches. This is particularly
  critical for organizations handling regulated data, where compliance with standards
  like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR is necessary to avoid fines and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules that permit ingress traffic from
  any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) to data warehouse resources. Such configurations should
  be restricted to mitigate unauthorized access risks. To remediate, modify the firewall
  rule to limit ingress to trusted IP ranges or utilize identity-aware proxies. Verification
  can be done via the Google Cloud Console by reviewing firewall rules under the Compute
  Engine section.
