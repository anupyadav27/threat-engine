title: Ensure Least Privilege for DR Testing Execution on Compute Instances
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege for disaster recovery (DR) testing
  roles minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, reducing potential data breaches
  and disruptions. This is crucial for maintaining business continuity and protecting
  sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulations such as NIST and PCI-DSS, which
  mandate controlled access to critical infrastructure.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned for DR testing on Compute instances
  are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their specific tasks, avoiding
  excessive privileges. Verify that IAM roles do not include permissions beyond what
  is strictly required for DR testing. To remediate, audit existing roles and adjust
  permissions to align with the principle of least privilege, using predefined roles
  or custom roles tailored to specific DR tasks.
