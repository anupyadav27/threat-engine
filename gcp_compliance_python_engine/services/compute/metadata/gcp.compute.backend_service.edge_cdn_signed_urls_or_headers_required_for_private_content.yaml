title: Require Signed URLs/Headers for Private CDN Content
rationale: Ensuring that edge CDN traffic is verified using signed URLs or headers
  helps protect private content from unauthorized access and reduces the risk of data
  breaches. This control is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity,
  especially for businesses subject to compliance requirements like PCI-DSS or HIPAA,
  where unauthorized data exposure can lead to significant financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud's Backend Services within the private
  networking scope require signed URLs or headers for edge CDN access to private content.
  To verify, ensure that the 'signedUrlKeyNames' or 'signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec' fields
  are set when configuring backend services. Remediation involves updating the backend
  service configuration to enforce signed URL or header requirements, thereby ensuring
  that only authenticated requests can access sensitive content.
