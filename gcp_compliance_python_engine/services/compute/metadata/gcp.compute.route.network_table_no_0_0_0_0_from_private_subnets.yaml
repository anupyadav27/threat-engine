title: Prevent 0.0.0.0/0 Routes from Private Subnets
rationale: Allowing routes to 0.0.0.0/0 from private subnets can expose sensitive
  data and resources to the entire internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access
  and data breaches. This configuration could lead to non-compliance with standards
  like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which require stringent access controls for sensitive data.
description: This rule checks for routes in Google Cloud Platform that allow traffic
  from private subnets to be directed to 0.0.0.0/0, which represents the entire internet.
  Ensure that your routes are configured to restrict such access unless explicitly
  required and securely managed. To remediate, audit your routing tables to ensure
  that no route from a private subnet is set to 0.0.0.0/0, and adjust the routes to
  ensure they target only necessary and secure destinations.
