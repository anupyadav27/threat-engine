title: Prevent Open Access in Edge Rule Groups for URL Maps
rationale: Allowing unrestricted access in edge rule groups can expose critical application
  endpoints to potential attacks such as DDoS and unauthorized data access. Controlling
  access ensures that only legitimate traffic reaches your applications, thereby mitigating
  security risks and helping comply with industry standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for 'permit all' configurations in edge rule groups
  of URL maps within your Google Cloud Platform environment. A 'permit all' rule can
  lead to exposing your application to the internet without restrictions, leading
  to security vulnerabilities. To remediate, configure specific allow or deny rules
  based on IP ranges, headers, or other attributes to limit access. Verification can
  be done by reviewing the URL map edge rule groups in the GCP Console or using gcloud
  commands to ensure no overly permissive rules exist.
