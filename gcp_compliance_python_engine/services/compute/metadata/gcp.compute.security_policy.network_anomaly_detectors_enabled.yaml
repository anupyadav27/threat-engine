title: Enable Network Anomaly Detectors in Security Policies
rationale: Network anomaly detectors are essential for identifying unusual patterns
  that could indicate potential security threats such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized
  access attempts. Enabling these detectors helps organizations to proactively mitigate
  risks, comply with regulatory standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, and protect
  sensitive data from breaches.
description: This rule checks whether network anomaly detectors are enabled in GCP
  security policies for Compute Engine. To verify, access the Google Cloud Console,
  navigate to 'Security Policies' under the 'Compute Engine' service, and ensure that
  anomaly detection is activated. Remediation involves enabling this feature in the
  security policy settings to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.
