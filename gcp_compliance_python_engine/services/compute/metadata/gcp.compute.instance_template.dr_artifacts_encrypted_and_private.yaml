resource: instance_template
requirement: DR Artifacts Encrypted And Private
scope: compute.instance_template.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DR Artifacts in Instance Templates Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting disaster recovery (DR) artifacts in instance templates protects
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and exposure. Without encryption and privacy
  controls, there is a heightened risk of data breaches, which can lead to financial
  loss and damage to reputation. Additionally, compliance with regulations like GDPR
  and CCPA requires robust data protection measures, including encryption at rest.
description: This rule checks that all DR artifacts associated with GCP Compute Engine
  instance templates are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) and
  are not publicly accessible. Verify that the instance templates specify CMEK for
  disk encryption. Remediation involves updating the instance template to include
  CMEK and ensuring appropriate IAM roles are applied to restrict access. This helps
  maintain data confidentiality and integrity.
