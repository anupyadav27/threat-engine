title: Enable Network Change Audit Logging for Instance Templates
rationale: Enabling network change audit logging for instance templates is crucial
  for maintaining visibility over modifications that could impact your cloud infrastructure.
  Without these logs, unauthorized or erroneous changes could go undetected, leading
  to potential exposure of resources, disruptions in service, and non-compliance with
  regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and SOC 2. Monitoring network changes helps
  in quickly identifying and responding to suspicious activities, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring operational integrity.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging for network changes is enabled
  on Google Cloud instance templates. Specifically, it verifies that audit logs are
  configured to capture events related to network alterations such as updates to firewall
  rules or changes to network configurations. To ensure compliance, navigate to the
  'Audit Logs' section in the Google Cloud Console, select the appropriate service
  and resource, and enable logging for 'Admin Read' and 'Admin Write' activities.
  This can be automated using Terraform or gcloud CLI commands. Regularly review these
  logs for unauthorized access or anomalies.
