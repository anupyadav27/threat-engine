title: Enforce Default Deny Policy Between Network Tiers
rationale: Implementing a default deny policy between network tiers minimizes the
  risk of lateral movement by attackers and helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources. This is critical for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality,
  as it ensures that only explicitly permitted communication is allowed, aligning
  with regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that firewall rules enforce a default deny policy between
  different network tiers within GCP. By default, all inbound and outbound traffic
  between tiers should be denied, and only specific, necessary communications should
  be allowed. To verify compliance, review firewall rule settings in the GCP Console
  or using the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves configuring firewall
  rules to explicitly allow only required traffic while denying all other traffic
  by default.
