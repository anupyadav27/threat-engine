title: Ensure DNS Alerts Configured for Compute Health Checks
rationale: Configuring DNS alerts for health checks is crucial for timely detection
  and response to potential disruptions in service availability. Without these alerts,
  businesses risk prolonged downtime, impacting customer satisfaction and potentially
  leading to financial losses. Additionally, this practice supports compliance with
  industry standards that mandate monitoring and alerting for critical infrastructure.
description: This rule checks if DNS-based alerts are configured for Compute Engine
  health checks. Properly configured alerts ensure that any issues with DNS resolution
  impacting health checks are promptly notified to the relevant teams. To verify,
  ensure that alert policies are configured in Cloud Monitoring with conditions based
  on DNS health check metrics. Remediation involves setting up alert policies that
  trigger notifications when DNS resolution issues are detected for health checks.
