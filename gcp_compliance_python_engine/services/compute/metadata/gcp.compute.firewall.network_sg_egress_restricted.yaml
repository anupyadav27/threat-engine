title: Restrict Egress Traffic in GCP Firewall Rules
rationale: Unrestricted egress traffic from GCP firewall rules may lead to data exfiltration,
  unintentional exposure of internal services, and increased attack surface. By limiting
  egress traffic, organizations can prevent unauthorized data flow and comply with
  regulatory mandates such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, which require stringent data protection
  measures.
description: This rule evaluates GCP firewall settings to ensure that egress traffic
  is restricted to necessary destinations. Check for overly permissive egress rules,
  such as allowing traffic to 0.0.0.0/0. To remediate, configure specific egress rules
  that only permit traffic to known, trusted IP ranges and ports required for business
  operations. Regularly review and update these rules to adapt to evolving threats.
