title: Control Instance Auto-Placement for Managed Deployments
rationale: Controlling the auto-placement of compute instances is vital to ensure
  workloads are deployed in specific zones or regions, which can help meet data residency
  requirements, optimize resource utilization, and reduce latency. Uncontrolled placement
  may lead to compliance violations and inefficient resource allocation, impacting
  performance and incurring unnecessary costs.
description: This rule checks that Google Cloud Compute Engine instances are configured
  with controlled auto-placement settings. Specifically, instances should have constraints
  set to deploy in designated zones or regions based on organizational policies. Verify
  by reviewing instance configurations in the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud
  commands. Remediation involves setting the desired zone or region during instance
  creation or updating existing instances to adhere to placement policies.
