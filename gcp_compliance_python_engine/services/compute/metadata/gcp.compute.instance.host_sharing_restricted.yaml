title: Restrict Shared Host Usage for Compute Instances
rationale: Restricting host sharing for compute instances minimizes the risk of cross-tenant
  data leakage and potential side-channel attacks. It enhances data protection and
  isolation, which is critical for maintaining confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
  workloads. This practice is particularly important for compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict data isolation controls.
description: This rule checks whether Google Cloud Compute Instances are configured
  to restrict host sharing by using sole-tenant nodes. Sole-tenant nodes ensure that
  your instances do not share physical hardware with instances from other projects,
  reducing the risk of resource contention and vulnerabilities. To verify this, review
  your instance settings in the GCP Console or via the gcloud CLI and configure instances
  to utilize sole-tenant nodes if necessary. Remediation involves updating instance
  settings to select a specific node group dedicated to your project's instances.
