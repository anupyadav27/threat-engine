title: Restrict RDP Access in GCP Firewall Rules
rationale: Unrestricted RDP access over the internet can expose your instances to
  unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and system compromise. Limiting
  RDP access aligns with best practices for minimizing attack vectors and meets compliance
  requirements for secure network access control.
description: This rule verifies that GCP firewall rules do not allow unrestricted
  RDP (TCP port 3389) access from the internet. It checks for firewall rules permitting
  `0.0.0.0/0` as a source for RDP. To remediate, configure the firewall rules to allow
  RDP access only from specific IP addresses or ranges. This can be done by updating
  source ranges in the GCP Console or using gcloud commands.
