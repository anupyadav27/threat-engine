title: Prevent Cross-Account Restore for Compute Snapshots
rationale: Preventing cross-account restores of snapshots is crucial to minimizing
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By enforcing policies that restrict
  such actions, organizations can ensure that sensitive data remains within the intended
  account boundaries, reducing the risk of data leakage and aiding in compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks for policies that block cross-account restoration of
  Compute Engine snapshots, ensuring that snapshots cannot be restored in unauthorized
  accounts. To verify compliance, ensure that IAM policies and organization policies
  are configured to restrict snapshot sharing and restoration to trusted accounts
  only. Remediation involves reviewing and updating policy configurations in the GCP
  Console, ensuring proper permissions are set to prevent unauthorized data access.
