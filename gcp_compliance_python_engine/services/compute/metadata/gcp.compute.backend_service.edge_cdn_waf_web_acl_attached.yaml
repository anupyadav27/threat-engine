title: Ensure Edge CDN WAF Web ACL is Attached to Backend Service
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) ACL to an Edge CDN backend service
  helps protect web applications from common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site
  scripting, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. This enhances security by inspecting
  traffic and blocking malicious requests, reducing the risk of data breaches and
  ensuring compliance with security standards like PCI-DSS and NIST.
description: This rule checks if a Web ACL is attached to a backend service in GCP's
  Edge CDN. Without this configuration, backend services are vulnerable to web-based
  attacks. To verify, inspect the backend service's configuration in the GCP Console
  or via the gcloud CLI to ensure a WAF Web ACL is associated. Remediation involves
  configuring or attaching an existing Web ACL to the backend service, which can be
  done through the Cloud Armor interface in the console.
