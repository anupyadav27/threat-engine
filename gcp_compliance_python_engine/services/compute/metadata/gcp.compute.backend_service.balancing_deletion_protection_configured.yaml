title: Ensure Backend Service Deletion Protection is Configured
rationale: Deletion protection on backend services prevents accidental or unauthorized
  deletion, which could lead to service downtime and disrupt business operations.
  By configuring deletion protection, organizations mitigate the risk of data loss
  and service interruption, which is crucial for maintaining customer trust and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that deletion protection is enabled for Google Cloud
  Platform compute backend services. Deletion protection ensures that these services
  cannot be deleted without explicit consent, reducing the risk of accidental disruptions.
  To check this setting, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select the backend
  service, and verify that deletion protection is activated. If not enabled, update
  the service settings to enable deletion protection.
