title: Restrict VM Serial Console Access on Compute Instances
rationale: Restricting VM serial console access is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  users from accessing sensitive information or executing commands on virtual machines.
  Unrestricted access could lead to potential data breaches, unauthorized configurations,
  and compromise of critical workloads, impacting business continuity and compliance
  with standards like ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if serial console access is disabled for GCP Compute
  instances. By default, the VM serial console should be disabled as it allows users
  to connect to the VM even if they do not have SSH access. To verify, ensure the
  'enable-serial-port' metadata is set to false on instances. Remediation involves
  updating the instance metadata to disable serial port access, which can be done
  via the GCP Console, CLI, or API.
