title: Ensure Compute Instances are SSM Managed
rationale: Configuring instances to be SSM managed enhances security by allowing centralized
  management and automation of patching, configuration, and compliance policies, reducing
  the risk of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. This is critical for maintaining
  the integrity and security of workloads and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks if Google Compute Engine instances are managed by AWS
  Systems Manager (SSM), which allows for automated patching, monitoring, and configuration
  management. To verify, ensure that the SSM agent is installed and configured correctly
  on each instance. Remediation involves installing the SSM agent on instances and
  configuring the necessary IAM roles for SSM access, facilitating efficient management
  and security compliance.
