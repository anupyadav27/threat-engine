rule_id: gcp.compute.url_map.network_lb_listener_tls_min_1_2
service: compute
resource: url_map
requirement: Network Lb Listener TLS Min 1 2
scope: compute.url_map.network_security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Use TLS 1.2 or Higher for Network LB Listener on URL Maps
rationale: Ensuring TLS 1.2 or higher for Network Load Balancer listeners mitigates
  risks from outdated encryption protocols, protecting data in transit from interception
  and tampering. This is essential for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of data, meeting compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, and preventing
  potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks that Network Load Balancer listeners associated with
  URL maps enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have known vulnerabilities
  that can be exploited by attackers. To verify, inspect the URL map configurations
  in the GCP Console or via the gcloud CLI, ensuring 'minTlsVersion' is set to 'TLS_1_2'.
  If not compliant, update the configuration to enforce TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure
  secure communications.
