title: Ensure URL Map Edge Rule Has Action Beyond Count Only
rationale: Using 'count only' as the sole action in URL map edge rules can lead to
  inadequate response measures against potential threats. This configuration might
  result in missed opportunities for automated security enforcement, increasing the
  risk of malicious traffic going unchecked and potentially impacting application
  availability and data integrity.
description: This rule checks URL map edge rules to ensure that they include actions
  beyond 'count only'. Edge rules should be configured with effective actions such
  as 'deny', 'redirect', or 'allow' to actively manage and mitigate malicious traffic.
  To verify, inspect the URL map configurations in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI
  for edge rules without effective actions and update them accordingly to enhance
  security measures.
