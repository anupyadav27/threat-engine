title: Unassigned IP Addresses in Google Compute Engine
rationale: Unassigned IP addresses in Google Compute Engine can lead to inefficient
  resource utilization and increased costs. They may also pose a security risk if
  accidentally re-assigned to unauthorized or malicious workloads, potentially enabling
  network exploitation or unauthorized access to resources. Proper management of IP
  addresses is crucial for compliance with resource governance and budgetary controls.
description: This rule checks for IP addresses in Google Compute Engine that have
  been allocated but are not currently assigned to any resource. Unassigned IP addresses
  should be regularly reviewed and released if not in use to prevent unnecessary charges.
  To remediate, identify unassigned IP addresses via the GCP Console or CLI and release
  them using the 'gcloud compute addresses delete' command or the Console UI to avoid
  incurring charges.
