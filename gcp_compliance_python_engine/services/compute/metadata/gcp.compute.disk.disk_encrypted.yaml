title: Ensure Compute Engine Disks are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting disks at rest protects sensitive data from unauthorized access
  and potential breaches, particularly if a disk is improperly decommissioned. This
  is critical for compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and helps
  mitigate risks associated with data exposure or loss, ensuring that sensitive information
  remains secure even if physical security controls are bypassed.
description: This rule checks whether Compute Engine disks are encrypted using Google-managed
  encryption keys or customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). To verify, review the
  disk's properties in the GCP Console or use the `gcloud compute disks describe`
  command to check the 'encryption' field. Remediation involves enabling encryption
  for all disks during creation or updating existing disks with encryption by moving
  data to a new encrypted disk.
