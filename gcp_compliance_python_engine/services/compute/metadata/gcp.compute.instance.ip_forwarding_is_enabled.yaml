title: Enable IP Forwarding for Compute Instances
rationale: IP forwarding is crucial for routing network traffic beyond the local instance,
  enabling it for specific instances can enhance network management but poses a security
  risk if enabled unnecessarily. Improper configuration can expose the instance to
  unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or network misuse. Compliance with
  network security standards requires careful control of IP forwarding settings.
description: This rule checks if IP forwarding is enabled on Google Compute Engine
  instances, which should only be activated for instances acting as gateways or routers.
  Verification involves reviewing instance configurations to ensure IP forwarding
  is only enabled where necessary. Remediation includes disabling IP forwarding on
  instances where it is not required, thereby reducing attack surfaces and improving
  security posture.
