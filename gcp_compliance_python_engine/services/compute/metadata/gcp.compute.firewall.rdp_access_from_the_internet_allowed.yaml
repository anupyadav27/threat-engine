title: Restrict RDP Access from the Internet in GCP Firewall
rationale: Allowing unrestricted RDP access from the internet can expose your virtual
  machines to unauthorized access and potential attacks such as brute force or exploitation
  of RDP vulnerabilities. This poses a risk to sensitive data and critical systems,
  potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations with standards like
  PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks for firewall rules that allow RDP access (TCP port 3389)
  from any IP address on the internet. It is recommended to restrict RDP access to
  specific IP addresses or ranges associated with trusted networks or VPNs. To remediate,
  modify the firewall rule to limit RDP access to known IP addresses or implement
  a bastion host to control access securely.
