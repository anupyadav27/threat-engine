title: Disable Serial Port Access on Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling serial port access on virtual machines can expose sensitive information
  and increase the risk of unauthorized access, as attackers can exploit this to gain
  insights into system operations or bypass security controls. Disabling this feature
  helps in adhering to security best practices and compliance requirements, such as
  PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which emphasize minimizing unnecessary exposure of system
  interfaces.
description: This rule checks whether serial port access is disabled on Google Compute
  Engine instances. Serial port access should be restricted as it can be used to expose
  sensitive data and configuration details. To verify, ensure that 'enable-serial-port'
  is set to 'false' in the instance metadata. Remediation involves updating the instance
  settings via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool to set 'enable-serial-port'
  to 'false'.
