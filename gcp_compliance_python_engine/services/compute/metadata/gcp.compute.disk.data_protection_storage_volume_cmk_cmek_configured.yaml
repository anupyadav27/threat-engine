title: Ensure CMEK Configured for Compute Engine Disks
rationale: Configuring Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for Compute Engine
  disks enhances control over cryptographic operations and key management policies,
  thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. It also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements for data protection and privacy regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strong data encryption standards.
description: This rule checks if Compute Engine disks are configured with Customer
  Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) rather than using Google-managed keys. To verify,
  ensure that the 'kmsKeyName' property is set for each disk resource. If not configured,
  update the disk configuration to specify a suitable CMEK, leveraging Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS) to create and manage cryptographic keys. This configuration provides
  enhanced security by allowing organizations to manage their own encryption keys.
