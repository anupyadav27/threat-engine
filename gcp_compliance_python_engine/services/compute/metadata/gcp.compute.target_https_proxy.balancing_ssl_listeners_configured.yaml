title: Ensure SSL Listeners Configured for HTTPS Proxies
rationale: Configuring SSL listeners for target HTTPS proxies is critical to encrypt
  data in transit, preventing unauthorized interception and data breaches. Without
  SSL, data is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to sensitive
  information exposure. This configuration also aligns with compliance requirements
  for data protection and privacy, such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that all target HTTPS proxies have SSL listeners properly
  configured to ensure secure communication. To verify, inspect the target HTTPS proxy
  settings in your GCP environment and ensure that SSL certificates are applied to
  each listener. Remediation involves updating the proxy configuration to include
  valid SSL certificates and enforcing HTTPS for all incoming requests.
