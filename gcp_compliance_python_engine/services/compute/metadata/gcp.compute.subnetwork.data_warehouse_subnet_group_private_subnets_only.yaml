title: Ensure Data Warehouse Subnets Are Private Only
rationale: Limiting Data Warehouse subnets to private IP addresses minimizes exposure
  to the internet, reducing risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This is
  crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and meeting compliance requirements
  like PCI-DSS and GDPR, which mandate strict controls over access to sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that subnets within the Data Warehouse subnet group
  are configured to use private IP ranges only. Verify that 'IPV6 access type' is
  set to 'INTERNAL' and no external IP addresses are assigned. To remediate, ensure
  that all subnets in the Data Warehouse group are created with 'Private Google Access'
  enabled and do not attach external IPs to any instances within these subnets.
