title: Restrict Inbound Traffic to VM Instances
rationale: Restricting inbound traffic to VM instances reduces the attack surface,
  preventing unauthorized access and potential breaches. This control is crucial for
  safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining compliance with security frameworks
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strict network access controls.
description: This rule checks that security groups associated with VM instances in
  Google Cloud Platform have restrictive inbound rules, allowing only necessary traffic.
  It verifies that no overly permissive rules (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 allowing all IPs) exist,
  especially for sensitive ports like SSH (22) or RDP (3389). Remediation involves
  reviewing and updating firewall rules to specify only trusted IP ranges for inbound
  access, utilizing identity-aware proxies or VPNs where feasible.
