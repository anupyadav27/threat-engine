title: Restrict Firewall Rules from Allowing Open Network Access
rationale: Allowing unrestricted network access poses significant security risks,
  including unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential exploitation by attackers.
  This can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liabilities, especially
  if sensitive data is exposed. Ensuring firewall rules do not permit all traffic
  is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment.
description: This rule checks for firewall configurations that allow open access (0.0.0.0/0)
  to networks. It verifies that firewall rules are not set to 'allow' all inbound
  or outbound traffic without proper restrictions. Remediation involves reviewing
  firewall rules and limiting access to specific IP ranges, services, or protocols
  as per business requirements. For verification, review firewall rule settings in
  the Google Cloud Console under 'VPC Network > Firewall'.
