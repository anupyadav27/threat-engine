title: Avoid Using Legacy Networks in GCP Compute
rationale: Legacy networks in GCP lack granular control over network security policies,
  which increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Utilizing modern
  network configurations enhances the ability to implement tighter access controls
  and comply with regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Failure to update
  legacy networks could lead to security vulnerabilities and non-compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This rule checks for the presence of legacy networks configured within
  GCP Compute environments. Legacy networks do not support subnetting or modern firewall
  rules, which are critical for fine-grained access control. To verify, navigate to
  the VPC Networks section in the GCP Console and ensure no networks are labeled as
  'legacy'. Remediation involves migrating legacy networks to VPC networks, which
  offer improved security features and manageability.
