title: Enable HTTPS Logging for GCP Compute Backend Services
rationale: Enabling HTTPS logging for backend services in GCP is critical for monitoring
  and auditing traffic patterns, detecting anomalies, and ensuring compliance with
  regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and SOC2. Without HTTPS logging, organizations
  may miss crucial insights into service usage, potentially leading to unmonitored
  security breaches or non-compliance issues.
description: This rule checks whether HTTPS logging is enabled for Google Cloud Platform
  Compute Backend Services. To verify, ensure that the 'logConfig.enable' field is
  set to true in the backend service's configuration. Remediation involves updating
  the backend service settings to enable logging, which can be done via the GCP Console,
  gcloud command-line tool, or Terraform scripts. This setup allows for detailed logging
  of HTTP(S) requests, facilitating enhanced security monitoring and auditing.
