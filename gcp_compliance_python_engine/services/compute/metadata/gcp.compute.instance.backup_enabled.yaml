title: Ensure Backup is Enabled for Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling backups for Compute instances is crucial for data resilience and
  business continuity. In the event of accidental deletion, corruption, or a security
  breach, having backups ensures that critical data can be restored, minimizing downtime
  and potential financial losses. Moreover, backups help meet regulatory compliance
  requirements, such as those specified by PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate data
  protection and recovery strategies.
description: This rule checks that Compute Engine instances have backup mechanisms,
  such as snapshots or persistent disk backup policies, properly configured. To verify,
  ensure that instance disks have scheduled snapshots or are part of a managed backup
  plan. Remediation involves setting up Cloud Scheduler to automate disk snapshots
  or using Google Cloud's Backup and DR service to configure a backup policy that
  aligns with your RPO and RTO objectives.
