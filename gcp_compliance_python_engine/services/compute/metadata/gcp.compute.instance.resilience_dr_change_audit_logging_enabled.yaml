title: Ensure Audit Logging for DR Changes on Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling audit logging for disaster recovery (DR) changes on compute instances
  is crucial to track and understand changes that could impact system resilience.
  Without logging, unauthorized or accidental modifications may go unnoticed, potentially
  leading to increased downtime or data loss. This practice supports compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and assists in forensic investigations.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for changes related
  to disaster recovery on GCP Compute Engine instances. To verify, ensure that the
  necessary audit logs are enabled in Google Cloud's IAM & Admin under Audit Logs
  for Compute Engine. Remediation involves configuring the logging settings to include
  'ADMIN_READ' and 'DATA_WRITE' log types for the 'compute.googleapis.com' service,
  thus capturing relevant DR configuration changes.
