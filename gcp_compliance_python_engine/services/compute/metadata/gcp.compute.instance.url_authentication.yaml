title: Enable Secure URL Authentication for GCP Compute Instances
rationale: Enabling secure URL authentication on GCP Compute Instances mitigates the
  risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources. It prevents potential data breaches
  and unauthorized usage, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA. Failing to secure URL endpoints can lead to exposure of critical services,
  impacting business operations and customer trust.
description: This rule checks that GCP Compute Instances have URL authentication mechanisms
  properly configured. It ensures that only authorized users and applications can
  access instance endpoints via secure URLs. Verification involves reviewing instance
  metadata and network configuration settings to confirm authentication is enabled.
  Remediation includes configuring IAM policies to restrict access and implementing
  OAuth 2.0 or signed URLs for additional security.
