title: Ensure Compute Instance Resilience DR Logs are Enabled
rationale: Enabling resilience disaster recovery (DR) logging for compute instances
  is crucial for maintaining business continuity during unforeseen events. These logs
  provide critical insights into system performance and data recovery processes, helping
  to mitigate risks such as data loss or extended downtime. Additionally, they support
  compliance with industry regulations that require logging and monitoring of disaster
  recovery activities.
description: This rule checks if resilience disaster recovery logs are enabled on
  GCP Compute Engine instances. To verify, ensure that the Compute Engine instances
  are configured to send logs to Google Cloud Logging by enabling the 'logs' field
  in the VM instance's metadata or by using the --logging flag during instance creation.
  Remediation involves updating instance configurations to include logging settings
  that capture DR activities, which can be achieved through the Google Cloud Console
  or gcloud command-line tool.
