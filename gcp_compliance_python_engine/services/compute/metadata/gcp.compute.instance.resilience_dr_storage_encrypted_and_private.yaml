service: compute
resource: instance
requirement: Resilience DR Storage Encrypted And Private
scope: compute.instance.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Compute Instance DR Storage is Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encryption of data at rest is crucial to protect sensitive information
  from unauthorized access, especially in disaster recovery scenarios. Unencrypted
  or publicly accessible storage can lead to data breaches, compromising confidentiality
  and integrity. Compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often mandates
  encryption to safeguard data and maintain trust.
description: This rule checks that all disaster recovery storage associated with compute
  instances in GCP is encrypted and not publicly accessible. Ensure that Compute Engine
  instances use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed keys for
  all attached disks and that these disks are not shared with public IPs or unauthorized
  networks. Remediation involves configuring disk encryption settings in the GCP Console
  or using the gcloud CLI, and setting firewall rules to restrict access.
