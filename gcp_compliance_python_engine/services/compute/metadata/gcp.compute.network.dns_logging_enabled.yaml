title: Ensure DNS Logging is Enabled for GCP Networks
rationale: Enabling DNS logging on Google Cloud Platform networks allows for comprehensive
  visibility into DNS queries, which is crucial for detecting and responding to potential
  security threats such as data exfiltration or network attacks. It helps in auditing
  and monitoring network activities for compliance with regulations like GDPR and
  PCI DSS, which mandate detailed logging for data protection and integrity.
description: This rule checks if DNS logging is enabled for networks within Google
  Cloud Platform. DNS logs provide valuable insights into network traffic, helping
  identify unusual patterns or unauthorized access. To verify, review the network's
  logging configuration in the Google Cloud Console or use the gcloud command-line
  tool. Remediation involves enabling DNS logging in the network settings under the
  'Logging' section, ensuring that logs are sent to a designated Cloud Logging project
  for analysis and storage.
