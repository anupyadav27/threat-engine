title: Ensure Crypto Key Rotation Policy is Configured
rationale: Regular rotation of cryptographic keys is crucial for maintaining security
  hygiene and minimizing the risk of key compromise. Without a defined rotation policy,
  keys may remain vulnerable to prolonged exposure, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized
  access. Compliance with standards like NIST and PCI-DSS often requires key rotation
  to ensure ongoing data protection and integrity.
description: This rule checks if a rotation policy is set for each Cloud KMS crypto
  key, ensuring keys are automatically rotated at regular intervals. To verify, review
  the 'rotationPeriod' field in the crypto key's properties; it should be configured
  to a period that aligns with your security policy (e.g., every 90 days). To remediate,
  update the crypto key settings to include an appropriate 'rotationPeriod' using
  the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI.
