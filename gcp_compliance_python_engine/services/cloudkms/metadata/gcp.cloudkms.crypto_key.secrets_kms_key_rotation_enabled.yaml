title: Enable Rotation for Secrets KMS Crypto Keys
rationale: Regular key rotation for Secrets KMS keys reduces the risk of key compromise
  by limiting the exposure of cryptographic keys over time. It aligns with compliance
  mandates such as PCI-DSS and NIST SP 800-57, which require periodic key changes
  to enhance security posture and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
description: This rule verifies that all CryptoKeys used for secrets management have
  automatic rotation enabled in Google Cloud KMS. Automatic key rotation helps to
  mitigate the risk of key exposure and ensures keys are regularly updated without
  manual intervention. To remediate, set a rotation period for each CryptoKey using
  the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI, specifying a rotation period of no more
  than 365 days.
