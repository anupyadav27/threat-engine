title: Ensure TLS 1.2+ for Cloud KMS Crypto Key Encryption
rationale: Using a minimum of TLS 1.2 for encryption in transit protects sensitive
  key material from interception and man-in-the-middle attacks, which can lead to
  unauthorized data access and breaches. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of cryptographic operations and adhering to compliance standards like
  PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that Google Cloud KMS Crypto Keys are using at least
  TLS 1.2 for encryption in transit. To verify, inspect the network configuration
  settings to ensure TLS 1.2 or higher is enforced. Remediation involves updating
  the TLS policies and ensuring all clients and services interacting with Cloud KMS
  support TLS 1.2 or newer versions. It is essential to regularly review and update
  configurations to comply with industry standards and best practices.
