title: Ensure Cloud KMS Key Ring Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging for Cloud KMS key rings is crucial for monitoring access
  and changes to encryption keys. Without logging, unauthorized access or misuse of
  keys might go unnoticed, posing a significant security risk. Compliance with frameworks
  like PCI-DSS and HIPAA requires detailed record-keeping of key management activities
  to ensure data protection and accountability.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Cloud KMS key rings to
  track all access and modifications. To ensure logging is active, check that key
  ring activity is being recorded in Cloud Audit Logs. Remediation involves configuring
  the appropriate logging settings in the Google Cloud Console under the 'Logging'
  section for each key ring, ensuring audit logs are set to capture 'Admin Read',
  'Admin Write', and 'Data Access' events.
