title: Implement and Maintain KMS Key Lifecycle Management
rationale: Proper lifecycle management of Cloud KMS keys is critical to ensuring data
  privacy and security. Without automated rotation and expiration policies, keys may
  become vulnerable to unauthorized access or cryptographic attacks, potentially leading
  to data breaches. Compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often mandates
  strict key management practices to protect sensitive information.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud KMS keys have a defined lifecycle policy
  that includes key rotation and expiration schedules. Ensure each key has a 'nextRotationTime'
  and 'rotationPeriod' set to enforce automatic key rotation, reducing the risk of
  key compromise. Remediation involves configuring the key with a rotation period,
  typically every 90 days, via the GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool. Verify
  lifecycle settings by reviewing key properties in the Cloud KMS section of the GCP
  Console.
