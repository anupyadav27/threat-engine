title: Ensure CMK Rotation is Enabled for Crypto Keys
rationale: Regular rotation of Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) mitigates the risk of
  data breaches and unauthorized access by limiting the lifespan of any single encryption
  key. This practice is crucial for maintaining compliance with data protection regulations
  like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate robust encryption management policies to safeguard
  sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether CMK rotation is enabled for Google Cloud KMS
  crypto keys. Enabling automatic rotation helps in minimizing potential exposure
  by automatically generating new encryption keys at regular intervals. To verify
  this setting, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, go to Cloud KMS, select the
  crypto key, and ensure the 'Rotation period' is configured. If not enabled, set
  an appropriate rotation period, such as 90 days, to enhance security posture.
