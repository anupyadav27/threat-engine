title: Ensure Cloud KMS Crypto Keys are Encrypted
rationale: Ensuring encryption for Cloud KMS keys protects sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and potential breaches. Encryption is critical for maintaining data integrity
  and confidentiality, mitigating risks associated with data exposure. Compliance
  with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often mandates encryption, ensuring that
  businesses meet legal requirements and avoid financial and reputational damages.
description: This rule checks that Cloud KMS crypto keys are encrypted using appropriate
  algorithms. Ensure that all crypto keys are set up with encryption at rest enabled.
  Verification involves inspecting the key's configuration in the Google Cloud Console
  or via the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation includes configuring or updating
  crypto keys to enforce encryption settings. Use the GCP Console or gcloud commands
  to verify and adjust settings as needed.
