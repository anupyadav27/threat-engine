title: Ensure Expiration is Set for Cloud KMS Crypto Keys
rationale: Setting an expiration date for Cloud KMS crypto keys is crucial to prevent
  the use of outdated keys, which can pose security risks such as unauthorized access
  to encrypted data. It helps in managing key lifecycle effectively, reducing the
  risk of key compromise and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  such as PCI-DSS and NIST SP 800-57, which mandate key rotation and expiration strategies.
description: This rule checks whether an expiration date is set for all Cloud KMS
  crypto keys. By configuring an expiration date, organizations can ensure that keys
  are rotated or decommissioned after their intended usage period, preventing potential
  misuse. To verify, review the Cloud KMS key properties in the GCP Console or via
  gcloud command-line tool. Remediate by setting an expiration date through the GCP
  Console or using the gcloud command-line tool with the 'expiration-time' parameter.
