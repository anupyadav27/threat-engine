title: Ensure Cloud KMS Crypto Key Rotation is Enabled
rationale: Enabling key rotation for Cloud KMS crypto keys reduces the risk of key
  compromise by limiting the duration a key is used to encrypt data. This practice
  is critical for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially in environments
  with high compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, where regular key rotation
  is mandated to protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if automatic rotation is enabled for Cloud KMS crypto
  keys, which should be configured to rotate at least every 90 days. To verify, navigate
  to the Cloud KMS section in the GCP Console, select the crypto key, and check the
  rotation schedule settings. To enable rotation, set an automatic rotation schedule
  through the GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool. Regularly rotated keys minimize
  exposure time and help adhere to compliance standards.
