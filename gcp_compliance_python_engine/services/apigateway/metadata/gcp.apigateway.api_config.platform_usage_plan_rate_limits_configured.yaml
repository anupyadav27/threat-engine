title: API Gateway Rate Limits for Usage Plans Configured
rationale: Configuring platform usage plan rate limits for API Gateway ensures that
  APIs are protected against denial-of-service attacks and prevents overconsumption
  of resources, which could lead to increased costs and potential service disruptions.
  By setting appropriate rate limits, organizations can improve the reliability and
  availability of their services while adhering to compliance requirements for resource
  usage management.
description: This rule checks if usage plans in API Gateway have rate limits configured
  to control the number of requests that can be made to an API. Proper configuration
  involves setting both request and burst limits to safeguard against traffic spikes.
  To verify, inspect the API Gateway configurations for set usage plans and ensure
  they include defined request quotas. Remediation involves using the GCP Console
  or gcloud CLI to define rate limits in the API configurations, thus ensuring robust
  traffic management.
