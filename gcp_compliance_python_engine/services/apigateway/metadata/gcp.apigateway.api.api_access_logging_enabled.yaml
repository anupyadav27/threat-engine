title: Ensure API Gateway Access Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling access logging for API Gateway is crucial for monitoring API usage,
  detecting unauthorized access attempts, and conducting forensic investigations in
  case of security incidents. It aids in compliance with regulatory requirements like
  GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA, which mandate detailed access logs to ensure accountability
  and data protection.
description: This rule checks if access logging is enabled for API Gateway resources
  in GCP. Without access logging, you may miss critical insights into API usage patterns
  and potential security threats. To verify, navigate to the API Gateway settings
  in the GCP Console and ensure that logging is activated. Remediation involves enabling
  logging by configuring the API Gateway to send logs to Cloud Logging, ensuring all
  access requests are logged and monitored.
