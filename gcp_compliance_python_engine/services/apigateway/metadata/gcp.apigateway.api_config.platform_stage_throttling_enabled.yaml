title: Enable Throttling for API Gateway Configurations
rationale: Enabling throttling on API Gateway configurations helps prevent abuse and
  overuse of APIs, which can lead to service degradation or denial of service. It
  ensures that APIs are only used within the limits intended by the organization,
  protecting backend services from excessive load and potential security threats.
  Compliance with regulations like NIST and PCI-DSS often requires such controls to
  manage access and protect data integrity.
description: This rule checks if throttling is enabled on the API Gateway platform
  for each API configuration. Throttling controls the rate of requests to ensure API
  stability and security. To verify, check the API Gateway settings for configured
  limits on requests per second. If throttling is not enabled, configure it by setting
  appropriate limits in the GCP Console under the API Gateway configuration section.
  This helps mitigate risks of API misuse and supports compliance with security standards.
