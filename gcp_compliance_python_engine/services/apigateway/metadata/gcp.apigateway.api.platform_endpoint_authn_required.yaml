title: Ensure API Gateway Uses Endpoint Authentication
rationale: Requiring authentication for API Gateway endpoints is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to APIs, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data
  manipulation. It helps in complying with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate secure access controls for sensitive data. Without authentication,
  APIs are vulnerable to abuse, potentially impacting business operations and customer
  trust.
description: This rule checks if API Gateway endpoints require authentication to ensure
  that only authorized users can access the API resources. To verify, inspect the
  API Gateway configurations to ensure that authentication mechanisms such as OAuth
  2.0 or API keys are enabled. Remediation involves configuring the API Gateway to
  require authentication by setting up a proper authentication provider and associating
  it with the API endpoint.
