title: Enable Logging for API Gateway REST APIs
rationale: Enabling logging for API Gateway REST APIs is crucial for monitoring and
  forensic analysis. Without logging, detecting and investigating security incidents
  such as unauthorized access or data breaches becomes challenging, potentially leading
  to compliance issues with frameworks like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for API Gateway REST APIs in Google
  Cloud Platform. Logging should be configured to capture all relevant request and
  response metadata to facilitate auditing and troubleshooting. To enable logging,
  navigate to the API Gateway console, select the API, and configure the logging settings
  to send logs to Cloud Logging. Regularly review and analyze these logs for unusual
  activities.
