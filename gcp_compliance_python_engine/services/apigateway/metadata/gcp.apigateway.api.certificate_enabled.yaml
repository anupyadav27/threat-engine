title: Ensure Certificates are Enabled for API Gateway
rationale: Enabling certificates for API Gateway ensures secure communication between
  clients and the API, protecting sensitive data from interception and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This is crucial for maintaining data privacy and integrity, especially
  for APIs handling personal or sensitive data, and is often required for compliance
  with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if SSL/TLS certificates are enabled for API Gateway
  endpoints, ensuring encrypted data transmission. To verify, confirm that API Gateway
  configurations include SSL/TLS certificates for all endpoints. Remediation involves
  configuring API Gateway with a valid SSL/TLS certificate, which can be obtained
  from a trusted Certificate Authority or managed through Google Cloud's Certificate
  Manager.
