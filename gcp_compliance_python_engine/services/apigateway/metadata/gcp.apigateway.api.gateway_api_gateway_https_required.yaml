title: Ensure HTTPS is Enabled for API Gateway Endpoints
rationale: Using HTTPS for API Gateway endpoints is crucial to protect the data in
  transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring the confidentiality
  and integrity of information exchanged. This is especially important for APIs handling
  sensitive data or personal information, as it helps organizations comply with regulatory
  standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA, which mandate secure data transmission.
description: This rule checks if API Gateway endpoints are configured to use HTTPS
  protocols. Configuring HTTPS involves setting up SSL/TLS certificates for secure
  communication. To verify, review the API Gateway settings to ensure 'https' is specified
  in the gateway URL. Remediation involves updating the gateway configuration to include
  SSL certificates and enforcing HTTPS-only connections, which can be done via the
  GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool.
