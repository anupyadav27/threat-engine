title: Ensure TLS 1.2+ for API Gateway Platform Authorizer
rationale: Enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher for API Gateway Platform Authorizer is crucial
  for protecting data in transit. Using outdated TLS versions exposes APIs to vulnerabilities
  such as man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized data access
  and breaches. Ensuring compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS and NIST
  enhances trust and security posture.
description: This rule verifies that the API Gateway Platform Authorizer is configured
  to enforce a minimum of TLS 1.2 for securing communications. Check the API Gateway
  configuration settings to ensure TLS 1.2 or higher is specified. Remediation involves
  updating the API Gateway settings to disable lower TLS versions, ensuring that only
  secure connections are permitted.
