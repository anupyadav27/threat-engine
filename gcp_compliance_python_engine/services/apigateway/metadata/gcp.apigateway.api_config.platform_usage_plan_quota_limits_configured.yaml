title: Ensure API Gateway Usage Plan Quotas Are Configured
rationale: Configuring usage plan quotas for API Gateway is critical to control and
  limit the usage of your APIs, preventing misuse and potential denial of service
  attacks. It helps in managing costs by avoiding unexpected high usage and ensuring
  fair usage across different clients, aligning with compliance requirements for resource
  management and availability.
description: This rule checks whether usage plan quotas are configured for API Gateway
  on GCP. Quotas should be set to restrict the number of requests or data that can
  be sent through your APIs. To verify, review the API configuration settings in the
  GCP Console under API Gateway and ensure quotas are defined and active. Remediation
  involves setting appropriate quotas via the GCP Console or API to enforce limits
  according to your operational and security needs.
