title: Ensure DNS Zone Transfers are Securely Configured
rationale: Restricting DNS zone transfers is crucial as it prevents unauthorized replication
  of DNS data, which could lead to data exfiltration, DNS hijacking, or other malicious
  activities. Ensuring zone transfers are restricted or require TSIG (Transaction
  Signature) helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality, aligning with compliance
  mandates such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that DNS managed zones have zone transfers either restricted
  to specific authorized IP addresses or secured using TSIG. To verify, review the
  DNS managed zone settings in GCP to ensure 'allowTransfer' is set to authorized
  IPs or TSIG keys. Remediation involves configuring these settings via the GCP Console
  or Terraform, ensuring that only trusted DNS servers can perform zone transfers.
