title: Use Stronger DNSSEC Signing Algorithm in Managed Zones
rationale: Using RSASHA1 for DNSSEC signing poses security risks due to its known
  vulnerabilities and susceptibility to cryptographic attacks. This can lead to DNS
  spoofing, data integrity issues, and potential compliance violations with security
  standards that require the use of stronger cryptographic methods. Transitioning
  to more secure algorithms like RSASHA256 or RSASHA512 helps mitigate these threats
  and aligns with industry best practices.
description: This rule checks if RSASHA1 is being used for DNSSEC signing in GCP managed
  zones. RSASHA1 is considered weak and should be replaced with stronger algorithms
  such as RSASHA256 or RSASHA512. To verify, inspect the DNSSEC configuration in the
  Cloud Console or via gcloud commands to ensure that a more secure algorithm is used.
  Remediation involves updating the DNSSEC settings in the Google Cloud Console or
  using the gcloud dns managed-zones update command to configure a stronger signing
  algorithm.
