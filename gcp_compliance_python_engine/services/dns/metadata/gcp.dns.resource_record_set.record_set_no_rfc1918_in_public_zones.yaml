title: Prevent RFC1918 Addresses in Public DNS Zones
rationale: Exposing private IP addresses such as RFC1918 addresses in public DNS zones
  can lead to unauthorized network exposure, allowing external entities to infer internal
  network structures. This can increase the risk of targeted attacks and may violate
  compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which emphasize minimizing
  exposure of internal network details.
description: This rule checks for the presence of RFC1918 private IP addresses in
  public DNS zones within GCP. RFC1918 addresses should be restricted to internal
  use and not published in publicly accessible DNS records. To verify, audit DNS records
  in public zones for compliance with this rule. Remediation involves removing or
  modifying any DNS records that expose RFC1918 addresses to ensure they are not publicly
  resolvable.
