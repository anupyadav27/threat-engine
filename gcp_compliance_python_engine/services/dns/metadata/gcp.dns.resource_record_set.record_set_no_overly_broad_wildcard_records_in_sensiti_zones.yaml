requirement: Record Set No Overly Broad Wildcard Records In Sensiti Zones
scope: dns.resource_record_set.security
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Avoid Broad Wildcard DNS Records in Sensitive Zones
rationale: Overly broad wildcard DNS records can lead to security risks such as domain
  hijacking and phishing attacks by resolving subdomains that should not exist. This
  can expose sensitive data and services unintentionally, impacting business integrity
  and compliance with frameworks like ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks for the presence of wildcard DNS records in sensitive
  zones within GCP Cloud DNS. Wildcard records that are too broad can unintentionally
  expose subdomains, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. To verify, examine
  DNS records and ensure wildcards are appropriately scoped. Remediation involves
  restricting wildcard usage to only necessary subdomains, or removing it entirely
  in sensitive environments.
