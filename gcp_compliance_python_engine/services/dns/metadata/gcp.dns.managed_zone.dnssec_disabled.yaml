title: Ensure DNSSEC is Enabled for Managed DNS Zones
rationale: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protect the integrity and authenticity
  of DNS responses, safeguarding against attacks such as cache poisoning and spoofing.
  Disabling DNSSEC in managed zones can expose an organization to potential unauthorized
  redirections and data breaches, impacting business operations and violating compliance
  standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if DNSSEC is disabled for Google Cloud DNS managed zones.
  DNSSEC should be enabled to provide an additional layer of security by digitally
  signing DNS responses. To verify, check the Cloud DNS settings for each managed
  zone and ensure DNSSEC is enabled. Remediation involves navigating to the Cloud
  DNS service in the GCP Console, selecting the managed zone, and enabling DNSSEC
  under the 'DNSSEC' section.
