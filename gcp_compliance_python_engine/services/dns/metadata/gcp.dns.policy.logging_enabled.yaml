title: Ensure DNS Policy Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging for DNS policies is crucial for monitoring and auditing
  DNS query activities, helping to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
  Without logging, identifying malicious queries, unauthorized changes, or misconfigurations
  becomes challenging, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with
  regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for DNS policies within your GCP
  environment. Logging should be configured to capture detailed DNS query logs, which
  can be verified through the Cloud Console or via the gcloud command-line tool. To
  enable logging, navigate to the Cloud DNS Policies section, edit the desired policy,
  and ensure the 'logConfig' is set to capture logs. This aids in maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail and supports incident response activities.
