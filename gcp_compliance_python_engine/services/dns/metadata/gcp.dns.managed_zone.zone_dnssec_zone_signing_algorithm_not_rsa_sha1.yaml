title: Avoid RSA-SHA1 for DNSSEC Zone Signing Algorithm
rationale: Using RSA-SHA1 for DNSSEC zone signing is risky due to its vulnerability
  to collision attacks, which can compromise the integrity and authenticity of DNS
  records. This can lead to DNS spoofing, where users are redirected to malicious
  sites, posing significant business risks and potential compliance violations, especially
  under frameworks like PCI-DSS and NIST.
description: This rule checks that the DNSSEC zone signing algorithm for GCP DNS managed
  zones is not set to RSA-SHA1, which is considered weak. Instead, use stronger algorithms
  like RSA-SHA256 or ECDSA to ensure robust cryptographic integrity. To verify, inspect
  the DNS managed zones in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI, and update the DNSSEC
  settings to use a more secure algorithm if necessary.
