title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in DNS Managed Zones
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of DNS managed zones is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to DNS configurations, which could lead to domain hijacking
  or malicious redirection of traffic. Unauthorized access can expose sensitive data,
  disrupt services, and compromise compliance with data protection regulations such
  as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks for DNS managed zones configured with cross-account
  sharing, which should be restricted to ensure only authorized accounts have access.
  Verify the IAM policy bindings of managed zones, ensuring that only trusted accounts
  and users have roles granting DNS management permissions. Remediation involves reviewing
  and modifying IAM policies to limit access to necessary accounts only, using least
  privilege principles.
