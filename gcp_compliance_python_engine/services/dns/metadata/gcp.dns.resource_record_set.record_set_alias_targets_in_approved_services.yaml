title: Ensure DNS Alias Targets Are Approved Services
rationale: Using unapproved services for DNS alias targets can expose your network
  to security risks, such as data breaches and unauthorized access, potentially violating
  regulatory requirements like PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Ensuring alias targets are restricted
  to approved services helps maintain control over data flow and mitigates the risk
  of routing traffic to compromised or malicious endpoints.
description: This rule checks that all DNS resource record sets within your Google
  Cloud account use alias targets that are part of an approved list of services. To
  verify, inspect the DNS configurations in Cloud DNS and ensure alias targets match
  approved services. Remediation involves updating any non-compliant alias targets
  to align with the organization's approved services list, preventing unauthorized
  or potentially malicious traffic redirection.
