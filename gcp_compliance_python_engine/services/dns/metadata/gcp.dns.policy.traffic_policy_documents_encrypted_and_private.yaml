requirement: Traffic Policy Documents Encrypted And Private
scope: dns.policy.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure DNS Traffic Policy Documents Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting DNS traffic policy documents is critical to protect sensitive
  configuration data from unauthorized access and breaches. Unencrypted data can be
  intercepted or tampered with, leading to potential compliance violations with regulations
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS. Ensuring privacy and encryption of these documents
  mitigates risks of data leaks and supports business reputation by safeguarding customer
  trust.
description: This rule checks that all DNS traffic policy documents are encrypted
  at rest using Google Cloud KMS and that access to these documents is restricted
  through IAM policies. To verify, ensure that the DNS policies have encryption enabled
  by default and review IAM roles to confirm that only authorized personnel have access.
  Remediation involves applying customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to your DNS
  policies and auditing IAM permissions regularly to maintain least privilege access.
