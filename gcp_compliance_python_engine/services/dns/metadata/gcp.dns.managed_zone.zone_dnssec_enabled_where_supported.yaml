title: Enable DNSSEC for Supported Managed Zones
rationale: Enabling DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) in supported managed zones helps
  protect against certain types of attacks like DNS spoofing and cache poisoning,
  which can redirect users to malicious sites. This is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and trust in DNS responses, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  regulatory compliance with frameworks that mandate secure DNS configurations.
description: This rule checks whether DNSSEC is enabled for all managed zones where
  it is supported. DNSSEC provides an additional layer of security by allowing DNS
  responses to be verified for authenticity and integrity. To verify, ensure that
  the DNSSEC configuration is set to 'on' in the Google Cloud Console for each applicable
  managed zone. If not enabled, navigate to 'Cloud DNS' in the Google Cloud Console,
  select the managed zone, and activate DNSSEC to enhance domain security.
