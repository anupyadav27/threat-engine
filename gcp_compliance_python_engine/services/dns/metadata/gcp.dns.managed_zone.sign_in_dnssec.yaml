title: Enable DNSSEC on DNS Managed Zones
rationale: Enabling DNSSEC for DNS managed zones ensures the authenticity and integrity
  of DNS data, protecting against attacks such as DNS spoofing and cache poisoning.
  This enhances trust in DNS responses, which is critical for preventing unauthorized
  redirections that could lead to data breaches or service disruptions. Compliance
  with regulatory frameworks like NIST and PCI-DSS often mandates the use of DNSSEC
  for secure DNS operations.
description: This rule checks if DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are enabled on Google
  Cloud DNS managed zones. DNSSEC provides cryptographic assurance for DNS data, preventing
  tampering and ensuring that responses are from the authentic source. To verify,
  navigate to the Cloud DNS section in the GCP Console, select the managed zone, and
  ensure DNSSEC status is set to 'On'. To enable, click 'Edit' on the managed zone
  and toggle DNSSEC to 'On'.
