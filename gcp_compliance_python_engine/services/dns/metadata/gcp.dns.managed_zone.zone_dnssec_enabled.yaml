title: Ensure DNSSEC is Enabled for DNS Managed Zones
rationale: Enabling DNSSEC on managed zones helps protect against DNS spoofing and
  cache poisoning attacks by providing origin authentication of DNS data. This enhances
  the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses, reducing the risk of malicious
  redirection and data exfiltration. Compliance with security standards like NIST
  and PCI-DSS often requires DNSSEC for secure DNS operations.
description: This rule checks whether DNSSEC is enabled on Google Cloud DNS managed
  zones. DNSSEC provides a layer of security by digitally signing DNS records, ensuring
  their integrity and authenticity. To enable DNSSEC, access the Cloud DNS service
  in the GCP Console and configure the managed zone settings to enable DNSSEC. Verifying
  DNSSEC status can be done via the GCP Console or the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation
  involves enabling DNSSEC and ensuring the proper setup of DS (Delegation Signer)
  records in your domain registrar.
