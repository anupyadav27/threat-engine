title: Restrict DNS Traffic to Approved Domains Only
rationale: Restricting DNS traffic to approved domains minimizes exposure to malicious
  sites, reducing the risk of data breaches and phishing attacks. This control is
  critical for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, and is often required
  by compliance standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if DNS policies are configured to allow traffic only
  to domains explicitly approved by the organization. To verify, review the DNS policy
  settings in the Google Cloud Console to ensure that only specified domains are allowed.
  Remediate by updating the DNS policy to include only trusted domain names and regularly
  review and update this list to adapt to changing business needs.
