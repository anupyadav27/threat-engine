title: Avoid Wildcard Permissions in Kubernetes ClusterRoles
rationale: Wildcard permissions in Kubernetes ClusterRoles can lead to unauthorized
  access to cluster resources, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and data
  breaches. By restricting permissions to only those necessary for specific tasks,
  organizations mitigate potential attack vectors and adhere to the principle of least
  privilege, aligning with compliance mandates such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for the presence of wildcard ('*') permissions in Kubernetes
  ClusterRoles within GCP. Wildcard permissions can grant excessive access, allowing
  actions beyond intended use. To verify, inspect ClusterRole configurations in your
  GCP Kubernetes Engine and ensure permissions are explicitly defined. Remediation
  involves updating ClusterRoles to specify exact resources and actions required for
  each role, avoiding the use of '*'.
