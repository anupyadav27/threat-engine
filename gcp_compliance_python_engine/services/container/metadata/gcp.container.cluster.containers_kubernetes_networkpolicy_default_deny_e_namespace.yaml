title: Enforce Default Deny Network Policies in Kubernetes Namespaces
rationale: Implementing a default deny network policy is crucial for minimizing the
  attack surface in Kubernetes environments. It helps prevent unauthorized access
  and lateral movement by ensuring that only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted.
  This approach is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, particularly
  in multi-tenant or sensitive environments, and aligns with compliance frameworks
  that require strict network segmentation.
description: This check ensures that a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is configured with
  a default deny rule for ingress and egress traffic in each namespace. By default,
  Kubernetes allows all traffic, which could lead to potential security breaches.
  To verify, review the NetworkPolicy resources in each namespace and ensure a policy
  exists that denies all traffic unless explicitly allowed. Remediation involves creating
  or updating NetworkPolicy resources to include a default deny rule, thus enforcing
  strict traffic controls.
