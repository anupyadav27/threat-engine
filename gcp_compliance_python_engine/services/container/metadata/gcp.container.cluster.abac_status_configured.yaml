title: Ensure ABAC is Disabled for GKE Clusters
rationale: Enabling ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) on GKE clusters can lead
  to security vulnerabilities as it allows overly permissive access to Kubernetes
  resources. Disabling ABAC and using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) helps in minimizing
  access permissions, aligning with the principle of least privilege, and meeting
  compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and SOC2 by reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access.
description: This rule checks if ABAC is disabled for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  clusters. By default, GKE uses RBAC, which is more secure and manageable. To verify,
  navigate to the GKE cluster settings in the Google Cloud Console and ensure that
  ABAC is turned off. Remediation involves disabling ABAC and configuring RBAC policies
  to control access to Kubernetes resources effectively.
