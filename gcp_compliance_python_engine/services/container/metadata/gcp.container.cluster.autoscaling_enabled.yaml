title: Ensure Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaling is Enabled
rationale: Enabling autoscaling for Kubernetes clusters ensures that resources are
  efficiently managed, automatically adjusting to load demands. This prevents over-provisioning
  and reduces costs while maintaining application performance. It also mitigates potential
  denial-of-service scenarios by ensuring sufficient resources during traffic surges,
  aligning with best practices for operational resilience and compliance with scalability
  requirements.
description: This rule checks if autoscaling is enabled on GCP Kubernetes clusters.
  Autoscaling adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster based on workload and resource
  utilization metrics. To verify, ensure the `autoscaling` configuration is set in
  the cluster's node pool settings. Remediation involves enabling autoscaling by configuring
  the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the Google Cloud Console or via the `gcloud`
  command-line tool for existing clusters.
