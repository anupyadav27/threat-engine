title: Ensure Kubernetes Network Policies are Configured in Namespaces
rationale: Kubernetes Network Policies are essential for defining the allowed traffic
  between pods in a namespace and external endpoints. Without these policies, there
  is a risk of unauthorized access and data breaches due to unrestricted network communications.
  Implementing network policies helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 by enforcing strict access control and segmentation.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes Network Policies are present for
  every namespace in your GCP Kubernetes Engine clusters. Network Policies act as
  a security boundary, allowing administrators to specify which connections are permitted,
  thereby minimizing attack surfaces. To verify, ensure that each namespace has at
  least one network policy defined that specifies ingress and egress rules as per
  your security requirements. Remediation involves creating and applying a NetworkPolicy
  resource in each namespace using Kubernetes YAML configurations.
