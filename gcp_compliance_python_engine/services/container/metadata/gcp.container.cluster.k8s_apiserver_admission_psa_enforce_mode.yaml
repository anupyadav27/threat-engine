title: Enforce PSA Mode in K8s Apiserver Admission
rationale: Enforcing Pod Security Admission (PSA) modes helps mitigate risks associated
  with unauthorized or insecure workloads running in your Kubernetes clusters. Without
  enforcement, malicious or poorly configured pods could compromise cluster security,
  leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions. Compliance frameworks
  often require strict access controls, making PSA enforcement necessary for regulatory
  adherence.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes API server's admission controller
  is configured to enforce Pod Security Admission (PSA) modes. PSA modes control the
  security context of pods, ensuring they adhere to defined security policies. Administrators
  should verify that the 'PodSecurityPolicy' admission controller is enabled and properly
  configured. To remediate, update the API server configuration to enable PSA with
  enforce mode by setting the appropriate flags and policy definitions.
