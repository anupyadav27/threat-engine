title: Enable Kubernetes Disk Encryption for Node Pools
rationale: Enabling disk encryption for Kubernetes node pools ensures that sensitive
  data is protected at rest, mitigating unauthorized access risks in the event of
  a data breach. It addresses compliance requirements by safeguarding data according
  to regulatory standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate encryption for data
  protection.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes node pools in Google Kubernetes Engine
  (GKE) have disk encryption enabled. Disk encryption ensures that the data stored
  on the persistent disks of nodes is encrypted using encryption keys, providing an
  additional layer of security. To enable encryption, configure the node pool to use
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption keys (GMEK)
  through the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command line tool. Regularly review and
  update encryption settings to adhere to security policies.
