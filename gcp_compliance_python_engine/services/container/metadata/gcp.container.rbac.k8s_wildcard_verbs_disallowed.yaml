title: Disallow Wildcard Verbs in Kubernetes RBAC Policies
rationale: Allowing wildcard verbs such as '*' in Kubernetes RBAC policies can lead
  to over-permissioning, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  exploitation of the Kubernetes environment. This can result in data breaches, service
  disruptions, and non-compliance with security standards like NIST SP 800-53 and
  ISO 27001, which require least privilege access controls.
description: This rule checks for Kubernetes RBAC policies that use wildcard verbs,
  which allow unrestricted actions on resources. To secure your environment, replace
  wildcard verbs with specific actions such as 'get', 'list', or 'watch', based on
  the intended use case. Verify current policies through the GCP Console or CLI, and
  update any policies using wildcard verbs to ensure compliance with the principle
  of least privilege.
