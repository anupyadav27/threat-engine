title: Ensure Kubernetes Fargate Profiles Use Private Subnets
rationale: Using private subnets for Kubernetes Fargate profiles reduces the exposure
  of your container workloads to the internet, mitigating the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential attacks. This configuration supports compliance with data protection
  regulations by ensuring sensitive workloads remain within a controlled network environment,
  enhancing both security posture and operational integrity.
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes Fargate profiles within your GCP container
  clusters are configured to use only private subnets. To ensure compliance, review
  the network settings of your Fargate profiles and configure them to operate exclusively
  within private subnets. This setup limits the exposure of your workloads to the
  public internet, thereby reducing attack vectors. Remediation involves editing the
  cluster's networking settings to ensure Fargate profiles are associated with private
  subnets, which can be done through the GCP Console or using gcloud commands.
