title: Ensure Kubernetes Containers Run Without Privileged Mode
rationale: Running containers in privileged mode grants them elevated access to the
  host system, which can lead to potential security breaches if compromised. This
  poses risks such as unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and compliance
  violations with standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strict control over
  system privileges.
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes containers in GCP's node pools are not
  running in privileged mode. Privileged containers have extensive permissions, potentially
  allowing them to escape the container environment and access the host system. To
  verify, inspect your Kubernetes pod specifications for the 'privileged' flag and
  ensure it is set to 'false'. Remediation involves updating your Kubernetes configurations
  to remove any privileged settings from your container specifications.
