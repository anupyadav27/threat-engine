title: Restrict Container Cluster Admin Role Assignment
rationale: The Cluster Admin role grants extensive permissions that can lead to unauthorized
  access or modification of cluster configurations, posing significant security risks.
  Limiting this role's assignment mitigates the potential for privilege escalation,
  reduces the attack surface, and aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001, enhancing overall security posture.
description: This rule checks for the assignment of the 'roles/container.clusterAdmin'
  role to users and service accounts. To secure the environment, ensure this role
  is assigned only to trusted personnel by reviewing IAM policies and using Google
  Cloud IAM Conditions for more granular control. Remediation involves auditing current
  assignments and implementing least privilege principles by minimizing the number
  of users with this role.
