title: Enable Integrity Monitoring on GKE Node Pools
rationale: Enabling integrity monitoring on GKE node pools helps detect unauthorized
  changes to the operating system and kernel. This is crucial for maintaining the
  security of containerized applications, as it can prevent potential breaches that
  may lead to data loss or service disruption. Furthermore, it supports compliance
  with industry standards demanding regular system integrity checks.
description: This rule checks if integrity monitoring is enabled for Google Kubernetes
  Engine (GKE) node pools. Integrity monitoring ensures that any unexpected changes
  to the node's kernel or system packages are detected. To verify, ensure that the
  'enable-integrity-monitoring' flag is set when creating or updating a node pool.
  Remediation involves using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to enable integrity monitoring
  on existing node pools, enhancing the overall security posture by protecting against
  unauthorized modifications.
