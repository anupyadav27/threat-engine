title: Ensure Network Policy is Enabled for GKE Clusters
rationale: Enabling network policy in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is crucial for
  controlling traffic flow between pods, reducing the risk of lateral movement in
  the event of a breach. This enhances the security posture by allowing restrictions
  based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols, which is essential for compliance with
  security standards and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks that network policy support is configured for GKE clusters,
  ensuring that network policies can be applied to control traffic. To verify, check
  if the network policy is enabled in your GKE cluster settings. Remediation involves
  enabling network policy by configuring the cluster with the `--enable-network-policy`
  flag during creation or updating existing clusters via GCP Console or `gcloud` CLI.
  This helps in isolating workloads and enforcing security controls efficiently.
