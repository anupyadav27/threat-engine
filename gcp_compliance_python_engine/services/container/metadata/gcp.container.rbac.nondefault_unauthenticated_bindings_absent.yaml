title: Ensure No Unauthenticated RBAC Bindings in Kubernetes Clusters
rationale: Allowing unauthenticated access to Kubernetes clusters can lead to unauthorized
  users exploiting services, accessing sensitive data, or causing service disruptions.
  This poses significant security risks and could result in financial loss, reputational
  damage, and compliance violations with standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This check ensures that Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations
  in GCP do not have unauthenticated bindings outside of default settings. Verify
  that no roles are bound to unauthenticated users by reviewing the RBAC policies
  in your GKE clusters. Remediation involves auditing and removing any nondefault
  bindings to the unauthenticated group, ensuring only authenticated and authorized
  users have access.
