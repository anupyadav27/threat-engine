title: Enable Secure Port for Kubernetes Controller Manager
rationale: Enabling the secure port for the Kubernetes Controller Manager is crucial
  for ensuring that communication with the API server is encrypted and authenticated.
  This security measure mitigates risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized
  access, which can compromise cluster operations and sensitive data. Aligning with
  security standards like CIS GCP Benchmarks also helps meet regulatory compliance
  requirements.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes Controller Manager is configured to
  use a secure port for communication. To verify, ensure that the `--secure-port`
  flag is set to a non-zero value in the Controller Manager's configuration. Remediation
  involves updating the cluster configuration to specify a secure port, typically
  10257, in accordance with best practices. This action helps secure the control plane's
  communication channels.
