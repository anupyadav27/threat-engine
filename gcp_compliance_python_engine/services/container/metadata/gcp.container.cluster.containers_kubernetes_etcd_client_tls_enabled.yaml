title: Ensure Kubernetes Etcd Client TLS is Enabled on Clusters
rationale: Enabling TLS for Kubernetes etcd client communications is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from interception and unauthorized access. Without TLS, data transmitted
  between clients and etcd, which often includes configuration details and secrets,
  could be exposed to attackers. This is vital for maintaining data integrity and
  confidentiality, thus supporting compliance with security standards such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if TLS is enforced for client communications with the
  etcd service in Kubernetes clusters. Ensure that the etcd server is configured to
  use TLS encryption for client communications by specifying the '--client-cert-auth'
  and providing appropriate certificates. This can be verified by examining the etcd
  configuration files or through the Kubernetes API server settings. Remediate any
  configurations not using TLS by updating the etcd settings and redeploying the cluster
  with secured configurations.
