requirement: Containers Kubernetes Kubelet Authz Webhook Or RBAC Enabled
scope: container.node_pool.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Kubelet Authorization Webhook or RBAC is Enabled
rationale: Enabling Kubelet Authorization Webhook or RBAC is crucial for enforcing
  fine-grained access control on Kubernetes nodes. Without these mechanisms, unauthorized
  users or processes may gain access to sensitive workloads, leading to potential
  data breaches or system compromise. This configuration helps meet compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 by ensuring proper access controls are in place.
description: This rule checks that the Kubelet on GKE node pools has either the authorization
  webhook or RBAC enabled, which are critical for controlling access to the Kubernetes
  API. To verify, inspect the Kubelet configuration for 'authorization-mode' set to
  'Webhook' or 'RBAC'. If neither is enabled, configure your GKE cluster to use RBAC
  by default or set up a webhook authorization. This ensures only authenticated and
  authorized requests are processed by the Kubernetes nodes.
