title: Enable Kubernetes Controller Manager Service in GKE
rationale: Enabling the Kubernetes Controller Manager service in Google Kubernetes
  Engine (GKE) is crucial for maintaining control over the cluster's state and ensuring
  that the desired configurations are implemented. Without this service, automated
  management of node and pod lifecycle processes could be disrupted, leading to potential
  security vulnerabilities and downtime. Compliance with security standards like CIS
  benchmarks often requires such services to be enabled to ensure proper cluster management
  and monitoring.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes Controller Manager service is
  enabled in your GKE cluster. The Controller Manager is responsible for managing
  controllers that regulate node and pod lifecycle actions. To verify, access your
  GKE cluster settings and ensure that the Controller Manager is active. Remediation
  involves enabling the service through the GCP Console or using the `gcloud` CLI
  to update the cluster configuration, ensuring continuous management of cluster operations.
