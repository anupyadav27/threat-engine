title: Ensure Use of Google Managed SSL Certificates in GKE Clusters
rationale: Using Google Managed SSL Certificates in GKE clusters ensures that your
  Kubernetes workloads are protected with certificates that are automatically managed
  and renewed by Google Cloud. This minimizes the risk of expired certificates leading
  to insecure communication and potential data breaches, which can have significant
  business and legal repercussions, especially in industries governed by data protection
  regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are configured
  to use Google Managed SSL Certificates for securing communication. By default, GKE
  offers the option to use managed certificates, which are automatically maintained
  and renewed, reducing manual overhead and the risk of human error. To verify compliance,
  ensure that Google Managed SSL Certificates are enabled and properly configured
  in your GKE clusters. If not compliant, configure your GKE Ingress to use managed
  certificates by setting up the appropriate `ManagedCertificate` resource and associating
  it with your Ingress.
