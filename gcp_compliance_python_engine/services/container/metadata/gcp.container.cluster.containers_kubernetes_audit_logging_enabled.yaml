title: Enable Kubernetes Audit Logging for GKE Clusters
rationale: Enabling Kubernetes audit logging is crucial for tracking important events
  and changes within your GKE clusters. It helps in identifying unauthorized access
  attempts, policy violations, and potential security threats, thus supporting compliance
  with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Without audit logs, detecting
  and investigating security incidents becomes significantly more challenging, increasing
  the risk of undetected breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes audit logging is enabled for Google
  Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Audit logging should be configured to capture
  all API requests and responses, which can be achieved by setting the 'enableKubernetesAuditLogging'
  field to true in the cluster's logging configuration. To verify, use the Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool to ensure that audit logging is activated.
  Remediation involves updating the cluster's logging settings to include Kubernetes
  audit logs.
