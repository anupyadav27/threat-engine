title: Avoid Using 'latest' Tag for Kubernetes Container Images
rationale: Using the 'latest' tag for container images can lead to unpredictable deployments,
  as it may pull different versions over time. This increases the risk of introducing
  vulnerabilities and reduces the ability to audit or roll back changes effectively.
  It can also lead to non-compliance with standards requiring controlled software
  deployment processes.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes workloads are configured with container
  image tags set to 'latest'. Instead, specify a specific version tag to ensure consistent
  and predictable deployments. Verify by reviewing Kubernetes manifests or deployment
  configurations for image tags. To remediate, update the container image tag in your
  Kubernetes configuration to a specific version number and redeploy the workload.
