title: Disable Kubernetes Kubelet Read-Only Port on GCP Node Pools
rationale: Enabling the read-only port on Kubernetes Kubelet exposes the node's metrics
  and status information to unauthenticated users, which can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential exploitation of the node. This misconfiguration can be leveraged
  by attackers to conduct reconnaissance, leading to more serious attacks such as
  privilege escalation or denial of service. Disabling this port is crucial for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of the cluster's operational data and is often
  required to meet compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks if the read-only port for Kubernetes Kubelet is disabled
  on all node pools within a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. By default, the
  read-only port is set to 10255, which can be accessed without authentication. To
  enhance security, it should be set to '0' to disable it. This can be verified and
  configured by checking the node pool's Kubelet settings in the GCP Console or using
  the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves updating the node configuration
  to ensure the read-only port is disabled, thus reducing potential attack vectors.
