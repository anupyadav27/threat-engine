title: Deny Privilege Escalation in Kubernetes Admission
rationale: Preventing privilege escalation in Kubernetes containers is crucial to
  maintain the security boundaries of your applications. If a container can escalate
  its privileges, it could potentially gain access to sensitive data or control over
  other resources, leading to data breaches or service disruptions. This practice
  is important for meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which
  mandate strict access controls.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes admission controllers deny privilege escalation
  in GKE clusters. It ensures that containers cannot gain additional privileges beyond
  their initial configuration, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. To verify,
  check that the PodSecurityPolicy or equivalent configurations are set to prevent
  privilege escalation. Remediation involves updating your Kubernetes admission policies
  to deny any containers attempting to request escalated privileges.
