title: Enforce Image Registry Admission Control in Kubernetes Clusters
rationale: Enforcing image registry admission policies in Kubernetes clusters is crucial
  for ensuring that only trusted container images are deployed. This reduces the risk
  of introducing vulnerabilities from unverified sources, thereby protecting sensitive
  data and maintaining service integrity. Additionally, it helps in meeting compliance
  requirements related to software supply chain security.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes clusters enforce admission controls
  to allow only images from approved registries. It involves setting up admission
  controllers or policies within the cluster to verify image sources during the deployment
  process. To implement, configure the Kubernetes admission controller to whitelist
  trusted registries and continuously monitor for policy compliance. This can be verified
  by reviewing the cluster's admission controller settings and ensuring they are configured
  correctly.
