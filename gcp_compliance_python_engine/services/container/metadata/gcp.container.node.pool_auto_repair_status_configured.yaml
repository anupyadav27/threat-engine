title: Ensure Kubernetes Node Pool Auto-Repair is Enabled
rationale: Enabling auto-repair for Kubernetes node pools ensures that any unhealthy
  nodes are automatically repaired, reducing downtime and maintaining application
  availability. This feature helps mitigate risks associated with node failures, which
  can lead to service disruptions and potential data loss, impacting business continuity
  and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether auto-repair is enabled for all node pools in
  a GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster. Auto-repair automatically fixes unhealthy nodes,
  which can occur due to hardware or software issues. To verify, navigate to the GCP
  Console, go to Kubernetes Engine, select your cluster, and check the settings for
  each node pool to ensure 'Auto-repair' is enabled. If not configured, enable it
  to ensure nodes are self-healing and minimize manual intervention.
