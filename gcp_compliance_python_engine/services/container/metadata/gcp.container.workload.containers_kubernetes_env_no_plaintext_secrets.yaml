title: Prevent Plaintext Secrets in Kubernetes Container Environments
rationale: Storing secrets in plaintext within Kubernetes environments poses significant
  security risks, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. This practice violates
  compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which require robust data protection
  measures. Ensuring secrets are encrypted protects against insider threats and external
  attacks, maintaining trust and compliance.
description: This rule checks for the presence of plaintext secrets in environment
  variables in Kubernetes containers. Organizations should use Kubernetes Secrets
  to manage sensitive information securely. Remediation involves auditing container
  configurations, replacing plaintext secrets with references to encrypted Kubernetes
  Secrets, and ensuring all deployments adhere to this standard. Regular audits and
  automated checks can help maintain compliance.
