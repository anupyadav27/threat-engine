title: Ensure Kubernetes Runs From GCP Trusted Channels
rationale: Running Kubernetes from trusted channels ensures that clusters receive
  timely security patches and updates, minimizing the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities.
  This practice is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of containerized
  applications and aligns with regulatory requirements for maintaining secure infrastructure.
description: This rule checks if GKE clusters are configured to use Kubernetes versions
  from GCP's trusted release channels, such as Rapid, Regular, or Stable. Configuring
  clusters to follow these channels ensures automatic updates and patches. To verify,
  inspect the GKE cluster settings in the Google Cloud Console or via gcloud CLI to
  confirm the channel configuration. Remediate by updating cluster settings to align
  with a trusted release channel.
