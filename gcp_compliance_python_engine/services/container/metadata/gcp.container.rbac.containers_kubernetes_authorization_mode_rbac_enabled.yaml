title: Ensure Kubernetes RBAC Authorization Mode is Enabled
rationale: Enabling RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes is crucial for
  managing permissions and access to resources within your cluster. Without RBAC,
  there is a risk of unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
  resource modifications, and potential downtime. This configuration supports compliance
  with frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001, which emphasize the importance of access
  control.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes cluster is configured with RBAC enabled,
  which is essential for granular access management. To verify, inspect the Kubernetes
  API server startup parameters to ensure '--authorization-mode' includes 'RBAC'.
  Remediation involves updating the cluster configuration to include 'RBAC' in the
  authorization mode settings, ensuring that roles and role bindings are properly
  defined to control access.
