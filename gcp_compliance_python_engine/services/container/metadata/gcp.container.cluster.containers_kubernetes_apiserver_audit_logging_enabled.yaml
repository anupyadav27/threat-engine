title: Enable Kubernetes API Server Audit Logging
rationale: Enabling Kubernetes API server audit logging is crucial for tracking access
  and activity within your GKE clusters, which can help identify potential security
  breaches and unauthorized access attempts. This measure supports compliance with
  industry standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA by ensuring that detailed logs are available
  for auditing and incident investigation. It also helps in maintaining the integrity
  and security of applications running on GKE.
description: This check verifies that audit logging is enabled for the Kubernetes
  API server in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Audit logs provide a record
  of actions taken within your cluster, including access to the Kubernetes API. To
  enable audit logging, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select Kubernetes Engine,
  and configure the cluster's logging settings to include audit logs. Ensure that
  logs are stored securely and monitored regularly for suspicious activity.
