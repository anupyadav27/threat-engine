title: Enable K8s Etcd Client Certificate Authentication
rationale: Enabling client certificate authentication for etcd in Kubernetes clusters
  enhances security by ensuring that only authenticated clients can access the etcd
  server. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration,
  supporting compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which
  mandate robust access controls to sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether client certificate authentication is enabled
  for etcd in Kubernetes clusters. Etcd is a critical component in Kubernetes, storing
  all cluster data, and securing it with client certificates ensures that only verified
  entities can communicate with it. To verify, check the cluster's etcd configuration
  for the '--client-cert-auth' flag. Remediation involves updating your etcd configuration
  to include client certificate authentication, thus enhancing the security posture
  of the cluster.
