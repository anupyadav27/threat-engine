title: Enable Seccomp Profile Runtime Default for GKE Pods
rationale: Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) provides a way to filter system calls that
  a container can make, enhancing security by reducing the attack surface. Enforcing
  the Runtime Default profile helps prevent privilege escalation and protects against
  kernel vulnerabilities. This mitigation is critical for meeting compliance with
  standards like NIST SP 800-190 and PCI-DSS that emphasize container isolation and
  protection.
description: 'This rule checks that GKE pods are configured to use the Seccomp Runtime
  Default profile, which restricts system calls to a defined set. To verify, ensure
  the pod''s securityContext includes ''seccompProfile'' set to ''type: RuntimeDefault''.
  If not configured, update your Kubernetes pod specifications to include this setting.
  This can be done by editing the YAML file of the pod or deployment and redeploying
  it. Enabling this profile provides a baseline level of security against container
  escape vulnerabilities.'
