title: Disable Client Certificate Authentication on GKE Clusters
rationale: Disabling client certificate authentication in Google Kubernetes Engine
  (GKE) is critical to mitigating risks associated with certificate-based attacks,
  including man-in-the-middle and unauthorized access. By relying on alternative authentication
  methods like IAM, organizations reduce complexity and adhere to security best practices,
  aligning with compliance frameworks such as NIST SP 800-53 and PCI-DSS 3.2.1.
description: This rule checks if client certificate authentication is disabled for
  GKE clusters, a setting that prevents unauthorized access via compromised client
  certificates. To verify, inspect the cluster's authentication settings and ensure
  the 'clientCertificateConfig.issueClientCertificate' is set to 'false'. Remediation
  involves modifying the cluster configuration through the GCP Console or using 'gcloud'
  CLI to update the cluster settings, ensuring stronger security posture by leveraging
  IAM-based authentication.
