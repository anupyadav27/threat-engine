title: Ensure Kubernetes RBAC Subjects Are Namespace Scoped
rationale: Limiting RBAC subjects to specific namespaces minimizes the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access to resources across the cluster. This practice
  helps organizations comply with the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack
  surface and potential impact of malicious activities. It also aligns with compliance
  requirements to enforce strict access controls.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes RBAC subjects are restricted to specific
  namespaces rather than having cluster-wide permissions. To verify, review the RBAC
  RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings to ensure roles are assigned within namespaces.
  Remediation involves auditing existing bindings and adjusting them to use namespace-specific
  roles and bindings. This ensures that users and services have access only to the
  necessary resources within their designated namespaces.
