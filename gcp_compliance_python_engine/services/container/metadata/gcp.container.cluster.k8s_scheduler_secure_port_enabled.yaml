title: Enable Secure Port on Kubernetes Scheduler
rationale: Enabling the secure port for the Kubernetes scheduler is crucial to ensure
  encrypted communications between the scheduler and other cluster components. This
  mitigates the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized data interception,
  enhancing compliance with security standards like NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001 that
  emphasize secure communication protocols.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes scheduler in a GCP container
  cluster is configured to use a secure port for communications. The secure port should
  be enabled to ensure all communications are encrypted using TLS. Verify this setting
  by checking the scheduler's configuration file or parameters. Remediation involves
  configuring the scheduler to use the secure port, typically 10259, by updating the
  cluster's API server settings.
