title: Enable Kubernetes Shielded Secure Boot for Node Pools
rationale: Enabling Shielded Secure Boot on Kubernetes node pools reduces the risk
  of firmware attacks by ensuring that the system boots with only trusted software.
  This enhances the security posture by protecting against unauthorized changes to
  the boot environment, a critical defense in maintaining data integrity and compliance
  with standards like PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: 'This rule checks if Shielded Secure Boot is enabled on node pools within
  GCP Kubernetes Engine. Shielded Secure Boot ensures that each boot component is
  cryptographically verified, safeguarding against tampered boot firmware. To verify,
  ensure that the node pool configuration includes ''shieldedInstanceConfig: { enableSecureBoot:
  true }''. Remediation involves updating your node pool configurations through GCP
  Console or CLI to enable Shielded Secure Boot.'
