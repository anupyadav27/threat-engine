title: Monitor DNS and Metrics Access in GKE Clusters
rationale: Monitoring DNS and metrics access in GKE clusters is essential to detect
  unusual behavior, prevent data exfiltration, and maintain visibility into cluster
  operations. Unauthorized access can lead to sensitive data exposure and compromise
  cluster integrity, impacting business continuity and compliance with standards such
  as ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow monitoring and logging
  of DNS requests and metrics access in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Ensure
  that only authorized sources can access Kubernetes services to maintain a secure
  and observable environment. Configure Network Policies and enable logging to track
  access to sensitive endpoints. Remediate by reviewing access controls and ensuring
  that all access is logged and monitored.
