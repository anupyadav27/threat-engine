title: Ensure Network Policies Are Defined for Kubernetes Namespaces
rationale: Defining network policies within Kubernetes namespaces is crucial to controlling
  traffic flow between pods and services. Without explicit network policies, namespaces
  are vulnerable to unrestricted communication, increasing the risk of lateral movement
  by attackers within the cluster. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access,
  and potential regulatory non-compliance, impacting business operations and reputation.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes namespaces in GCP have associated network
  policies to manage ingress and egress traffic. Network policies allow you to specify
  how groups of pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
  To verify, ensure that a policy exists for each namespace, specifying allowed traffic
  sources and destinations. Remediation involves creating and applying network policies
  using Kubernetes manifests or via the GCP Console, tailored to your security requirements.
