title: Enable Secure Port for Kubernetes Controller Manager
rationale: Enabling the secure port for the Kubernetes Controller Manager helps protect
  sensitive communication within the Kubernetes control plane. It mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access and data interception, which are crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of cluster operations. This configuration supports
  compliance with security standards that mandate encryption of sensitive data in
  transit.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes Controller Manager in your GCP cluster
  is configured to use a secure port for communication. By default, the secure port
  (443) should be enabled to ensure that all data exchanged between components is
  encrypted. To verify, check the `--secure-port` flag in the Controller Manager's
  configuration. If not set to 443, update the configuration to enable this secure
  port, ensuring that the control plane communications are encrypted.
