title: Enable Kubernetes Scheduler Leader Election
rationale: Enabling leader election for the Kubernetes scheduler ensures high availability
  and fault tolerance by allowing multiple schedulers to be deployed with only one
  acting as the leader at any time. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure
  in cluster management, which can impact application availability and lead to compliance
  violations with standards requiring fault-tolerant architecture.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes scheduler in a GCP container cluster
  is configured with leader election enabled. Leader election allows a backup scheduler
  to take over seamlessly if the current leader fails, ensuring continuous cluster
  operations. To verify, ensure that the scheduler manifest includes the '--leader-elect=true'
  flag. Remediation involves updating the scheduler configuration to enable this flag
  if it is not set.
