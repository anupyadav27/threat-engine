title: Ensure Authorization Policies on GKE Node Pools
rationale: Implementing authorization policies on GKE node pools reduces unauthorized
  access risks, protects sensitive workloads, and ensures compliance with security
  standards. Unauthorized access to node pools can lead to data breaches and service
  disruptions, negatively impacting business operations and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) node pools have
  proper authorization policies in place to control access and permissions. It checks
  for configurations that ensure only authorized identities can access and manage
  workloads. To verify compliance, review and configure IAM policies on node pools
  to limit access to essential users. Remediation involves setting up role-based access
  controls (RBAC) and using IAM policies to enforce the principle of least privilege.
