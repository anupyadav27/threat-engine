subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: high
title: Ensure Kubernetes ETCD Encryption at Rest is Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Kubernetes ETCD data is critical to protect
  sensitive cluster metadata and secrets from unauthorized access. Unencrypted ETCD
  data can lead to serious security breaches, exposing configurations, secret keys,
  and user information. Compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often
  requires encryption of sensitive data, ensuring protection against data theft and
  unauthorized disclosures.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes ETCD data is encrypted at rest within
  the GCP container cluster. Enabling this feature ensures that all ETCD data is stored
  in an encrypted format, safeguarding against data exposure in the event of a breach.
  To verify and remediate, navigate to the GCP Console, select Kubernetes Engine,
  choose the desired cluster, and ensure that 'Enable Kubernetes secrets encryption'
  is enabled under the Security settings. Follow the GCP documentation for detailed
  steps on configuring ETCD encryption.
