title: Enable TLS for Kubernetes Etcd Peer Communication
rationale: Enabling TLS for Etcd peer communication in a Kubernetes cluster is critical
  to protect sensitive data exchanged between nodes. Unsecured peer communication
  can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Compliance
  with security standards such as NIST and ISO 27001 often requires encryption of
  data in transit, making this a key aspect of regulatory adherence.
description: This rule checks if Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enabled for communication
  between Etcd peers in a Kubernetes cluster. TLS encrypts the data exchanged, preventing
  eavesdropping and unauthorized access. To verify, ensure the Etcd configuration
  in your Kubernetes setup specifies TLS-enabled endpoints. Remediate by configuring
  Etcd to use TLS certificates for peer communication, which can be done through the
  GCP Console or by updating the Kubernetes API server settings.
