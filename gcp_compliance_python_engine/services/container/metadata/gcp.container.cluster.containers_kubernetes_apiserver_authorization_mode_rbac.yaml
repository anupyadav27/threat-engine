title: Enable RBAC for Kubernetes API Server Authorization
rationale: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the Kubernetes API server
  is critical for minimizing unauthorized access and controlling who can perform specific
  actions within the cluster. This enhances the security posture by ensuring that
  permissions are granted based on the principle of least privilege, reducing the
  risk of privilege escalation and potential data breaches. It also aligns with compliance
  requirements for regulated industries.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes API server in your GCP container clusters
  is configured to use RBAC for authorization. RBAC allows for fine-grained access
  control by defining roles and binding them to users or service accounts. To verify,
  ensure that the 'authorization-mode' parameter includes 'RBAC' in the API server
  configuration. Remediation involves updating your cluster's API server settings
  to include 'RBAC' in the authorization modes, which can be done via the GCP console
  or command line interface.
