title: Ensure VPC Native Alias IP is Enabled for GKE Clusters
rationale: Enabling VPC Native Alias IPs on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters
  allows for better network isolation, scalability, and IP address management. This
  configuration reduces the risk of IP exhaustion and ensures that pods have access
  to all VPC network services securely. It is essential for meeting compliance requirements
  related to network segmentation and access control, thereby minimizing the risk
  of unauthorized access to resources.
description: This rule checks if GKE clusters are using VPC Native Alias IPs, which
  allow each pod to receive a unique IP address from a range assigned to the cluster.
  To verify, ensure that the cluster configuration includes 'ipAllocationPolicy' with
  'useIpAliases' set to true. Remediation involves updating the cluster settings to
  enable 'VPC Native' alias IPs, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console or
  gcloud CLI, enhancing the network security posture.
