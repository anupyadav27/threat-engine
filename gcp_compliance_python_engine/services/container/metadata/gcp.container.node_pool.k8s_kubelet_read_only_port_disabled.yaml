title: Disable K8s Kubelet Read Only Port in Node Pools
rationale: Disabling the Kubelet read-only port prevents unauthorized access to sensitive
  metrics and data, reducing the risk of information disclosure and potential exploitation
  by attackers. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of cluster operations and is aligned with best practices for securing Kubernetes
  environments.
description: This rule checks whether the read-only port for the Kubelet is disabled
  on all nodes within a GCP Kubernetes Engine node pool. The Kubelet's read-only port,
  when enabled, can expose sensitive endpoint information without authentication,
  making it a target for attackers. Ensure the '--read-only-port=0' flag is set in
  the Kubelet configuration on each node. Remediation involves updating the node pool
  configuration to disable the read-only port and applying the changes to the cluster
  nodes.
