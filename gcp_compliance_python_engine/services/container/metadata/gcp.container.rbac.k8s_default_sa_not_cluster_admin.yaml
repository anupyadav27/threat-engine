requirement: K8s Default Sa Not Cluster Admin
scope: container.rbac.security
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: critical
title: Prevent Default K8s Service Account from Cluster Admin Role
rationale: Allowing the default Kubernetes service account to have cluster-admin role
  grants it excessive permissions, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and
  unauthorized access. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized resource manipulations,
  and compliance violations with frameworks like NIST and PCI-DSS, thus compromising
  organizational security posture.
description: This rule checks if the default Kubernetes service account is assigned
  the cluster-admin role within GCP Kubernetes Engine clusters. To mitigate security
  risks, ensure that the default service account does not have cluster-admin privileges
  by adjusting role bindings through GCP IAM. Review current role assignments and
  modify them as necessary to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
