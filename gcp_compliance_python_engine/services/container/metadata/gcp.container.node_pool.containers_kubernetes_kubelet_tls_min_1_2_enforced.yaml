title: Enforce Kubelet TLS Min Version 1.2 in GKE Node Pools
rationale: Ensuring that the Kubelet uses a minimum TLS version of 1.2 helps protect
  data in transit from being intercepted or altered by unauthorized parties. This
  setting mitigates risks associated with weak encryption protocols and is critical
  for maintaining compliance with industry standards such as PCI-DSS and SOC 2, which
  mandate strong encryption practices.
description: This rule checks if Kubelet in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) node pools
  enforces a minimum TLS version of 1.2. The TLS settings for Kubelet should be configured
  to reject connections that do not support at least version 1.2. To verify, inspect
  the kubelet configuration on each node and ensure the `--tls-min-version` flag is
  set to `1.2` or higher. Remediate by updating the cluster configuration to enforce
  the required TLS version, which may involve adjusting the node pool settings or
  upgrading the GKE version if necessary.
