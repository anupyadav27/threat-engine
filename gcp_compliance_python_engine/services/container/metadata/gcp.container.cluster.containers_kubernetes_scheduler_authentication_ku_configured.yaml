title: Ensure Kubernetes Scheduler Authentication Configured
rationale: Configuring authentication for the Kubernetes scheduler in GCP ensures
  that only authorized users and services can interact with the scheduling component
  of your container orchestration. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access,
  which could lead to workload disruptions, resource misallocation, or unauthorized
  data exposure, impacting business operations and compliance with regulations such
  as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes scheduler in a GCP container cluster
  has authentication mechanisms properly configured. It involves verifying settings
  that enforce identity verification for scheduler API interactions. Remediation includes
  enabling authentication in the Kubernetes API server configuration, ensuring all
  communications use secure credentials and adhere to least privilege principles.
  This can be verified by checking the GCP Console or using gcloud CLI commands to
  review and update cluster settings.
