title: Ensure System Masters Group is Absent from GKE Clusters
rationale: The presence of the system masters group in GKE clusters poses a security
  risk by granting overly broad permissions that may lead to unauthorized access and
  privilege escalation. Removing this group mitigates the risk of insider threats
  and aligns with the principle of least privilege, which is critical for maintaining
  a secure and compliant Kubernetes environment.
description: This rule checks for the absence of the system masters group in Google
  Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. To verify, inspect cluster role bindings and ensure
  that the system:masters group is not bound to any roles. Remediation involves modifying
  or removing any existing role bindings that include this group, thereby preventing
  excessive permissions. This configuration enhances security by limiting access to
  only necessary personnel and services.
