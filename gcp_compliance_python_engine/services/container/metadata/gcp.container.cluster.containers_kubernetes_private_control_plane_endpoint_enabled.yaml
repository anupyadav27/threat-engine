title: Enable Private Endpoint for Kubernetes Control Plane
rationale: Enabling a private endpoint for the Kubernetes control plane minimizes
  exposure to the internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  attacks on the cluster's management interfaces. This configuration aligns with the
  principle of least privilege by restricting access to the control plane to only
  those resources and users within the specified private network, thus enhancing the
  overall security posture and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes control plane endpoint is configured
  to use a private IP address accessible only within the VPC network. To verify, ensure
  that the cluster's private endpoint is enabled in the Google Cloud Console under
  Kubernetes Engine settings, or via the gcloud command-line tool by setting the 'privateEndpoint'
  attribute. Remediation involves updating the cluster configuration to enable private
  endpoint access, which can be done during cluster creation or by updating an existing
  cluster.
