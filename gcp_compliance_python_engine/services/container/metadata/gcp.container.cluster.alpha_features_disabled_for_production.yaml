title: Disable Alpha Features in Production GKE Clusters
rationale: Alpha features in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) are experimental and may
  not be stable or secure enough for production environments. Allowing these features
  increases the risk of potential vulnerabilities, instability, and non-compliance
  with certain security standards, which could lead to unauthorized access or data
  breaches.
description: This rule checks if any GKE cluster in the environment is using alpha
  features, which are not recommended for production use due to their experimental
  nature. To ensure a stable and secure production environment, disable alpha features
  in all production clusters. Verify by reviewing the cluster configurations and ensure
  that no alpha APIs are enabled. If alpha features are present, consider migrating
  to stable or beta features where possible.
