title: Enable Kubernetes API Server Audit Logging
rationale: Enabling Kubernetes API Server audit logging is crucial for tracking and
  analyzing requests made to the Kubernetes API. This capability helps detect unauthorized
  access and potential security breaches, while also supporting compliance with regulations
  that mandate detailed activity logging. It enhances visibility into operations,
  aiding in the forensic investigation of security incidents.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes API Server audit logging is enabled
  for GCP Kubernetes Engine clusters. Audit logging records all requests to the Kubernetes
  API server, providing a comprehensive trail of activity. To verify and enable this
  setting, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select Kubernetes Engine, choose
  the desired cluster, and ensure that 'Enable Kubernetes API Server audit logging'
  is checked under the logging section. This ensures that all interactions with the
  Kubernetes API are logged for security and compliance purposes.
