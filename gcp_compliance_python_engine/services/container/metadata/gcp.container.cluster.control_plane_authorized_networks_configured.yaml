title: Configure Control Plane Authorized Networks in GKE Clusters
rationale: Configuring Control Plane Authorized Networks in Google Kubernetes Engine
  (GKE) clusters is vital for restricting access to the Kubernetes API server, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This configuration
  enhances security by ensuring that only trusted IP addresses can interact with the
  control plane, aligning with regulatory requirements such as NIST SP 800-53 and
  ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that Control Plane Authorized Networks are configured
  for GKE clusters, which involves specifying IP ranges that are allowed to access
  the Kubernetes API server. Verification can be done by reviewing the cluster settings
  in the Google Cloud Console or using the `gcloud` command-line tool. To remediate,
  update the cluster's settings to include authorized networks, ensuring that all
  entries are well-managed and documented. This can be done by navigating to the GKE
  cluster's 'Networking' settings and adding the required IP ranges.
