rule_id: gcp.container.cluster.containers_kubernetes_scheduler_secure_port_tls_enabled
service: container
resource: cluster
requirement: Containers Kubernetes Scheduler Secure Port TLS Enabled
scope: container.cluster.security
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Ensure Kubernetes Scheduler Secure Port uses TLS
rationale: Enabling TLS for the Kubernetes Scheduler Secure Port ensures encrypted
  communication, mitigating risks of data interception and unauthorized access. This
  is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive cluster
  operations, supporting compliance with security standards like NIST and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes Scheduler Secure Port has TLS enabled.
  To verify, ensure the cluster configuration includes `--secure-port` and `--tls-cert-file`
  parameters set appropriately. Remediate by updating the scheduler configuration
  to include these parameters, ensuring communications are encrypted.
