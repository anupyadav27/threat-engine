title: Restrict Cluster Admin Role for Authenticated Users
rationale: Assigning the cluster admin role to all authenticated users can lead to
  unauthorized access and potential compromise of the entire Kubernetes cluster. This
  poses a significant security risk, allowing users to deploy malicious workloads
  or exfiltrate sensitive data. Limiting cluster admin privileges is crucial for maintaining
  a secure and compliant environment, ensuring adherence to best practices and regulatory
  standards such as NIST and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes cluster does not assign the cluster
  admin role to all authenticated users by reviewing RBAC configurations. Administrators
  should ensure that only specific, trusted identities are granted cluster admin privileges.
  To remediate, audit the existing role bindings and adjust permissions by creating
  specific roles with the least privilege principle in mind and assigning them to
  designated users or service accounts. Regularly monitor and update permissions to
  maintain a secure setup.
