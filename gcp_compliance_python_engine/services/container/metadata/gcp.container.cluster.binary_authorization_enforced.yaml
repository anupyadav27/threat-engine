title: Ensure Binary Authorization is Enforced on GKE Clusters
rationale: Binary Authorization in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) enhances security
  by ensuring only trusted container images are deployed. This mitigates the risk
  of deploying vulnerable or malicious images, protecting the integrity of the application.
  Enforcing Binary Authorization supports compliance with industry standards like
  PCI-DSS and SOC 2, which require strict control over software deployment processes.
description: This rule checks whether Binary Authorization is enforced on GKE clusters.
  To verify, ensure that the `binaryAuthorization` setting is enabled in the cluster
  configuration. Enforcing Binary Authorization requires configuring attestors to
  validate container images against defined policies. Remediation involves updating
  the cluster settings to enable Binary Authorization and configuring policies that
  align with your security requirements.
