title: Enable GKE Sandbox for Node Pools
rationale: Enabling GKE Sandbox provides an additional layer of security by isolating
  container workloads using gVisor, reducing the risk of container escape and potential
  damage to the host system. This is crucial for maintaining a secure Kubernetes environment,
  particularly for organizations processing sensitive or regulated data, and helps
  in mitigating risks associated with multi-tenancy.
description: This rule checks whether GKE Sandbox is enabled for Kubernetes node pools.
  GKE Sandbox uses gVisor to provide a secure isolation boundary between container
  workloads and the host operating system. To verify, ensure that node pools are configured
  with the 'sandbox.gke.io/runtime' node label. If not enabled, apply this label to
  enhance security by preventing kernel-level attacks. Consult the GCP console or
  use the gcloud command-line tool to update your node pool configurations.
