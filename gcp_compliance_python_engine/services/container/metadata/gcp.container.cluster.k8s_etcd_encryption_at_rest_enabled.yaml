title: Enable Kubernetes Etcd Encryption at Rest in GKE Clusters
rationale: Encrypting etcd data at rest in Kubernetes clusters is critical to protect
  sensitive configuration data, such as secrets and configuration maps. Without encryption,
  this data is vulnerable to unauthorized access in the event of a data breach or
  insider threat. Enabling encryption helps meet compliance requirements for data
  protection standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, reducing the risk of data exposure.
description: This rule checks if etcd, the key-value store used by Kubernetes for
  configuration data, is encrypted at rest in GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.
  To verify, ensure the encryptionConfig field is enabled in the cluster's configuration.
  Remediation involves configuring the cluster with a Customer Managed Encryption
  Key (CMEK) to enable etcd encryption, providing an additional layer of security
  for sensitive data stored in clusters.
