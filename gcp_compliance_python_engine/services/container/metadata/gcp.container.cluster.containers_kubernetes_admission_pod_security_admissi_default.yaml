title: Enable Kubernetes Pod Security Admission for Clusters
rationale: Enabling Kubernetes Pod Security Admission helps mitigate risks associated
  with unauthorized or unsafe pod configurations, reducing potential attack surfaces
  such as privilege escalation and resource exhaustion. It aligns with regulatory
  demands for secure container operations and aids in maintaining a compliant and
  secure Kubernetes environment, crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and business
  operations.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes Pod Security Admission is enabled in GCP
  Kubernetes clusters. Proper configuration helps enforce security policies at the
  pod level, preventing the deployment of pods that do not meet security requirements.
  To verify, ensure that the Pod Security Admission controller is set up in the GKE
  cluster configurations. Remediation involves configuring the PodSecurityPolicy in
  your Kubernetes Engine settings to restrict pod deployments based on specified security
  standards.
