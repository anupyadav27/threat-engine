title: Enforce Administrative Boundaries in Kubernetes Namespaces
rationale: Enforcing administrative boundaries in Kubernetes namespaces is critical
  to prevent unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within a GCP Kubernetes
  Engine cluster. This helps in maintaining clear separation of duties, ensuring that
  different teams or applications do not interfere with each other, which reduces
  the risk of accidental or malicious changes. Proper namespace isolation supports
  compliance with regulations requiring data segregation and access control, such
  as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes namespaces within a GCP Container service
  have enforced administrative boundaries using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
  It ensures namespaces are configured with specific roles and bindings to restrict
  user and service account permissions, preventing unauthorized access to resources.
  To verify, inspect the RBAC policies associated with each namespace and ensure they
  align with least privilege principles. Remediation involves reviewing and adjusting
  role bindings in the Kubernetes cluster to ensure proper isolation and control.
