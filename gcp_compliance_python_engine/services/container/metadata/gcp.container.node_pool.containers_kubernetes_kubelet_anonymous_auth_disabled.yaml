title: Ensure Kubernetes Kubelet Anonymous Auth is Disabled
rationale: Disabling anonymous authentication for Kubernetes Kubelet is critical to
  prevent unauthorized access to the kubelet API, which could lead to potential security
  breaches such as unauthorized data exposure or resource manipulation. This measure
  helps in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of cluster operations, aligning
  with compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and SOC2 that emphasize access control
  and data protection.
description: This rule checks that anonymous authentication is disabled on Kubernetes
  Kubelet nodes within a GCP container node pool. Anonymous auth allows requests to
  be made to the kubelet API without authentication, posing a security risk. To verify,
  ensure that the kubelet configuration does not include the `--anonymous-auth` flag
  set to true. Remediate by setting this flag to false in the node pool configuration
  to restrict kubelet API access to authenticated users only.
