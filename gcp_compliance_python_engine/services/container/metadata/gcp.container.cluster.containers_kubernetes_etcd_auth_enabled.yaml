title: Enable Kubernetes Etcd Authentication in GKE Clusters
rationale: Enabling authentication for etcd in Kubernetes clusters is crucial to protect
  sensitive data stored in etcd, including configuration information and secrets.
  Unauthorized access to etcd can result in data breaches, service disruptions, and
  compliance violations, particularly those related to data protection regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether authentication is enabled for etcd in Google
  Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Etcd serves as a key-value store for Kubernetes
  cluster data, and enabling authentication ensures that only authorized users and
  services can access it. To verify, ensure that the GKE cluster is configured with
  etcd authentication enabled. Remediation involves setting up secure communication
  channels and restricting access to etcd endpoints using IAM roles and policies.
