title: Avoid HostPath Mounts in Kubernetes Workloads
rationale: HostPath mounts can expose sensitive parts of the host filesystem to containers,
  increasing the risk of privilege escalation and data leakage. This may lead to unauthorized
  access, potential data breaches, and non-compliance with security standards such
  as NIST and PCI-DSS which mandate the protection of sensitive data and system integrity.
description: This rule checks Kubernetes workloads for the use of HostPath mounts,
  which should be avoided to prevent exposing the host's filesystem to containers.
  Verify workloads by scanning their configurations and removing any HostPath volumes.
  Instead, use persistent storage solutions like PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to
  safely manage storage. Remediation involves updating workload configurations to
  eliminate HostPath usage and implementing secure storage practices.
