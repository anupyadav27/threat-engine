title: Ensure K8s API Server Uses TLS v1.2 or Higher
rationale: Enforcing a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for Kubernetes API server communication
  helps protect against vulnerabilities associated with older versions of the protocol.
  This ensures a higher standard of data encryption and integrity, reducing the risk
  of data breaches and man-in-the-middle attacks. Compliance with regulations such
  as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often mandates the use of strong encryption protocols, which
  includes TLS 1.2 or higher.
description: This rule verifies that the Kubernetes API server within a Google Kubernetes
  Engine (GKE) cluster is configured to use TLS version 1.2 or higher. It is essential
  to configure the API server with the `--tls-min-version` flag set to '1.2' or higher
  to ensure secure communication. To check this setting, inspect the cluster's API
  server configuration. Remediation involves updating the cluster's API server settings
  via the GCP console or GCloud CLI to enforce the minimum TLS version requirement.
