title: Disable Kubernetes Dashboard in GKE Clusters
rationale: The Kubernetes Dashboard can expose sensitive cluster information and administrative
  capabilities if not secured properly, leading to potential unauthorized access and
  control over cluster resources. Disabling it mitigates risks of exploitation by
  attackers who may leverage vulnerabilities in the dashboard to compromise the cluster.
  This precaution aligns with compliance requirements to minimize attack surfaces
  and protect data integrity.
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes Dashboard is disabled in Google
  Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. The dashboard can be a vector for attacks if exposed
  to the internet without proper authentication and authorization. To verify, ensure
  that the Kubernetes Dashboard add-on is not installed on your GKE clusters. If installed,
  remove it using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI. Disabling the dashboard enhances
  security by reducing potential entry points for attackers.
