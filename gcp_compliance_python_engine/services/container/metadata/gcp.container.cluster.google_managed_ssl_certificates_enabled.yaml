title: Enable Google Managed SSL Certificates for GKE Clusters
rationale: Using Google Managed SSL Certificates ensures that SSL/TLS encryption is
  consistently applied to all traffic to your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters,
  reducing the risk of data interception and ensuring compliance with standards requiring
  encryption in transit. This approach also simplifies certificate management, reducing
  the risk of human error and expired certificates, which can lead to service disruption
  and potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks if Google Managed SSL Certificates are enabled for GKE
  clusters, ensuring that all ingress traffic is automatically secured with managed
  certificates. To verify, navigate to the GKE cluster settings in the Google Cloud
  Console and ensure that your ingress configurations utilize Google Managed SSL Certificates.
  Remediation involves configuring your ingress resources to use 'managedCertificate'
  with a 'spec.tls' field, thereby automating certificate provisioning and renewal.
