title: Prevent Cluster Admin Role Bindings to Individual Users
rationale: Assigning the cluster-admin role to individual users increases the risk
  of privilege abuse, leading to potential unauthorized access and control over Kubernetes
  clusters. This practice can result in non-compliance with frameworks like NIST and
  ISO 27001, as it violates the principle of least privilege and can expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized users.
description: This rule checks for any direct bindings of the cluster-admin role to
  individual users in Kubernetes clusters on GCP. Such bindings should be avoided
  to prevent excessive privilege allocation. Instead, users should be assigned specific
  roles that match their required permissions. Remediation involves reviewing the
  existing role bindings, identifying any users with the cluster-admin role, and modifying
  their permissions to adhere to least privilege principles.
