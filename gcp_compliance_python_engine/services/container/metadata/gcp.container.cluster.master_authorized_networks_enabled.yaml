title: Enable Master Authorized Networks for GKE Clusters
rationale: Enabling Master Authorized Networks in GKE clusters restricts access to
  the Kubernetes API server, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. This control
  helps prevent potential attacks such as credential stuffing or brute force attempts
  from unauthorized IP ranges, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and
  confidentiality of cluster workloads and data.
description: This rule checks if Master Authorized Networks are enabled for Google
  Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. When enabled, it allows access to the Kubernetes
  API server only from specific IP addresses, enhancing security by limiting potential
  attack vectors. To verify, navigate to the GKE cluster settings in the GCP Console
  and ensure that Master Authorized Networks are configured with the intended IP ranges.
  If not enabled, update the cluster settings to specify the authorized networks.
