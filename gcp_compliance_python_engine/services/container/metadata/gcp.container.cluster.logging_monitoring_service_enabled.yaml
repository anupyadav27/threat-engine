title: Ensure GKE Cluster Logging and Monitoring is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging and monitoring for GKE clusters is crucial for detecting
  unauthorized access attempts, diagnosing operational issues, and maintaining audit
  trails. Without this, organizations may face increased risks of undetected security
  breaches and non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and SOC2, which require
  robust logging and monitoring mechanisms.
description: This rule checks if Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters have both
  logging and monitoring services enabled. These services should be configured to
  collect system and application logs and metrics. To verify, inspect the cluster
  settings in the GCP Console or use gcloud CLI to ensure that 'loggingService' and
  'monitoringService' are not set to 'none'. Remediation involves enabling these services
  through the GCP Console or using gcloud commands to update the cluster.
