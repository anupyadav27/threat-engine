title: Ensure GKE Node Pool Auto-Upgrades Are Enabled
rationale: Enabling auto-upgrades for GKE node pools ensures that nodes receive the
  latest security patches and feature updates, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities
  being exploited. This is critical for maintaining a secure Kubernetes environment
  and aligning with compliance requirements that mandate up-to-date software. Failure
  to do so could lead to increased exposure to known vulnerabilities and potential
  breaches.
description: This check verifies that the auto-upgrade feature is enabled for all
  Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) node pools. Auto-upgrades help automatically keep
  the nodes updated with the latest Kubernetes versions, which include critical security
  patches and improvements. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select
  Kubernetes Engine, then select Clusters, and review each node pool's settings to
  ensure auto-upgrade is enabled. Remediation involves updating the node pool settings
  to enable auto-upgrades through the console or using the gcloud command line tool.
