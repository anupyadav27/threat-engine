title: Ensure Node Pool Service Account Uses Least Privilege
rationale: Configuring node pools with the principle of least privilege minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Overprivileged
  service accounts can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized resource access, and
  compliance violations with frameworks such as NIST and PCI-DSS. This configuration
  is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment.
description: This rule checks if the service account used by GCP Kubernetes Engine
  node pools is configured with only the necessary permissions. Verify that the service
  account associated with the node pool has roles that are strictly required for its
  operations. Remediate by assigning only specific roles essential for the node's
  functions and avoid using default or overly permissive service accounts. Regularly
  audit service account permissions to ensure adherence to the principle of least
  privilege.
