title: Enable Kubernetes Admission Image Signature Verification
rationale: Enabling image signature verification in GCP Kubernetes clusters mitigates
  risks of deploying untrusted or malicious container images, which can lead to data
  breaches, service disruptions, and compliance violations. It ensures only signed
  and trusted images are deployed, aligning with security best practices and regulatory
  frameworks.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes clusters in GCP have image signature verification
  enabled, which is crucial for ensuring that only verified images are allowed to
  run. To verify, ensure that the policy controller is configured with the appropriate
  admission webhook to enforce signature checks. Remediation involves configuring
  the Binary Authorization to enforce image signature policies, thereby preventing
  unauthorized images from being deployed.
