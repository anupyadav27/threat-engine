title: Prevent RBAC Privilege Escalation in Kubernetes Clusters
rationale: Improperly configured RBAC permissions can lead to privilege escalation,
  allowing unauthorized users to gain elevated access within Kubernetes clusters.
  This poses a significant security risk, potentially leading to data breaches, service
  disruptions, and non-compliance with standards such as NIST and PCI-DSS. Ensuring
  least privilege access is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of
  containerized applications.
description: This rule checks for Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions
  that could enable privilege escalation within GCP container clusters. It identifies
  roles with broad 'bind' or 'impersonate' permissions that could be exploited. To
  remediate, review and restrict these permissions, ensuring they adhere to the principle
  of least privilege. Use the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to audit and adjust
  IAM roles accordingly.
