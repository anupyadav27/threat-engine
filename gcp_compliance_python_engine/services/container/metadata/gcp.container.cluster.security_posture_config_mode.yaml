title: Enable Security Posture Config Mode in GKE Clusters
rationale: Configuring Security Posture Config Mode in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  clusters helps enterprises maintain a robust security posture by automatically enforcing
  security policies and monitoring for compliance. This reduces the risk of misconfigurations
  that could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches, and ensures alignment with
  regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if the GKE cluster has Security Posture Config Mode
  enabled, which is crucial for proactive security management. To verify, navigate
  to the Google Cloud Console, select Kubernetes Engine, and check if the Security
  Posture Config Mode is set. To enable, update your GKE cluster settings to include
  security policy configurations. This helps maintain compliance and enhances the
  security monitoring of your container workloads.
