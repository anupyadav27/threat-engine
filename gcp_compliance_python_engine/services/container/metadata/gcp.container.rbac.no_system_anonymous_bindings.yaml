title: Prevent System Anonymous Role Bindings in GKE Clusters
rationale: Allowing system anonymous bindings in Kubernetes Engine can expose your
  cluster to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
  This practice can violate compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and SOC2, where
  strict access controls are mandated. Unauthorized users could exploit this access
  to perform malicious actions, compromising the integrity and availability of your
  workloads.
description: This rule checks for the presence of role bindings in Google Kubernetes
  Engine (GKE) that grant permissions to the 'system:anonymous' user. To verify, review
  the RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings in your GKE clusters for any roles assigned
  to 'system:anonymous'. To remediate, remove or replace these bindings with specific
  user or group bindings that adhere to the principle of least privilege. This ensures
  only authenticated and authorized users have access to sensitive operations within
  your clusters.
