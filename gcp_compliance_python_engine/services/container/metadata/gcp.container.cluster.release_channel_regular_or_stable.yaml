title: Ensure GKE Clusters Use Regular or Stable Release Channels
rationale: Using Regular or Stable release channels for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  clusters reduces the risk of deploying untested or unstable software, minimizing
  the potential for security vulnerabilities and operational disruptions. This approach
  aligns with best practices for maintaining a secure and reliable Kubernetes environment,
  ensuring that clusters receive timely security patches and updates. Compliance with
  security frameworks often mandates using stable software versions to mitigate risks
  associated with experimental features.
description: This rule checks if GKE clusters are configured to use either the Regular
  or Stable release channels, which are known for their balance of feature updates
  and stability. Regular release channels offer a compromise between receiving new
  features and maintaining stability, while Stable channels focus on delivering well-tested,
  reliable updates. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, go to Kubernetes
  Engine, and check the Release Channel setting for each cluster. If necessary, change
  the channel by editing the cluster settings to ensure compliance with security best
  practices.
