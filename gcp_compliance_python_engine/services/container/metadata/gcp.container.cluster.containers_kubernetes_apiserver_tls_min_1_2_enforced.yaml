title: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for Kubernetes API Server in GKE
rationale: Enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher for the Kubernetes API server in GKE protects
  data-in-transit from interception and tampering, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the
  communication between clients and the API server, aligning with industry standards
  and regulatory requirements, such as PCI-DSS and NIST SP 800-52 for secure communications.
description: This rule checks if the Kubernetes API server in a GKE cluster is configured
  to enforce a minimum of TLS 1.2 for secure communications. To verify, ensure the
  API server configuration in your GKE cluster specifies TLS 1.2 as the minimum version.
  Remediation involves updating the GKE cluster's API server settings to reject connections
  below TLS 1.2, which can be done via the `gcloud` command-line tool or the GCP Console
  by setting the appropriate security policies.
