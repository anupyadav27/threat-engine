title: Enable Logging for GKE Autopilot Clusters
rationale: Enabling logging for GKE Autopilot clusters ensures that all container
  activities are recorded, allowing for thorough monitoring and auditing. This visibility
  helps identify and respond to potential security incidents, compliance violations,
  and operational issues quickly. Without logging, detecting unauthorized access or
  misconfigurations becomes significantly more challenging, increasing the risk of
  data breaches and non-compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for GKE Autopilot clusters, ensuring
  that all container activities are recorded. To verify, confirm that Cloud Operations
  is configured to capture logs for all workloads running in the cluster. If logging
  is not enabled, enable it in the cluster settings through the Google Cloud Console
  or via the gcloud CLI by setting the `enable-stackdriver-kubernetes` flag. This
  configuration is crucial for maintaining visibility into the cluster's operations
  and security posture.
