title: Ensure Kubernetes Scheduler RBAC is Properly Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of Kubernetes Scheduler Authorization is crucial for
  preventing unauthorized access to cluster resources. Misconfigured RBAC can lead
  to privilege escalation, allowing attackers to execute malicious workloads, potentially
  leading to data breaches or service disruptions. Ensuring correct permissions align
  with compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, minimizing business and legal
  risks.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes Scheduler RBAC policies are properly
  configured within GCP Kubernetes Engine clusters. Specifically, it verifies that
  the scheduler has the least privilege necessary to perform its functions. To verify,
  inspect the RBAC role bindings and ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.
  Remediation involves reviewing and updating the RBAC settings to restrict permissions
  to only what is necessary for the scheduler's operation.
