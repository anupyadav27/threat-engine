title: Ensure Kubelet Anonymous Authentication is Disabled
rationale: Disabling anonymous authentication for kubelet nodes reduces the risk of
  unauthorized access to Kubernetes nodes, which can prevent data breaches and unauthorized
  data manipulation. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of workloads and aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001
  that mandate secure access controls.
description: This rule checks whether anonymous authentication is disabled for kubelets
  in your GCP Kubernetes Engine node pools. Anonymous authentication allows access
  to the kubelet API without authentication, which can be exploited by attackers.
  To verify, review node pool configurations and ensure the `--anonymous-auth` flag
  is set to `false`. Remediate by updating the node pool configurations to disable
  anonymous authentication.
