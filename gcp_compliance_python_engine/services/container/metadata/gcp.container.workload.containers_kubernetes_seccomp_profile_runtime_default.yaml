title: Enforce Seccomp Profile Runtime Default in Kubernetes Containers
rationale: Using the default seccomp profile in Kubernetes containers enhances security
  by minimizing the attack surface and mitigating potential exploitation of kernel
  vulnerabilities. It protects against unauthorized system calls that could lead to
  privilege escalation or container escape, thereby safeguarding sensitive workloads
  and maintaining compliance with security standards.
description: 'This rule checks if Kubernetes containers in GCP workloads are using
  the seccomp profile set to ''RuntimeDefault'', which restricts system call capabilities
  to a safe subset. To verify, ensure that your pod specifications include ''securityContext.seccompProfile.type:
  RuntimeDefault''. If not configured, update your Kubernetes deployment manifests
  to include this setting. This practice helps in adhering to least privilege principles
  and enhances container security posture.'
