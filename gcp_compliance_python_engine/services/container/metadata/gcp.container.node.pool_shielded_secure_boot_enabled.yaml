title: Ensure Shielded VM Secure Boot is Enabled for Node Pools
rationale: Enabling Shielded VM Secure Boot for Kubernetes node pools protects against
  persistent, low-level malware threats and rootkits. This security feature ensures
  the integrity of the boot process, providing a trusted path for system startup,
  which is essential for maintaining the overall security posture of your containerized
  applications and meeting compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS and NIST.
description: This rule checks if Shielded VM Secure Boot is enabled for all node pools
  in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Secure Boot is a critical feature that helps
  prevent unauthorized software and rootkits from executing during the boot process.
  To verify, ensure that the Shielded VM options, specifically Secure Boot, are enabled
  in the node pool configuration. Remediation involves updating existing node pools
  or creating new node pools with Shielded VM Secure Boot enabled.
