title: Pin and Support Kubernetes Versions for Container Addons
rationale: Pinning and supporting specific Kubernetes versions reduces the risk of
  vulnerabilities by ensuring that clusters run on versions that are actively maintained
  and patched. Unpinned or unsupported versions may expose clusters to security flaws,
  impacting business operations and leading to potential data breaches. This practice
  also helps in meeting compliance requirements by aligning with standards that mandate
  regular updates and patches.
description: This rule verifies that Kubernetes versions for GCP container addons
  are pinned and supported. It checks if the clusters are running on a specific, supported
  version to ensure they receive security updates. Administrators should configure
  their GKE clusters to use supported Kubernetes versions by selecting a specific
  version and regularly updating to newer supported versions. This can be done via
  the GCP Console or gcloud CLI. Remediation involves reviewing the current version,
  comparing it against the supported list, and upgrading as necessary.
