subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Ensure Kubernetes Pods Use Restricted Security Context
rationale: Implementing restricted pod security contexts in Kubernetes namespaces
  minimizes security risks by preventing privilege escalation and reducing attack
  surfaces. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and workloads from unauthorized
  access, which can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance
  with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes pods within a namespace are configured
  with a restricted security context, which includes setting runAsNonRoot, disallowing
  privileged mode, and restricting capabilities. To verify compliance, review the
  PodSecurityPolicy or Pod Security Standards in place. Remediation involves applying
  or updating a PodSecurityPolicy to enforce these restrictions and ensuring developers
  adhere to these policies when deploying applications.
