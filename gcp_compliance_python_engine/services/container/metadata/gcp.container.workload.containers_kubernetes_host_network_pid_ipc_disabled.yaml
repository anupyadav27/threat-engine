title: Disable Host Network, PID, and IPC in Kubernetes Workloads
rationale: Allowing containers to use the host's network, PID, or IPC namespaces can
  expose sensitive host information and resources to potentially malicious workloads.
  This increases the attack surface and the risk of container escape, compromising
  the entire node. Adhering to this practice supports compliance with security frameworks
  such as NIST and ensures isolation between containerized applications.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes workloads are configured to use their
  own network, PID, and IPC namespaces, rather than sharing the host's. To verify,
  inspect the Pod specifications to ensure 'hostNetwork', 'hostPID', and 'hostIPC'
  are set to 'false'. Remediation involves updating the Pod definitions to disable
  host namespace sharing, enhancing workload isolation and security.
