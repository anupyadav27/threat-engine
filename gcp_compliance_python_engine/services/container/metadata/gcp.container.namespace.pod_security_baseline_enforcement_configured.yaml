title: Configure Pod Security Baseline Enforcement in Namespaces
rationale: Pod Security Baseline Enforcement is crucial for minimizing security risks
  within Kubernetes clusters by ensuring pods adhere to defined security standards.
  Without enforcement, pods may run with excessive permissions, exposing the cluster
  to privilege escalation attacks and non-compliance with security frameworks like
  NIST and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks whether Pod Security Baseline Enforcement is configured
  for all namespaces in GCP Kubernetes clusters. To verify, ensure that PodSecurityPolicy
  objects are defined and associated with namespaces to control the security context
  of pods. Remediation involves creating or updating PodSecurityPolicy resources to
  align with baseline security requirements and binding them to the necessary namespaces
  via RoleBindings.
