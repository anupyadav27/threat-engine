title: Ensure Kubernetes Containers Use Read-Only Filesystems
rationale: Enforcing read-only filesystems in Kubernetes containers reduces the risk
  of unauthorized modifications and mitigates the impact of potential security vulnerabilities.
  This approach minimizes the attack surface, making it harder for attackers to exploit
  writable filesystems to escalate privileges or execute malicious code. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with security frameworks that emphasize data integrity and
  protection.
description: This rule checks if Kubernetes containers within a node pool have their
  filesystems set to read-only. A read-only filesystem ensures that application code
  and libraries cannot be tampered with at runtime, enhancing container security.
  To verify this, inspect the container spec and ensure the 'securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem'
  field is set to true. Remediation involves updating the container specifications
  in your deployment configurations to enforce this setting.
