title: Ensure Kubernetes Containers Have Read-Only Root Filesystem
rationale: Enforcing a read-only root filesystem for Kubernetes containers minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized changes to the container's filesystem, which can prevent
  persistent malware and limit the impact of attacks. This control is crucial for
  maintaining the integrity of applications running in containers and aligns with
  compliance frameworks that emphasize system integrity and data protection.
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes containers in your GCP environment are
  configured with a read-only root filesystem. A read-only root filesystem helps mitigate
  the risk of filesystem tampering by attackers, thus reducing the attack surface.
  To verify compliance, ensure that the 'readOnlyRootFilesystem' attribute is set
  to 'true' in the container's security context. Remediation involves updating your
  Kubernetes deployment configuration to enforce this setting across all applicable
  containers.
