title: Enable CMEK for GKE Node Pool Boot Disks
rationale: Using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for GKE node pool boot disks
  enhances data security by providing greater control over encryption keys. This mitigates
  risks of unauthorized data access and supports compliance with regulations requiring
  customer-controlled encryption, such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if GKE node pool boot disks are encrypted using CMEK.
  By default, GCP uses Google-managed keys, but enabling CMEK allows you to manage
  key lifecycle and access. To verify, inspect the node pool configuration for the
  'diskEncryptionKmsKey' property. To enable CMEK, update the node pool with a specified
  KMS key using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI.
