title: Disable Kubernetes Scheduler Profiling in GCP Clusters
rationale: Disabling Kubernetes Scheduler profiling reduces exposure to potential
  unauthorized access and information disclosure risks. Profiling data can be exploited
  by attackers to gain insights into cluster performance and behavior, potentially
  leading to targeted attacks. Ensuring profiling is disabled aligns with security
  best practices and helps maintain compliance with regulatory frameworks requiring
  minimal exposure of sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether Kubernetes Scheduler profiling is disabled in
  GCP clusters. Profiling should be turned off to prevent unnecessary exposure of
  internal data that could aid an attacker. To verify, examine the cluster configuration
  to ensure the '--profiling' flag is set to 'false' for the kube-scheduler. Remediation
  involves updating the cluster configuration to disable profiling and redeploying
  the scheduler component if needed.
