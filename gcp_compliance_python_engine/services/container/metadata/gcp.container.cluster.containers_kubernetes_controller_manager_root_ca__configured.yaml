title: Ensure Kubernetes Controller Manager Root CA is Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of the Kubernetes Controller Manager Root CA is crucial
  to maintaining the security integrity of GKE clusters. Failing to configure this
  can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches, as the root CA is a critical component
  in the authentication and encryption infrastructure. Compliance with standards like
  PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 often requires robust certificate management practices.
description: This rule checks that the Kubernetes Controller Manager in GCP's GKE
  clusters has been configured with a valid Root CA, which is essential for secure
  communication and authentication within the cluster. Verify this setting by inspecting
  the Controller Manager's configuration for a properly defined root CA file. Remediation
  involves updating the Controller Manager settings to include a valid root CA file
  path, ensuring all certificates are correctly signed and trusted by the cluster.
