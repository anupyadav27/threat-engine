severity: high
title: Restrict Execution of Kubernetes Fargate Profiles with Ro Privilege
rationale: Allowing read-only (Ro) privilege in Kubernetes Fargate profiles can lead
  to unauthorized access to container data, increasing the risk of data exfiltration
  and privilege escalation. This misconfiguration can impact compliance with data
  protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, and can result in significant business
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks for Kubernetes Fargate profiles configured with read-only
  (Ro) execution privileges within Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Ensuring that Fargate
  profiles do not have unnecessary privileges minimizes the attack surface and adheres
  to the principle of least privilege. To remediate, review the IAM roles associated
  with Fargate profiles and adjust permissions to the minimum required for functionality.
  Verify that service accounts used by Fargate profiles are limited to necessary operations
  only.
