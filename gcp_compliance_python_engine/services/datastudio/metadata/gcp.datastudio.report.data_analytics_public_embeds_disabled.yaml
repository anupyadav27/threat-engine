severity: critical
title: Disable Public Embeds for Data Studio Reports
rationale: Public embeds of Data Studio reports can expose sensitive analytics data
  to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Disabling public embeds mitigates
  the risk of data exfiltration and helps ensure that only authorized personnel can
  access critical business insights.
description: This rule verifies that public embeds are disabled for Data Studio reports
  to prevent unauthorized access. Administrators should ensure that the 'Public Embed'
  option is turned off in the sharing settings of each report. Remediation involves
  reviewing Data Studio report permissions and settings, and configuring the reports
  to restrict access to authenticated users only.
