title: Ensure Single Sign-On for Data Studio Reports
rationale: Requiring Single Sign-On (SSO) for accessing Data Studio reports enhances
  security by centralizing authentication and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  It helps prevent data breaches by leveraging strong authentication mechanisms, and
  it simplifies user management, contributing to compliance with data protection regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This check ensures that Single Sign-On (SSO) is enforced for accessing
  Google Data Studio reports. To verify, administrators should ensure that the Data
  Studio is integrated with an identity provider (IdP) supporting SSO, and all users
  are required to authenticate via this system. Remediation involves configuring the
  IdP settings in the GCP Console to enforce SSO across Data Studio. Ensure that the
  identity provider is securely set up with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for
  added security.
