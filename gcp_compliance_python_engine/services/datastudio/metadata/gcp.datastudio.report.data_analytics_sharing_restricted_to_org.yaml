title: Restrict Data Studio Report Sharing to Organization
rationale: Limiting Data Studio report sharing to within the organization minimizes
  the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access. Exposing analytics data to external
  entities without proper controls could lead to business intelligence compromises
  and regulatory non-compliance, particularly concerning data privacy laws like GDPR
  and CCPA.
description: This rule checks that Data Studio reports are only shared with users
  within the organization, preventing external sharing. Verify the sharing settings
  by accessing the Data Studio report permissions and ensure no external email addresses
  are granted access. To remediate, adjust the sharing settings to 'Anyone within
  your organization' and remove any external sharing permissions.
