title: Enable Data Analytics Export Controls in Data Studio Reports
rationale: Ensuring that Data Analytics Export Controls are enabled in Data Studio
  reports helps prevent unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data. This
  is crucial for maintaining data privacy and complying with industry regulations
  such as GDPR and CCPA, which require strict controls over data handling and export.
  Failure to do so could lead to data breaches, reputational damage, and significant
  financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether the Data Analytics Export Controls are enabled
  in Google Data Studio reports. These controls restrict the ability to export data,
  helping to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.
  To verify, review the settings in each Data Studio report and enable export controls
  under the report settings. Remediation involves configuring these settings to limit
  data export capabilities to authorized personnel only.
