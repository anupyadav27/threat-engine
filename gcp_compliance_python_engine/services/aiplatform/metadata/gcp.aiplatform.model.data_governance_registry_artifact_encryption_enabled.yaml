title: Ensure Encryption of AI Platform Model Artifacts
rationale: Enabling encryption for AI Platform model artifacts protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is critical for
  maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially when dealing with proprietary
  algorithms and datasets. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA
  mandates robust data protection measures to safeguard user data and intellectual
  property.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for artifacts stored in
  the AI Platform's Data Governance Registry. It verifies that the 'encryptionSpec'
  field is configured with a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK). To ensure compliance,
  navigate to the AI Platform model settings in the Google Cloud Console and configure
  the 'encryptionSpec' using a CMEK. This enhances data security by allowing users
  to control the encryption keys used for their data.
