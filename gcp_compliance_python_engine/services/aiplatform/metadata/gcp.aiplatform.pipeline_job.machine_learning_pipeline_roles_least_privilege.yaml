title: Ensure Least Privilege for ML Pipeline Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for machine learning pipeline roles minimizes
  the attack surface by ensuring that users and service accounts have only the necessary
  permissions to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized data access,
  accidental data loss, and potential exploitation by malicious actors. Adhering to
  this principle helps in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and ISO 27001.
description: This rule audits the permissions associated with roles used in AI Platform
  pipeline jobs, ensuring they adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks
  for excessive permissions that are not required for the pipeline's functionality,
  such as permissions allowing access to unrelated resources. Remediation involves
  reviewing the roles assigned to users and service accounts and tailoring them to
  include only the necessary permissions. This can be done using the Google Cloud
  Console or gcloud CLI to update IAM policies.
