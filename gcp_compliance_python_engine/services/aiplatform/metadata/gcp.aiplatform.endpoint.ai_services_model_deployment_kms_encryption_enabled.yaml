service: aiplatform
resource: endpoint
requirement: Ai Services Model Deployment KMS Encryption Enabled
scope: aiplatform.endpoint.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure KMS Encryption for AI Model Deployments in Endpoints
rationale: Encrypting AI model deployments using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
  (CMEK) mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and aligns with regulatory
  requirements for data protection. It ensures sensitive model data is protected against
  potential breaches, especially in industries with strict data privacy laws like
  healthcare and finance.
description: This rule checks if AI model deployments in AI Platform Endpoints use
  CMEK for encryption at rest. To verify, ensure that the endpoint configuration specifies
  a valid KMS key. Remediation involves updating the endpoint settings to include
  a KMS key, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line
  tool. This ensures that the model data is encrypted with a key managed by your organization,
  enhancing control over data access.
