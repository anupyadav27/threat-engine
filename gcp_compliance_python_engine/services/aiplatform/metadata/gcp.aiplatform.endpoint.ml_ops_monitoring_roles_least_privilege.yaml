title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Endpoint Monitoring Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Platform endpoint monitoring roles
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It ensures
  that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, which
  is crucial for maintaining compliance with security standards like GDPR and HIPAA,
  as well as reducing the attack surface.
description: This rule checks that roles associated with AI Platform endpoint monitoring
  are configured to follow the principle of least privilege. It involves reviewing
  IAM policies to ensure that only essential permissions are granted. Remediation
  involves auditing and modifying IAM roles and policies to remove excessive permissions.
  Verification can be done by examining IAM role bindings and comparing them with
  operational requirements.
