title: Enable Logs for AI Platform Batch Prediction Job
rationale: Enabling logs for AI Platform batch prediction jobs is crucial for maintaining
  data governance and ensuring the traceability of data transformations. This is essential
  for understanding how data is processed, which aids in identifying potential security
  incidents and supporting compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Without
  these logs, organizations risk undetected data breaches and non-compliance with
  legal requirements.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for AI Platform batch prediction
  jobs. Logging should be configured to capture details about data transformations
  within AI jobs, aiding in auditing and forensic analysis. To verify, ensure that
  the logging configuration in AI Platform includes all necessary events. Remediation
  involves setting the 'logConfig' parameter in the batch prediction job configuration
  to enable logging.
