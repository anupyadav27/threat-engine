title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Model Registry Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Model Registry access minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches, intellectual property
  theft, and compliance violations. Limiting access strictly to necessary roles reduces
  the attack surface and aligns with regulatory requirements for data protection and
  privacy, such as GDPR and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule verifies that AI Model Registry access in Google Cloud Platform
  is configured according to the principle of least privilege. It checks that only
  specific roles with necessary permissions are granted access to the model registry,
  preventing over-privileged identities from making unauthorized modifications. Remediation
  involves auditing current access roles, revoking unnecessary permissions, and ensuring
  that roles like 'Viewer' or 'Editor' are only assigned to users with a clear business
  need.
