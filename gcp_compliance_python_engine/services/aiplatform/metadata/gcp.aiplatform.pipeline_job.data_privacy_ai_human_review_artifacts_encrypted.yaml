scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Human Review Artifacts Are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting human review artifacts in AI Platform ensures that sensitive
  data used in machine learning processes is protected from unauthorized access. This
  mitigates the risk of data breaches and aligns with compliance requirements such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personally identifiable information
  (PII) and sensitive data. Insufficient encryption can lead to significant financial
  and reputational damage due to data exposure.
description: This rule verifies that all human review artifacts generated by AI Platform
  Pipeline Jobs are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).
  To ensure compliance, configure the AI Platform to use CMEK for encryption by specifying
  the key in the pipeline job configuration. Regularly audit your encryption settings
  to ensure they align with your organization's data protection policies. Remediation
  involves updating the pipeline job configurations to specify a valid CMEK.
