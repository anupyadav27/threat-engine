title: Ensure AI Platform AutoML Logging is Enabled for Training Pipelines
rationale: Enabling Ai Automl logs for training pipelines is crucial for maintaining
  data privacy and security. Without logging, it is difficult to track data access
  and modifications, which increases the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential
  compliance violations. Logging also aids in forensic investigations and monitoring
  for suspicious activities, which are vital for achieving compliance with standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for AutoML training pipelines
  in Google Cloud's AI Platform. To ensure data privacy, logs should be configured
  to capture access and modification events for all training data processed by AutoML.
  Administrators can verify this by checking the logging configuration in the AI Platform
  settings. If logging is not enabled, it should be configured through the Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud CLI by setting the appropriate log sinks to capture the
  required events.
