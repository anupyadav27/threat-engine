title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Platform Training Pipelines
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform training pipelines mitigates
  the risk of data exposure by restricting access to sensitive data over the public
  internet. This ensures that training data remains protected from unauthorized access
  and potential interception, aligning with data privacy regulations and reducing
  the risk of data breaches. It supports compliance with frameworks like GDPR and
  HIPAA that mandate stringent data protection measures.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform training pipelines are configured to
  use private networking, which involves setting up VPC Peering or Private Google
  Access. To verify, ensure the training pipeline's execution environment is within
  a VPC network and that no public IP addresses are assigned. Remediation involves
  configuring private services access and updating the pipeline to operate within
  the secure network settings. This enhances security by isolating traffic within
  a controlled network perimeter.
