title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform endpoints reduces exposure
  to the public internet, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This improves data confidentiality and integrity, supports compliance with regulatory
  frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, and aligns with best practices for secure machine
  learning operations.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints are configured to use private
  IPs, ensuring they are accessible only through private networking within a Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC). To verify, inspect the endpoint's network configuration for
  private IP addresses. Remediation involves configuring the endpoint to use private
  networking through the GCP Console or gcloud CLI, ensuring it is part of a peered
  VPC network.
