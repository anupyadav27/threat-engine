requirement: Ai Services Feature Store Online Store KMS Encryptio Enabled
scope: aiplatform.featurestore.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure KMS Encryption Enabled for Feature Store Online Store
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI Feature Store Online Store protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity, especially when handling personally identifiable
  information (PII) or proprietary machine learning features. Compliance with standards
  like GDPR or CCPA may require encryption to safeguard user data and prevent legal
  penalties.
description: This rule checks if Key Management Service (KMS) encryption is enabled
  for the AI Platform Feature Store Online Store. Without KMS encryption, data at
  rest may be vulnerable to unauthorized access. To verify, ensure that the Feature
  Store's online store is configured to use a KMS key. Remediation involves setting
  up a KMS key in Google Cloud and configuring the Feature Store to utilize this key
  for encryption, providing an additional layer of security over default encryption.
