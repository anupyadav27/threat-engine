title: Ensure Data Privacy Logging is Enabled for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling data privacy logging for AI Platform endpoints helps ensure that
  access to sensitive data is monitored and recorded, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. This capability supports compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA by providing an audit trail of data access and
  usage, which is essential for maintaining trust and transparency with clients and
  stakeholders.
description: This rule checks that data privacy logging is enabled for AI Platform
  endpoints, which involves configuring logging settings to capture detailed access
  logs. To verify, ensure that Cloud Audit Logs are set up to include DATA_READ and
  DATA_WRITE activities for AI Platform endpoints. If not configured, enable logging
  via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI by setting the appropriate IAM roles
  and permissions. This action helps maintain a comprehensive audit log of data access
  for security and compliance purposes.
