title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Training Pipeline Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege in AI Platform training pipelines minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations, reducing the potential
  for data breaches and service disruptions. This approach aligns with compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict data access controls to
  protect personal data. Additionally, by limiting permissions, organizations can
  prevent privilege escalation attacks and maintain the integrity of their AI models.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to AI Platform training pipelines
  follow the principle of least privilege. It verifies that service account permissions
  are restricted to only those necessary for executing specific tasks within the training
  pipeline. To remediate, review and adjust IAM roles, removing unnecessary permissions
  and ensuring only essential access is granted. This can be verified through the
  IAM policy analysis tools available in the GCP Console, focusing on roles such as
  'roles/aiplatform.user' and 'roles/aiplatform.viewer' as opposed to broader roles
  like 'owner' or 'editor'.
