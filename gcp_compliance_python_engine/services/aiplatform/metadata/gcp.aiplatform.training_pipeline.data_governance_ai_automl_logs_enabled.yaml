title: Enable AI Platform AutoML Training Pipeline Audit Logs
rationale: Enabling audit logs for AI Platform AutoML training pipelines is crucial
  for tracking access and changes to machine learning models, which helps in detecting
  unauthorized or anomalous activities. This logging is vital for forensic analysis
  in case of data breaches, ensuring accountability and transparency, and supporting
  compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether audit logs are enabled for the AI Platform AutoML
  training pipelines to ensure that all significant actions are recorded. To verify,
  ensure that logging is configured in the Google Cloud Console under the AI Platform
  settings, specifically under 'Audit Logs'. If not enabled, configure audit logs
  by navigating to the IAM & Admin > Audit Logs section and enabling 'Admin Read',
  'Data Read', and 'Data Write' for the AI Platform service. This ensures comprehensive
  logging of administrative and data access activities.
