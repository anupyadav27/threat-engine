title: Enforce AI Platform Endpoint Content Type Whitelisting
rationale: Enforcing a content type whitelist on AI Platform endpoints minimizes the
  risk of malicious data being processed, which could lead to unauthorized access
  or data breaches. This control helps protect sensitive data and ensures compliance
  with regulatory standards that mandate data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints have a content type whitelist
  configured, restricting data formats to only those explicitly allowed. To verify,
  review the endpoint's configuration in the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud
  CLI to ensure a whitelist is defined. If not configured, update the endpoint settings
  to specify allowed content types, enhancing security by preventing the processing
  of potentially harmful data formats.
