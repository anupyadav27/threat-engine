title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Pipeline Job Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for AI Platform pipeline jobs minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Over-permissioned
  roles can lead to exploitation by malicious actors, impacting business operations
  and violating compliance standards such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule verifies that AI Platform pipeline jobs are configured with
  the least privilege necessary, ensuring that service accounts and users have only
  the permissions required to perform their tasks. To verify compliance, review the
  IAM roles assigned to the pipeline jobs and ensure they align with the principle
  of least privilege. Remediation involves adjusting IAM policies to limit permissions,
  removing unnecessary roles, and applying custom roles where appropriate.
