title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Transform Job Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Transform Job roles minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized access and data leaks, which can lead to financial loss, reputational
  damage, and regulatory non-compliance. Ensuring roles have only necessary permissions
  helps prevent malicious or accidental misuse of sensitive data and resources.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform Batch Prediction Jobs are configured
  with roles that adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it verifies
  that roles attached to these jobs have only the permissions essential for their
  function, reducing the attack surface. To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies
  to ensure roles do not exceed required permissions, using predefined roles or custom
  roles tailored to the job's specific needs.
