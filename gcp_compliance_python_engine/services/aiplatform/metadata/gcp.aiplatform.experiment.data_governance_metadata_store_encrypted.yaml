subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Metadata Store Encryption at Rest
rationale: Encrypting the Metadata Store for AI Platform Experiments protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It safeguards intellectual
  property and research data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and CCPA. Failure to encrypt can lead to data leaks that harm business
  reputation and result in financial penalties.
description: This rule checks if the Metadata Store in GCP AI Platform Experiments
  is encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). Verify that the metadata
  store is configured with CMEK by reviewing the AI Platform settings in the Google
  Cloud Console. To remediate, enable encryption at rest using CMEK, which provides
  greater control over encryption keys and meets compliance requirements.
