title: Ensure AI Transform Job Data is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting AI Transform job input and output data mitigates the risk of
  unauthorized data access and helps maintain confidentiality and integrity. This
  is crucial in preventing data breaches and aligns with compliance requirements such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection measures. It also safeguards against
  potential insider threats and reduces the risk of exposure in case of storage system
  compromise.
description: This check ensures that batch prediction job input and output data in
  GCP's AI Platform is encrypted at rest using customer-managed keys (CMKs). Verify
  that Cloud Storage buckets used for storing job data are configured with a CMK for
  encryption. To remediate, configure your Cloud Storage bucket to use a CMK by updating
  the bucket's settings through the GCP Console or by using gcloud CLI commands to
  set a specific KMS key for the bucket.
