title: Ensure AI Platform Endpoints Require Authentication for Data Access
rationale: Requiring authentication for accessing AI Platform endpoints ensures that
  only authorized users can access sensitive data, which mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality,
  especially when handling proprietary or regulated data, and helps organizations
  meet compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks whether authentication is enforced on AI Platform endpoints
  to control access to data. To verify compliance, ensure that all AI Platform endpoint
  configurations require authentication tokens or credentials before granting data
  access. Remediation involves configuring your AI Platform endpoints to enforce authentication
  by setting appropriate IAM policies and using service accounts. Regular audits and
  updates to access controls are recommended to maintain security posture.
