title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Vector Index
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Services Vector Index in GCP's AI Platform
  Feature Store minimizes exposure to the public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This is critical for protecting sensitive data
  and maintaining compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  stringent data protection measures.
description: This rule checks if AI Services Vector Index in the AI Platform Feature
  Store is configured to use private networking, which restricts access to internal
  IPs only. To verify, ensure that the AI Platform Feature Store's network settings
  are configured to use VPC Service Controls or private Google access. Remediation
  involves updating the network configuration to disable public access and enable
  access only through a private network, ensuring compliance with best practices for
  network security.
