service: aiplatform
resource: model
requirement: Data Privacy Registry Artifact Encryption Enabled
scope: aiplatform.model.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AI Platform Model Registry Artifacts are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting registry artifacts in AI Platform is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches, especially given the valuable
  nature of ML models and training datasets. It helps in mitigating risks of data
  leakage and loss, thus preserving intellectual property and maintaining regulatory
  compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if encryption is enabled for data artifacts stored within
  the AI Platform's model registry. To verify, ensure that the AI Platform models
  utilize Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data protection at rest. Remediation
  involves configuring the model registry to use CMEK by specifying a valid key from
  Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) during model creation or update.
