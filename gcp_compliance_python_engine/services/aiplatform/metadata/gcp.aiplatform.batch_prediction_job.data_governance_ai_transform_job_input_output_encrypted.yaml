domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Batch Prediction Job Data Encryption
rationale: Encrypting input and output data for AI Platform batch prediction jobs
  is critical to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This is particularly important to mitigate risks associated with
  data leaks and to comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and
  CCPA. Failure to encrypt data at rest can result in significant legal penalties
  and damage to an organization's reputation.
description: This rule checks that all input and output data associated with AI Platform
  batch prediction jobs are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).
  Verify that the encryption configuration for batch prediction jobs specifies CMEK
  to ensure data is protected at rest. Remediation involves configuring the batch
  prediction job to use CMEK by specifying the key in the job's 'encryptionSpec' field.
  This can be done via the GCP Console, gcloud command-line tool, or the AI Platform
  client libraries.
