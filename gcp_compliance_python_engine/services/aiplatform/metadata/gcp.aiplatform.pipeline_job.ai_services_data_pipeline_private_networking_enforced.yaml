title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Data Pipelines
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI services data pipelines helps protect
  sensitive data from exposure to the public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. This is particularly important for organizations handling
  proprietary or regulated data, as it supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulations while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data during
  processing.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform pipeline jobs are configured to use
  private networking, which restricts network access to authorized internal IPs only.
  To verify compliance, inspect the pipeline job configuration to ensure that private
  networking is enabled, which typically involves setting up a VPC with appropriate
  firewall rules. Remediation involves modifying pipeline configurations to route
  traffic through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and applying necessary firewall rules
  to allow only trusted sources.
