title: Ensure KMS Encryption for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Using KMS encryption for AI Platform pipeline jobs protects sensitive data
  at rest, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. This practice
  helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate robust data protection measures. Encrypting data also mitigates potential
  financial and reputational damage from data leaks.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform pipeline jobs are configured with
  Cloud KMS keys for encryption. The pipeline job must specify a customer-managed
  encryption key (CMEK) to ensure that data is securely encrypted at rest. To verify,
  review pipeline job configurations for the `encryptionSpec` field and confirm it
  references a valid KMS key. To remediate, update the pipeline job to include a KMS
  key in its encryption settings.
