title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Platform Feature Store Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Platform Feature Store ensures that
  users have only the necessary permissions to perform their job functions, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This control is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially in environments handling
  sensitive or proprietary data. Compliance with least privilege principles is often
  a mandate under frameworks like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require strict access
  controls.
description: This rule checks if the AI Platform Feature Store roles are configured
  to adhere to the principle of least privilege. It involves auditing permissions
  granted to users and service accounts, ensuring they align strictly with required
  operational tasks. Remediation includes reviewing IAM policies on Feature Store
  resources and removing or adjusting permissions that exceed the necessary scope
  of access. Verification can be done through the IAM section of the GCP Console or
  using gcloud CLI commands to list and review roles.
