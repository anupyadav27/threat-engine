requirement: Data Governance Roles Least Privilege
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Limiting roles to the least privilege necessary for AI Platform pipeline
  jobs reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Over-privileged
  access can lead to accidental or malicious data manipulation, violating compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, and potentially causing reputational damage
  and financial loss.
description: This rule checks that users and service accounts assigned to AI Platform
  pipeline jobs have the minimal necessary permissions. Ensure roles like 'Viewer'
  or 'Custom Role' with specific permissions are used instead of broad roles like
  'Editor'. Verify by reviewing IAM policies and adjust using the GCP Console or gcloud
  CLI to enforce strict access controls, ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
