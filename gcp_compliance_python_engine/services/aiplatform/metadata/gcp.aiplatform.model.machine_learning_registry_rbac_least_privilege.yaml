title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for AI Platform Models
rationale: Implementing least privilege in ML registry access minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized data exposure and model manipulation, which could lead to operational
  disruptions or regulatory non-compliance. Misconfigured permissions can result in
  data breaches, model theft, or biased model training, impacting business reputation
  and financial stability.
description: This rule checks if permissions assigned to users or service accounts
  accessing AI Platform models adhere to the principle of least privilege. Users should
  only have the minimum roles necessary to perform their tasks, such as Viewer or
  Editor, rather than Owner. Verification involves auditing IAM policies associated
  with AI Platform models for overly permissive roles. Remediation includes adjusting
  IAM roles to limit access based on role-specific duties and regularly reviewing
  access logs for anomalies.
