resource: featurestore
requirement: Ai Services Feature Store Offline Store Gcs Encrypted
scope: aiplatform.featurestore.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Offline Store GCS Buckets are Encrypted in Feature Store
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in GCS ensures that sensitive information is protected
  against unauthorized access and data breaches. This is critical for meeting compliance
  requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate strong data protection
  measures. Failure to encrypt can lead to financial penalties and loss of customer
  trust.
description: This rule checks if the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets used for the
  Offline Store in AI Platform's Feature Store are encrypted using customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption keys (GMEK). To verify, ensure
  that the `encryption_spec` field is configured for the Feature Store with an appropriate
  key name. If not configured, update the Feature Store settings to include encryption
  specifications using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI.
