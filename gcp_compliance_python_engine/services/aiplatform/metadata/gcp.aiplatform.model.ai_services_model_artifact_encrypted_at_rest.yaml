requirement: Ai Services Model Artifact Encrypted At Rest
scope: aiplatform.model.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Service Model Artifacts Are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting AI Service model artifacts at rest protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access and breaches, crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and
  integrity. This is especially important in scenarios where models contain proprietary
  algorithms or sensitive training data. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI-DSS often mandates encryption of sensitive data at rest, reducing
  the risk of financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform model artifacts are encrypted at
  rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that the encryption configuration is set in the AI Platform
  settings. Remediation involves configuring the AI Platform to use CMEK by specifying
  the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) key during model creation or updating existing
  models to include encryption settings.
