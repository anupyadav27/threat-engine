title: Ensure AI Platform Custom Job Inter-Container Traffic Encryption
rationale: Encrypting inter-container traffic in AI Platform Custom Jobs mitigates
  the risk of data interception and unauthorized access during data exchanges between
  containers. This is crucial for protecting sensitive training data and models from
  potential man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that inter-container traffic for AI Platform Custom
  Jobs is encrypted. Check the configuration settings to ensure that the 'enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption'
  flag is set to true for custom jobs. If not enabled, update the job configuration
  to enforce encryption. This can be done via the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud
  CLI by specifying the appropriate flag in your custom job configuration file.
