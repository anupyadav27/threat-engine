title: Ensure AI Platform Datasets Use CMEK for Encryption at Rest
rationale: Utilizing Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting AI Platform
  datasets at rest significantly enhances data security by giving organizations control
  over their encryption keys. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access
  and aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which demand strict
  data protection measures. Failure to implement CMEK can result in data breaches,
  legal penalties, and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform datasets are encrypted at rest using
  Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure that dataset configurations
  specify a CMEK key from Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Remediation involves
  updating dataset settings to include a CMEK key, which requires appropriate permissions
  to access and manage keys within Cloud KMS. This enhances control over data encryption
  processes and supports compliance with stringent data protection standards.
