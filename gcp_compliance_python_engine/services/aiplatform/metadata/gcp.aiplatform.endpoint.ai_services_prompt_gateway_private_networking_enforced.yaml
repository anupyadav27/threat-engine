domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Prompt Gateway
rationale: Ensuring AI Services Prompt Gateway endpoints use private networking reduces
  exposure to public internet vulnerabilities, mitigating risks of unauthorized access
  or data breaches. This control supports compliance with data protection regulations
  and enhances overall cloud security posture by limiting network attack surfaces.
description: This rule checks if AI Services Prompt Gateway endpoints are configured
  to use private networking by verifying the absence of public IP addresses and the
  presence of VPC Service Controls. To enforce private networking, configure endpoints
  within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and restrict access using firewall rules and
  private service access. Remediation involves updating endpoint settings to disable
  public IPs and ensuring they are only accessible within the private network.
