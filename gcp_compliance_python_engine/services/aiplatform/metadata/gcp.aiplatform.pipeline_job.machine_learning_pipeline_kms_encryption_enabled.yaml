domain: data_protection_and_privacy

title: Enable KMS Encryption for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for machine learning pipeline jobs on GCP secures
  sensitive data by ensuring that it is encrypted at rest. This reduces the risk of
  unauthorized access and data breaches, safeguarding intellectual property and personal
  data. Compliance with industry standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often requires
  encryption of sensitive data, making this a critical control for organizations handling
  regulated data.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform pipeline jobs have Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS) encryption enabled. To verify, ensure the 'encryptionSpec.kmsKeyName'
  field is specified in the pipeline job configuration. Remediation involves updating
  the pipeline job settings to include a valid KMS key, providing enhanced security
  by encrypting the data processed by the pipeline. This configuration helps maintain
  data confidentiality and integrity.
