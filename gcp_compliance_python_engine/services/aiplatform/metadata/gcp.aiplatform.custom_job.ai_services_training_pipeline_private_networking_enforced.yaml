title: Ensure Private Networking for AI Training Pipelines
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI training pipelines reduces the attack
  surface by preventing unauthorized or unintended access from the public internet.
  This configuration mitigates risks of data breaches and ensures that sensitive machine
  learning data remains within secure network boundaries, aligning with compliance
  mandates like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether AI Services Training Pipelines are configured
  to use private networking. It ensures that custom jobs in AI Platform are executed
  within a VPC, preventing exposure to the public internet. To verify, check the network
  settings of the custom job for a private IP configuration. If not compliant, configure
  the custom job to utilize a VPC network with appropriate firewall rules to restrict
  access.
