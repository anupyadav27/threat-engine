title: Enable Logging for ML Hyperparameter Optimization in AI Platform
rationale: Enabling logs for Machine Learning hyperparameter optimization (HPO) pipelines
  in Google Cloud AI Platform helps organizations monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize
  their ML models effectively. This practice reduces security risks by enabling visibility
  into data processing activities and supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  that mandate logging of critical operations. It also aids in detecting potential
  misconfigurations and unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for hyperparameter optimization
  (HPO) in Google Cloud AI Platform training pipelines. Ensuring logs are active allows
  teams to capture detailed information about the HPO process, which is essential
  for debugging and improving model performance. To enable logging, navigate to the
  AI Platform's Training Pipelines section, and configure logging settings to capture
  detailed operational data. Regularly review these logs to maintain optimal security
  and compliance posture.
