service: aiplatform
resource: model
requirement: Machine Learning Package Not Publicly Shared
scope: aiplatform.model.public_access
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Prevent Public Sharing of AI Platform Models
rationale: Publicly shared machine learning models can expose sensitive algorithms
  and data, leading to intellectual property theft or misuse. Unauthorized access
  can result in model tampering or data leaks, violating compliance with frameworks
  like GDPR and HIPAA, and potentially causing reputational and financial damage.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform models are publicly accessible, which
  could lead to unauthorized use or data breaches. Ensure that model IAM policies
  do not grant 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' roles. Remediation involves reviewing
  model access policies and restricting permissions to specified users or service
  accounts only. Verify settings using the Google Cloud Console or CLI, and update
  policies to comply with the principle of least privilege.
