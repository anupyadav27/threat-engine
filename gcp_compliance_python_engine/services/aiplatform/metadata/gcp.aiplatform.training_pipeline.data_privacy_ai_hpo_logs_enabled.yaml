title: Enable AI HPO Logs for Enhanced Data Privacy in Training Pipelines
rationale: Enabling AI Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) logs is crucial for maintaining
  data privacy, as it helps track and audit model training processes. This reduces
  the risk of unauthorized data access and supports compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Without these logs, organizations may face data
  breaches or non-compliance fines, potentially harming their reputation and financial
  standing.
description: This rule checks whether AI HPO logs are enabled for training pipelines
  on Google Cloud AI Platform. To verify, ensure that logging is configured to capture
  all relevant HPO activities within the AI Platform's training pipelines. Remediation
  involves enabling logging through the AI Platform settings and ensuring that logs
  are stored securely with appropriate access controls. This helps in monitoring and
  auditing AI training activities, providing an additional layer of security for sensitive
  data.
