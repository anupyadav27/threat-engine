title: Use Vault for AI Platform Training Pipeline Secrets
rationale: Storing secrets in Google Cloud Vault ensures they are encrypted and access-controlled,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. This practice aligns
  with compliance requirements for data protection and supports the integrity of AI
  models by safeguarding sensitive information. It mitigates the risk of exposure
  during AI pipeline execution, which could lead to intellectual property theft or
  data misuse.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform Training Pipelines only use secrets
  stored in Google Cloud Vault. By ensuring secrets are managed by Vault, you leverage
  its robust access control and encryption capabilities. To verify, inspect the AI
  Platform custom job configurations and confirm secrets are sourced from Vault. Remediation
  involves updating your pipeline configurations to reference secrets stored in Vault,
  ensuring consistent security practices.
