title: Enforce Private Networking for AI HPO Training Pipelines
rationale: Private networking in AI HPO (Hyperparameter Optimization) ensures that
  data and model training processes are protected from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By enforcing private networking, organizations can mitigate risks
  associated with exposure to public networks, ensuring compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This practice also aligns with security best
  practices, reducing the attack surface and enhancing data confidentiality.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform Training Pipelines with hyperparameter
  optimization (HPO) are configured to use private networking, preventing exposure
  to public IP addresses. To verify, ensure that the 'network' parameter is set to
  a VPC network in the training pipeline configuration. Remediation involves updating
  pipeline configurations to specify a private VPC network, providing an isolated
  and secure environment for data processing and model training.
