scope: aiplatform.endpoint.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure KMS Encryption Enabled for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI Platform endpoints protects sensitive data
  and models from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This feature helps
  organizations comply with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require
  robust data protection measures. Failure to encrypt data at rest increases the risk
  of exposure to cyber threats and can lead to significant financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints are configured to use Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data encryption at rest. To verify, ensure the endpoint
  configuration includes a valid KMS key resource identifier. Remediation involves
  updating the endpoint settings to specify a KMS key, which can be done through the
  Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI. It is crucial to regularly audit and manage
  encryption keys to maintain data security.
