title: Ensure AI Platform Experiment Metadata Store Encryption
rationale: Encrypting the metadata store in AI Platform experiments is crucial for
  protecting sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  This practice helps mitigate risks of data exposure in case of security incidents
  and ensures compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  encryption of sensitive information at rest.
description: "This rule checks whether the metadata store associated with AI Platform\
  \ experiments is encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). To verify,\
  \ ensure that the encryption configuration specifies a valid CMEK. Remediation involves\
  \ configuring AI Platform to use CMEK for the metadata store by updating the experiment\u2019\
  s encryption settings in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI commands. This enhances\
  \ control over encryption keys and aligns with best practices for data protection."
