title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Batch Prediction Jobs
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Platform batch prediction jobs minimizes
  the attack surface by restricting access to only necessary roles and permissions,
  thus reducing the risk of unauthorized data access or manipulation. This is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with regulations such as
  GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate strict access controls.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to batch prediction jobs in the
  AI Platform adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure that service accounts
  associated with these jobs have only the permissions necessary to perform their
  functions. Review and update IAM policies to eliminate excessive permissions, and
  regularly audit roles to maintain minimal access. Remediation involves adjusting
  IAM settings to align with GCP's best practices for access control.
