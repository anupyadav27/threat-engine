title: Ensure AI Training Job Roles Have Least Privilege
rationale: Assigning excessive permissions to AI training job roles can expose sensitive
  data and increase the risk of data breaches. By adhering to the principle of least
  privilege, organizations can minimize potential attack vectors and protect sensitive
  datasets used during AI model training. This practice supports compliance with data
  protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent access control
  to personal data.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to AI Platform Custom Jobs are limited
  to the minimum necessary permissions. It verifies that the roles are not overly
  permissive and do not include access to resources unrelated to the job's function.
  To comply, review the roles assigned to each custom job and ensure they align strictly
  with the job's operational requirements, removing any unnecessary permissions. Use
  GCP IAM policy analysis tools to identify and rectify any discrepancies.
