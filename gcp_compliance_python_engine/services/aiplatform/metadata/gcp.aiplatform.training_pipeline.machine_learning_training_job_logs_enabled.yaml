title: Enable Logging for AI Platform Training Jobs
rationale: Enabling logs for AI Platform training jobs is crucial for monitoring and
  troubleshooting machine learning workflows. This practice helps in detecting anomalies,
  understanding model performance, and ensuring accountability by maintaining an audit
  trail of all activities. It also supports compliance with regulations that mandate
  logging of data processing activities, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for AI Platform training jobs,
  ensuring that the logs are captured and stored for review and analysis. To verify,
  ensure that the 'enableLogging' flag is set to true in the training pipeline configuration.
  Remediation involves updating the training pipeline's configuration to include logging
  settings, which can be done via the GCP Console, gcloud command-line tool, or by
  updating the pipeline configuration script.
