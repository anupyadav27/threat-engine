domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure ML Data Capture Buckets Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
rationale: Encrypting machine learning data capture buckets using customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized
  access and potential breaches. This practice supports regulatory compliance with
  standards like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate robust data protection measures. It
  also mitigates risks associated with data leaks or unauthorized data manipulation,
  ultimately safeguarding intellectual property and building customer trust.
description: This rule checks if the machine learning data capture bucket associated
  with an AI Platform endpoint is encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys.
  To verify, ensure that the bucket's encryption configuration specifies a valid CMEK.
  Remediation involves creating a CMEK in Cloud KMS and configuring the bucket to
  use this key for encryption. This ensures that you maintain control over the encryption
  keys and comply with organizational policies on data security.
