domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Encrypt Input and Output for AI Platform Batch Jobs
rationale: Ensuring that input and output data of AI Platform batch prediction jobs
  are encrypted is crucial to protect sensitive machine learning data from unauthorized
  access and breaches. Unencrypted data can lead to exposure of proprietary algorithms
  or customer information, violating compliance requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA,
  and resulting in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if the input and output files for AI Platform batch
  prediction jobs are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To
  verify, ensure that the 'encryptionSpec' field is configured with a valid KMS key
  in the job settings. Remediation involves modifying the job configuration to specify
  a CMEK, thereby securing data at rest and aligning with best practices for data
  protection.
