title: Ensure Network Isolation for AI Training Jobs
rationale: Enabling network isolation for AI training jobs protects sensitive data
  from unauthorized network access and mitigates risks such as data leakage and unauthorized
  data manipulation. This control is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and
  integrity of AI models, especially in industries with stringent data protection
  regulations like healthcare and finance. It supports compliance with standards such
  as NIST SP 800-53, which emphasizes secure network configurations.
description: This rule verifies that network isolation is enabled for AI Platform
  custom training jobs by checking if a valid VPC is configured. Network isolation
  prevents jobs from accessing the public internet, reducing exposure to external
  threats. To enable it, specify a VPC network when creating or updating an AI custom
  job. Validate configuration through the GCP Console or gcloud CLI by ensuring the
  'network' field is set in the job configuration.
