title: Enforce AI Services Private Networking for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI services minimizes exposure to the
  public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This
  is crucial for protecting sensitive machine learning models and data, ensuring compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, and maintaining customer trust by safeguarding
  intellectual property.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints are configured to use private
  networking, ensuring that traffic is restricted to internal networks. To verify
  compliance, review the AI Platform endpoint configuration to confirm that private
  IP addresses are used. Remediation involves updating endpoint settings to enable
  private networking, which can be done through the GCP Console or gcloud CLI by specifying
  a private network during endpoint creation.
