subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Human Review UI Uses Private Network in AI Platform Pipelines
rationale: Enforcing private network connections for the AI Human Review UI in AI
  Platform pipelines reduces exposure to unauthorized access, minimizing data breaches
  and protecting sensitive information. This control is crucial for maintaining confidentiality
  and integrity, particularly when handling regulated or proprietary data, and supports
  compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that AI Platform pipeline jobs utilize a private network
  for the AI Human Review UI, enhancing data governance through network isolation.
  Check that the 'network' field in pipeline job configuration specifies a private
  VPC. Remediation involves updating the pipeline job configuration to include a private
  VPC network, ensuring all data interactions are confined within a controlled environment.
