title: Enable Logging for AI Platform Batch Prediction Jobs
rationale: Enabling logs for AI Platform Batch Prediction Jobs is crucial for monitoring,
  troubleshooting, and auditing activities within the machine learning environment.
  Without logging, it becomes challenging to identify and respond to security incidents,
  compliance breaches, or performance issues, potentially leading to financial losses
  or regulatory penalties.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for AI Platform Batch Prediction
  Jobs. To ensure compliance and security, configure your jobs to send logs to Cloud
  Logging. Verify the setting by inspecting the job configurations in the Google Cloud
  Console or via the gcloud CLI. To enable logging, set the 'logging' parameter to
  'true' in the job configuration. This allows capturing of job activity, facilitating
  monitoring and troubleshooting.
