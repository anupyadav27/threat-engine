title: Ensure AI Platform Dataset Access Logs are Enabled
rationale: Enabling access logging for AI Platform datasets is crucial for detecting
  unauthorized access and ensuring accountability. Without logging, organizations
  risk undetected data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate detailed access records for sensitive data. Accurate
  logs are also essential for forensic investigations and maintaining a strong security
  posture.
description: This rule checks if access logging is enabled for datasets in Google
  Cloud's AI Platform. To verify, ensure that Cloud Audit Logs are configured to capture
  'DATA_READ' and 'DATA_WRITE' for 'aiplatform.googleapis.com'. Remediation involves
  enabling audit logging in the IAM & admin settings of the Google Cloud Console.
  This will help in tracking access and modifications to datasets, providing an audit
  trail for compliance and security purposes.
