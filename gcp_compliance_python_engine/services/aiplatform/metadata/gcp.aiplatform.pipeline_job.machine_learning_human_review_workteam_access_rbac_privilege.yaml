resource: pipeline_job
requirement: Machine Learning Human Review Workteam Access RBAC Privilege
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure ML Human Review Workteam RBAC Privilege is Minimally Scoped
rationale: Properly scoping access for machine learning human review workteams is
  crucial to prevent unauthorized data exposure and manipulation, which can lead to
  data breaches and compromise model integrity. Inadequate access management can result
  in non-compliance with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA, posing legal
  and financial risks.
description: This rule checks if the role-based access control (RBAC) privileges assigned
  to machine learning human review workteams are aligned with the principle of least
  privilege. Verify that only necessary permissions are granted to perform specific
  review tasks by auditing IAM policies associated with pipeline jobs. Remediation
  involves adjusting access levels to ensure compliance with organizational policy
  and relevant regulations, removing unnecessary roles, and periodically reviewing
  access permissions.
