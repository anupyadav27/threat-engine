severity: low
title: Ensure AI Services Authz Policies Are Enforced on Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing authorization policies on AI services endpoints is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Without proper controls, sensitive
  AI models and data can be exposed to malicious actors, leading to potential loss
  of intellectual property and compliance violations. This is particularly important
  for organizations handling sensitive information that must adhere to regulatory
  standards such as GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that authorization policies are enforced on Google Cloud
  AI Platform endpoints. By ensuring that AI services have proper IAM policies applied,
  access can be restricted to only authorized users and applications. To verify, review
  the IAM policies associated with each AI Platform endpoint to confirm they align
  with organizational security requirements. Remediation involves configuring the
  IAM settings to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
