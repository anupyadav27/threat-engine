title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Pipeline Job Roles
rationale: Properly assigning roles with the least privilege principle is crucial
  to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data leakage. Misconfigured roles
  can lead to excessive permissions, increasing the attack surface and potential for
  data breaches. Adhering to least privilege is often a requirement under compliance
  frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, which emphasize data protection and access control.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to users and service accounts for
  AI Platform pipeline jobs are limited to the minimum necessary permissions. It verifies
  that custom roles or predefined roles do not grant broader access than required
  for their function. To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies to ensure roles
  are aligned with job responsibilities and audit access logs regularly to identify
  any deviations from expected usage.
