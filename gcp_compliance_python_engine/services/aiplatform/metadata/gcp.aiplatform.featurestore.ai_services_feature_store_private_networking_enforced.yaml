title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Feature Store
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Feature Store minimizes exposure to
  public internet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This is critical for maintaining data privacy and meeting regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent data protection measures. Private
  networking ensures that sensitive AI data is accessed only through secure, internal
  networks, thereby mitigating potential security threats.
description: This rule checks whether AI Feature Store is configured to use private
  networking, preventing public IP access. Verify that the feature store is set to
  use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks by checking the network configurations
  in the Google Cloud Console under AI Platform. To enforce private networking, configure
  VPC Service Controls and use private endpoints for communication. This ensures that
  all data traffic remains within Google's secure infrastructure.
