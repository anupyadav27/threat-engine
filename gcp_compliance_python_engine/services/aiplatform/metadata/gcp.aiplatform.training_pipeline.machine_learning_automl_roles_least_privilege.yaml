title: Ensure Least Privilege for AutoML Roles in Training Pipelines
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AutoML roles in GCP's AI Platform is crucial
  to minimize potential unauthorized access and data breaches. Over-privileged accounts
  can lead to accidental or malicious misuse of resources, causing significant business
  disruption and financial loss. Furthermore, adhering to least privilege principles
  helps in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict
  access controls.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to users and service accounts in
  AI Platform training pipelines are limited to only those permissions necessary for
  their tasks. It involves reviewing IAM policies to ensure no excessive permissions
  are granted beyond what is needed for AutoML operations. Remediation involves adjusting
  IAM roles to align with the principle of least privilege by using predefined roles
  or creating custom roles tailored to specific needs.
