title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Batch Prediction Jobs
rationale: Ensuring least privilege for AI Platform batch prediction jobs minimizes
  potential exposure of sensitive data by restricting access to only necessary roles.
  This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, which is crucial
  for maintaining data privacy and meeting compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to AI Platform batch prediction
  jobs adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring no excessive permissions
  are granted. Verify IAM policies to ensure only necessary roles are assigned, such
  as roles/aiplatform.user, while avoiding overly permissive roles like roles/owner.
  To remediate, review and adjust IAM roles using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud
  CLI to align with least privilege best practices.
