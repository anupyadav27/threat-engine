title: Enable Data Governance Logs for AI Platform Experiments
rationale: Enabling data governance logs for AI Platform experiments is crucial for
  tracking data access and changes, which helps in identifying unauthorized access
  and ensuring data integrity. This capability allows organizations to meet compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and CCPA by providing a clear audit trail of data usage.
  Additionally, it aids in forensic investigations by offering detailed logs that
  help mitigate the risk of data breaches and insider threats.
description: This rule checks if data governance logging is enabled for AI Platform
  experiments. To verify, ensure that audit logs are configured to capture 'DATA_READ',
  'DATA_WRITE', and 'ADMIN_READ' activities for the relevant AI Platform resources.
  Remediation involves enabling audit logging in the Google Cloud Console under the
  'Logging' section for AI Platform resources. This will ensure that any access or
  modifications to experiment data are logged appropriately, enhancing the security
  posture of the AI Platform.
