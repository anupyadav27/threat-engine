title: Ensure ML Training Job Data is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting machine learning training job input and output data at rest
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access, which is crucial for maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity. This is particularly important in industries
  with strict compliance requirements such as healthcare and finance, where sensitive
  data protection is mandated by regulations like HIPAA and PCI-DSS. Failing to encrypt
  data can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether the data used in and produced by AI Platform
  training pipelines is encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).
  To verify, ensure that the training pipeline is configured with CMEK through the
  Google Cloud Console or using the AI Platform API. Remediation involves specifying
  a customer-managed key during the creation of the training pipeline, which provides
  greater control over data security and compliance with organizational policies.
