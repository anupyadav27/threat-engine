title: Ensure Content Type Whitelisting on AI Endpoint Configurations
rationale: Enforcing content type whitelisting on AI endpoint configurations is crucial
  to prevent data leakage and unauthorized data processing, which can lead to compliance
  violations and reputational damage. This control helps mitigate risks of improper
  data handling and exposure to potential security vulnerabilities by ensuring only
  approved data formats are processed.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform endpoint configurations have content
  type whitelisting enforced, which restricts data input to predefined formats. To
  verify, review the endpoint configuration settings in the Google Cloud Console for
  content type specifications. Remediation involves updating the endpoint configurations
  to include valid and approved content types only, ensuring alignment with organizational
  data policies.
