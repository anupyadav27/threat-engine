title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Training Jobs
rationale: Ensuring AI training jobs use private networking is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive data. Without this configuration, training data
  can be exposed to public networks, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This measure helps maintain data confidentiality
  and integrity, crucial for trust and compliance in AI operations.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform custom jobs are configured to use private
  networking, restricting access to internal networks only. Verify that the 'network'
  field in AI Platform job configurations specifies a private VPC. Remediation involves
  setting up a VPC with appropriate firewall rules and ensuring AI Platform jobs reference
  this network. Confirm this setting via the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to protect
  data in transit.
