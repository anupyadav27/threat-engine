subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Restrict KMS Keys for AI Platform Endpoint Config
rationale: Restricting KMS keys for AI Platform endpoints ensures that only authorized
  keys are used for encrypting machine learning configurations, protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and supports
  compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strong
  data protection measures.
description: This rule checks that only whitelisted KMS keys are used for encrypting
  AI Platform endpoint configurations. Ensure that endpoints are configured with specific
  KMS keys that adhere to your organization's encryption policies. To verify, review
  the endpoint's configuration in the GCP console or use the gcloud CLI to list the
  KMS keys in use and compare them with the approved list. Remediate by updating the
  endpoint configuration to use the correct KMS key and restrict access to unauthorized
  keys.
