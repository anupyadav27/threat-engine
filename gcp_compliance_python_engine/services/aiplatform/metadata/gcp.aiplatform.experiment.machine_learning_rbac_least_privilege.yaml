service: aiplatform
resource: experiment
requirement: Machine Learning RBAC Least Privilege
scope: aiplatform.experiment.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Platform Experiment RBAC
rationale: Limiting permissions to the least privilege necessary for AI Platform experiments
  reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This approach
  mitigates insider threats and ensures compliance with data protection regulations
  by minimizing the exposure of sensitive machine learning models and datasets.
description: This rule verifies that role-based access control (RBAC) for AI Platform
  experiments is configured to follow the principle of least privilege. Ensure that
  users and service accounts have only the permissions necessary to perform their
  specific tasks. Regularly audit and adjust permissions, removing unnecessary or
  excessive roles. Remediation involves using IAM policies to assign roles at the
  appropriate resource level and reviewing permissions periodically.
