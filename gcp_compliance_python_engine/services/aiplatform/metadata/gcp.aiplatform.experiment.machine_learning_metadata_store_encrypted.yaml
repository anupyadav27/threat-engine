subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure ML Metadata Store is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting the Machine Learning Metadata Store ensures that sensitive data,
  such as model parameters and training data lineage, is protected from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Unencrypted data can lead to compliance violations
  and exposure of intellectual property, increasing the risk of data theft and business
  disruption.
description: This rule checks whether the Machine Learning Metadata Store in GCP's
  AI Platform is encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).
  To verify, review the metadata store's configuration in the GCP Cloud Console or
  use the gcloud CLI to ensure CMEK is enabled. If not configured, enable CMEK by
  updating the metadata store settings to use a Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)
  key. This enhances the security and compliance posture by ensuring data encryption
  aligns with organizational policies.
