requirement: Data Governance Ai Human Review Artifacts Encrypted
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Human Review Artifacts are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting AI human review artifacts at rest protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. This is crucial for maintaining
  trust with stakeholders and preventing potential financial and reputational damage
  from data leaks.
description: This rule checks whether AI human review artifacts within AI Platform
  Pipeline Jobs are encrypted at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).
  To verify, ensure that encryption settings in the pipeline job configurations are
  set to use CMEK. Remediation involves updating the pipeline job configuration to
  specify a CMEK for encrypting artifacts, which can be done via the GCP Console or
  gcloud command-line tool by setting the appropriate encryption key during job creation.
