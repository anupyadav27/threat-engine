title: Ensure RBAC for AI Human Review Workteam in Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for AI Human Review Workteams is
  critical to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data processed in AI pipelines.
  Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and loss of
  trust. Ensuring appropriate privileges helps mitigate risks associated with data
  privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if AI Human Review Workteams involved in AI Platform
  pipeline jobs have the necessary and appropriate roles assigned. Configurations
  should ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data, following
  the principle of least privilege. To verify, review IAM permissions for workteams
  associated with pipeline jobs and adjust roles to match their responsibilities.
  Remediation involves updating IAM policies to restrict access to only those who
  require it for their job functions.
