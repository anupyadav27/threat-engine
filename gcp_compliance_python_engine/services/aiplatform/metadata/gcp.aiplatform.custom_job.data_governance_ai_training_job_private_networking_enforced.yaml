title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Training Jobs
rationale: Private networking for AI training jobs is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and mitigate potential data exfiltration risks. This enhances data governance
  by ensuring that sensitive data processed during AI training remains within a controlled
  network environment, aligning with compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform Custom Jobs are configured to use private
  networking, which restricts traffic to private IP addresses and prevents exposure
  to the public internet. To verify, ensure that the 'network' field in the custom
  job configuration specifies a VPC network. Remediation involves updating the custom
  job configurations to include a VPC network that aligns with organizational security
  policies.
