title: Ensure AI Services Pipeline Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling logging for AI Services pipeline jobs is crucial for monitoring
  and auditing purposes. It helps in detecting anomalies, understanding user behavior,
  and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
  Inadequate logging can result in undetected security incidents and non-compliance
  with legal and regulatory mandates.
description: This check verifies that logging is enabled for AI Platform pipeline
  jobs, ensuring that all operations are recorded and auditable. It involves configuring
  the AI Platform to capture logs related to pipeline execution, which can be reviewed
  for troubleshooting and compliance audits. To enable logging, configure the AI Platform
  to integrate with Cloud Logging and ensure that the appropriate log sinks are set
  up to capture pipeline job activities. This can be done through the Google Cloud
  Console or using gcloud commands.
