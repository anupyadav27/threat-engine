title: Ensure Data Privacy Logging is Enabled for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Enabling data privacy logging for AI Platform pipeline jobs is crucial
  for monitoring access and usage of sensitive data, which helps in identifying unauthorized
  access and mitigating data breaches. It supports compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA by providing audit trails that demonstrate adherence
  to privacy policies. This practice also aids in detecting anomalies and ensuring
  accountability in data processing activities.
description: This rule checks whether data privacy logging is enabled for AI Platform
  pipeline jobs, ensuring that all data access and processing activities are logged
  and monitored. To verify, ensure that logging is configured in the AI Platform settings
  by enabling 'logConfig' for pipeline jobs. Remediation involves updating the pipeline
  job specifications to include the necessary logging configurations, allowing for
  comprehensive data access tracking.
