title: Enable Logs for AI Transform Jobs to Protect Data Privacy
rationale: Enabling logs for AI Transform jobs in GCP is crucial to monitor and audit
  data access and transformations, ensuring data privacy is maintained. Without logging,
  unauthorized data manipulation might go undetected, potentially leading to data
  breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Effective logging
  supports incident response and forensic analysis, reducing the risk of data leaks
  and enhancing trust in AI operations.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for AI Transform jobs within batch
  prediction jobs on GCP's AI Platform. To verify, ensure that the 'log_ttl_days'
  configuration is set for the batch prediction job, indicating that logs are retained
  for auditing. Remediation involves adjusting the AI Platform job settings to enable
  and configure logging, ensuring logs are stored in a secure GCP Logging bucket with
  appropriate access controls.
