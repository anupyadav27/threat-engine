title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Experiment Access
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege in AI Platform experiments minimizes
  risk by limiting data access to only those who need it for their roles. This reduces
  the potential for data breaches and unauthorized access, which can lead to data
  leaks and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Failing to implement
  this can result in significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to users for accessing AI Platform
  experiments adhere to the principle of least privilege. It requires that permissions
  granted are strictly necessary for job functions, reducing excess access. To verify
  compliance, review IAM policies on AI Platform resources, ensuring that users have
  the minimum required roles. Remediation involves adjusting IAM roles and permissions
  to remove unnecessary access rights, potentially using predefined roles instead
  of overly permissive custom roles.
