title: Ensure AI Platform Model Artifacts are Signed and Verified
rationale: Ensuring that AI Platform model artifacts are signed and verified is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications. Unsigned
  or unverified artifacts pose a risk of data breaches, intellectual property theft,
  and non-compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. This
  practice helps protect sensitive data and intellectual property while supporting
  trust in AI models.
description: This rule checks that all data privacy package artifacts for AI Platform
  models are signed and verified to ensure authenticity and integrity. Organizations
  should leverage GCP's Artifact Registry to sign artifacts and use Binary Authorization
  to verify signatures before deployment. Regularly audit artifact signing processes
  and implement automated alerts for unsigned or tampered artifacts to mitigate risks.
  Remediation involves signing all unsigned artifacts and configuring verification
  policies.
