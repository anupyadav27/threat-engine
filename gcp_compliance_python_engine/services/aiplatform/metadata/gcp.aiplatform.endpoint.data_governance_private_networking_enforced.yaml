subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Private Networking for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform endpoints mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting network exposure to only
  trusted internal networks. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data processed
  by AI models and complying with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA,
  which mandate stringent data handling and privacy controls.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints are configured to use private
  networking, ensuring they are not exposed to the public internet. To verify, ensure
  that endpoints are accessible only via internal IPs within a Google Cloud VPC. Remediation
  involves configuring endpoints to use the 'privateEndpoints' setting, allowing only
  VPC-based access and ensuring the appropriate VPC service controls are applied.
