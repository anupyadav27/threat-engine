domain: data_protection_and_privacy

title: Ensure Vector Index Encryption at Rest with CMEK
rationale: Encrypting the AI Services Vector Index at rest using Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) provides enhanced control over the encryption process. This
  practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access, aligns with regulatory
  compliance requirements, and ensures that sensitive data remains secure even if
  the underlying storage is compromised.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform Featurestore's Vector Index is encrypted
  at rest using CMEK. To verify, ensure that the Featurestore resource is configured
  with a customer-managed key rather than the default Google-managed keys. If not
  configured, update the Featurestore settings to specify a CMEK for encryption. This
  can be done through the GCP Console or CLI by setting the 'encryptionSpec.kmsKeyName'
  field to the desired Cloud KMS key.
