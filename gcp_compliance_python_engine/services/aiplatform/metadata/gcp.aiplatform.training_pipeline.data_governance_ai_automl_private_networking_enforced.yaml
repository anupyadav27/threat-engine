title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Platform AutoML
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform AutoML training pipelines
  helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration. By ensuring
  that models are trained in a secure, private network, organizations can maintain
  data confidentiality and integrity, which is crucial for compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This also reduces exposure to potential cyber
  threats and enhances the overall security posture of the AI infrastructure.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform AutoML training pipelines are configured
  to use private networking, ensuring that all data and model training processes remain
  within a secure internal network. To verify, inspect the network configuration settings
  of the training pipeline to confirm that it is set to use a private IP range. Remediation
  involves updating the network settings of the pipeline to utilize a VPC that does
  not allow public IP addresses, ensuring all traffic remains private and internal.
