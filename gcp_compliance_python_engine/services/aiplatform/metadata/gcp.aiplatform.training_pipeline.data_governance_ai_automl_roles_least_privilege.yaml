subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure AI Platform Training Pipelines Use Least Privilege Roles
rationale: Assigning excessive permissions to AI Platform training pipelines can lead
  to unauthorized data access, accidental data modification, and increased risk of
  insider threats. Ensuring least privilege helps protect sensitive data, supports
  compliance with data protection regulations, and minimizes potential attack vectors.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform training pipelines are assigned only
  the minimal roles necessary for their operation, specifically focusing on Automl
  roles. Verify roles by reviewing IAM policies attached to training pipelines and
  ensure they are limited to essential permissions. If over-privileged roles are identified,
  modify IAM policies to restrict access to only what is necessary for the pipeline's
  functionality.
