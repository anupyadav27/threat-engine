title: Enforce AI Services Agent Orchestrator Tool Allowlist
rationale: Enforcing an allowlist for AI Services Agent Orchestrator tools helps mitigate
  security risks by ensuring only authorized tools can orchestrate AI workloads, reducing
  the attack surface. This approach is crucial for maintaining data integrity and
  preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of AI pipelines, aligning with compliance
  requirements like SOC2 and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether an allowlist is enforced for tools used by the
  AI Services Agent Orchestrator in GCP AI Platform pipeline jobs. To verify, ensure
  that the allowlist is configured in the IAM policies, restricting tool access to
  only those explicitly approved. Remediation involves updating IAM policies to include
  a specific list of permitted tools, thereby preventing unauthorized orchestration
  activities.
