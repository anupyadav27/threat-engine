title: Enforce ML Endpoint Authz Policies in AI Platform
rationale: Ensuring that machine learning endpoints are protected with robust authorization
  policies prevents unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches, model
  theft, or service disruptions. Proper enforcement of these policies is crucial for
  maintaining the integrity of machine learning operations and complying with regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if authorization policies are enforced on AI Platform
  endpoints to control access. It verifies that Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  roles and policies are correctly configured to only allow permitted entities to
  interact with endpoints. Remediation involves reviewing IAM configurations, ensuring
  that least privilege principles are applied, and updating policies to restrict access
  appropriately.
