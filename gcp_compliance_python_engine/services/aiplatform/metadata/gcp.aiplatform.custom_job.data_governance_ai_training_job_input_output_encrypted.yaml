domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Encryption of AI Platform Custom Job Data at Rest
rationale: Encrypting input and output data for AI training jobs in Google's AI Platform
  Custom Jobs is critical to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. This practice mitigates risks related to data leakage
  and ensures compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate
  strong data protection measures.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for input and output data
  of AI Platform Custom Jobs. To verify, ensure that the AI Platform Custom Job configuration
  specifies a valid customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) for data at rest. If encryption
  is not configured, update the job settings to include a CMEK to enhance data protection.
  This can be done via the Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud CLI by specifying
  the --kms-key-name flag when creating or updating jobs.
