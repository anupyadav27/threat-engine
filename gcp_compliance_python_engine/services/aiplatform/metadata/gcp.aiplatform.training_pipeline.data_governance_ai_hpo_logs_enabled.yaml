title: Ensure AI Platform HPO Logs Are Enabled for Training Pipelines
rationale: Enabling HPO logs for AI Platform training pipelines is critical for tracking
  hyperparameter optimization processes, which can help in auditing AI model training
  activities. This logging aids in identifying potential anomalies or misconfigurations,
  and ensures transparency and accountability, which are essential for complying with
  data governance frameworks and regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks if hyperparameter optimization logs are enabled for
  AI Platform training pipelines on GCP. Proper logging settings should be configured
  to capture all relevant events, which can be verified through the AI Platform console
  or via the gcloud CLI. To remediate, ensure that logging is activated under the
  'Training Pipelines' section in AI Platform, confirming that the 'Hyperparameter
  Optimization Logs' option is set to active.
