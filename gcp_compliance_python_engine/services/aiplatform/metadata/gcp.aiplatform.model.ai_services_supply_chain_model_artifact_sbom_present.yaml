title: Ensure SBOM Present for AI Services Supply Chain Model Artifacts
rationale: Having a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for AI models is critical for
  transparency and security in the AI supply chain. It helps identify components and
  dependencies, mitigating risks of vulnerabilities and compliance failures due to
  unverified third-party software. This practice supports regulatory requirements
  and enhances trust in AI deployments by providing a clear understanding of software
  components used.
description: This rule checks that every AI model artifact in the AI Platform has
  an associated SBOM. An SBOM provides a detailed inventory of all software components,
  including versioning and licensing information. To verify, ensure the SBOM is generated
  and stored alongside the model artifacts in your repository. Regularly update the
  SBOM as part of your CI/CD pipeline to reflect any changes. Remediation involves
  generating an SBOM using tools like Syft or CycloneDX and ensuring it's linked to
  the model artifact.
