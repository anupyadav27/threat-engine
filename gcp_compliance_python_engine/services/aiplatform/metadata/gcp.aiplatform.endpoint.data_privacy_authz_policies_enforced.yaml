title: Enforce Data Privacy Policies on AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing data privacy authorization policies on AI Platform endpoints
  is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, reducing the risk
  of data breaches and maintaining customer trust. It also ensures compliance with
  regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls
  and privacy measures for data handling.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform endpoints have data privacy authorization
  policies enforced, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access sensitive
  data. Verification involves reviewing IAM roles and policies associated with each
  endpoint to confirm that they align with organizational data privacy requirements.
  Remediation includes defining and applying appropriate IAM roles that restrict access
  to authorized identities, and leveraging VPC Service Controls for additional security
  boundaries.
