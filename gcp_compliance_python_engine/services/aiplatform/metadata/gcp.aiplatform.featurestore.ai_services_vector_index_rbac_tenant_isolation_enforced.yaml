title: Ensure Tenant Isolation in Feature Store RBAC for AI Services
rationale: Enforcing tenant isolation in AI services vector index RBAC is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage between tenants. Without proper
  isolation, a compromised account or misconfiguration could expose sensitive data
  to unauthorized parties, increasing the risk of data breaches and violating data
  protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is configured to
  enforce tenant isolation in Google's AI Platform Feature Store. It ensures that
  each tenant has access only to their vector indexes, preventing unauthorized access
  to other tenants' data. Verify that roles and permissions are correctly assigned
  to maintain isolation. Remediation involves reviewing and updating IAM policies
  to enforce strict tenant boundaries.
