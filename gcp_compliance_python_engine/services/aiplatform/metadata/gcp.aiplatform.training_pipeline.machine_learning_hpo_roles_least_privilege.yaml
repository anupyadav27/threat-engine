title: Ensure Least Privilege for ML HPO Roles in AI Platform
rationale: Granting excessive permissions to roles associated with machine learning
  hyperparameter optimization (HPO) can expose sensitive data and increase the attack
  surface. Least privilege access helps mitigate risks such as unauthorized data access,
  accidental deletion, or misuse of resources, which are critical for maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of your ML workloads. Additionally, adhering to
  least privilege principles aligns with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001, ensuring an organization's data protection posture is robust.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the principle of least privilege in
  AI Platform training pipelines, specifically for roles involved in machine learning
  hyperparameter optimization. It ensures that roles assigned to users, service accounts,
  or applications have only the necessary permissions needed to perform their functions.
  To verify, audit IAM policies associated with AI Platform and modify roles to restrict
  permissions to the minimum necessary. Remediation involves updating IAM policies
  and roles to remove excess permissions and regularly reviewing access logs for compliance.
