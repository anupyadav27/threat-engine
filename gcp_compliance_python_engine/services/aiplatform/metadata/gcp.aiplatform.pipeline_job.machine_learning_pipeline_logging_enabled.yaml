title: Enable Logging for Machine Learning Pipelines in GCP AI Platform
rationale: Enabling logging for machine learning pipelines ensures comprehensive audit
  trails, aiding in the detection of anomalies, troubleshooting, and ensuring compliance
  with data governance policies. Insufficient logging can lead to undetected unauthorized
  activities or misconfigurations, posing a risk to data integrity and confidentiality.
  Compliance with frameworks like SOC2 and ISO 27001 often requires detailed logging
  for accountability and auditability.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for machine learning pipelines
  in GCP AI Platform. To verify, ensure that the pipeline job configurations include
  logging options that capture necessary events and activities. Remediation involves
  configuring the pipeline jobs to utilize Google's Cloud Logging service, ensuring
  all relevant logs are captured and retained according to your organization's policy.
  This can be done through the AI Platform Console or via API configurations.
