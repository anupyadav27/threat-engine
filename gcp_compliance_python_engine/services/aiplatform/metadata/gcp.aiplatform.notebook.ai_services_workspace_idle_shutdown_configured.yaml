title: Ensure AI Services Workspace Idle Shutdown is Configured
rationale: Configuring idle shutdown for AI Services Workspaces helps optimize resource
  usage and reduce costs by automatically powering down idle resources. This minimizes
  the attack surface by ensuring resources are not left running unnecessarily, which
  could be exploited by attackers. It also supports compliance with cost management
  and operational efficiency standards.
description: This check verifies that AI Services Workspaces in GCP have idle shutdown
  configured. Idle shutdown automatically shuts down workspaces after a specified
  period of inactivity, which can be configured in the GCP Console under the AI Platform
  Notebook settings. To verify, navigate to the AI Platform Notebooks section and
  ensure that the 'Idle Shutdown' option is enabled with an appropriate time limit
  set. Remediation involves enabling this setting and selecting a suitable time interval
  to balance resource availability with security and cost considerations.
