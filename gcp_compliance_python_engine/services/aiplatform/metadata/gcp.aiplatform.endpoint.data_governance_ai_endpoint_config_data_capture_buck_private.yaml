requirement: Data Governance Ai Endpoint Config Data Capture Buck Private

domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Ensure AI Endpoint Data Capture Buckets are Private
rationale: Private data capture buckets help mitigate unauthorized access risks, protecting
  sensitive data processed by AI endpoints. An open bucket can expose sensitive information
  to unintended parties, leading to data breaches and violating compliance with standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform endpoint data capture buckets are configured
  with private access settings. It verifies that these buckets do not allow public
  access, ensuring data is only accessible to authorized users. To remediate, review
  bucket permissions in Google Cloud Storage and ensure that no public grants are
  configured, restricting access to a minimum set of known identities.
