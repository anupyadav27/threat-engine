title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform endpoints ensures that data
  is transmitted over secure, controlled networks, reducing exposure to public internet
  threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access. This is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive data, maintaining customer trust, and meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: "This rule checks whether AI Platform endpoints are configured to use\
  \ private networking, which restricts access to the internal network and avoids\
  \ exposure to the public internet. To verify, ensure that the endpoint's network\
  \ configuration specifies a VPC network and that 'enablePrivateServiceConnect' is\
  \ set to true. Remediation involves updating the endpoint settings to utilize a\
  \ VPC network with private service access enabled, following GCP\u2019s best practices\
  \ for private connectivity."
