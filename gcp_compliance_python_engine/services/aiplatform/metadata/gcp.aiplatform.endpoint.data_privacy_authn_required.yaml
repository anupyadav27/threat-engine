title: Ensure Endpoint Authentication for Data Privacy
rationale: Enforcing authentication for AI Platform endpoints is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive data, which could lead to data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Inadequate authentication can expose endpoints
  to malicious actors, increasing the risk of data theft and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform endpoints require authentication to
  access data, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the endpoint.
  To verify, ensure that IAM roles are correctly assigned and that authentication
  mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0, are in place for accessing endpoints. Remediation
  involves setting up IAM policies that enforce authentication and regularly reviewing
  access logs to detect unauthorized attempts.
