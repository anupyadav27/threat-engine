title: Ensure AI Training Job Volumes Are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting AI training job volumes at rest is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This practice helps mitigate
  risks such as data theft or exposure, especially in scenarios where data is stored
  in shared or multi-tenant environments. Meeting this requirement aligns with compliance
  mandates like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which demand robust data protection and
  privacy measures.
description: This rule checks if encryption is enabled for volumes used in Google
  Cloud AI Platform custom training jobs. Specifically, it verifies that Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) are configured for storage resources to ensure data is encrypted
  with keys managed by the customer. To verify, audit the AI Platform custom job configurations
  for CMEK settings. Remediation involves configuring AI training jobs to specify
  CMEK for volume encryption, ensuring data is secured using keys within your control.
