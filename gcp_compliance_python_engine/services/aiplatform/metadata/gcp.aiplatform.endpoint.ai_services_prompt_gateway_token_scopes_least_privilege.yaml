title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Prompt Gateway Token Scopes
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to AI Platform Prompt Gateway
  token scopes minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data exposure.
  This practice reduces attack surface, ensuring that tokens have only the permissions
  necessary for their function, thereby mitigating the impact of compromised credentials
  and aligning with compliance mandates like NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule verifies that AI Platform endpoints are configured with token
  scopes that adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting the minimal permissions
  required for operation. To ensure compliance, review the IAM policies associated
  with the AI Platform endpoints and adjust scopes to eliminate unnecessary permissions.
  Remediation involves using the GCP Console or CLI to edit IAM roles and scopes for
  the AI Platform endpoints, ensuring they are appropriately restrictive.
