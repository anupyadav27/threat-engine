title: Ensure AI Dataset Lifecycle Policies are Configured
rationale: Configuring lifecycle policies for AI datasets helps reduce the risk of
  unauthorized access and data leakage by ensuring datasets are properly expired,
  archived, or deleted according to compliance and business requirements. This is
  crucial for maintaining data integrity and adhering to regulations such as GDPR
  and CCPA, which mandate data minimization and timely deletion of personal data.
description: This rule checks if lifecycle management policies are set for AI datasets
  in Google Cloud's AI Platform. Lifecycle policies define automatic actions on datasets,
  like deletion or archival, based on conditions such as age or last access time.
  To verify compliance, inspect the dataset configurations in the AI Platform and
  ensure policies are active and align with organizational data retention standards.
  Remediation involves configuring these policies via the Google Cloud Console or
  using the AI Platform's API to enforce dataset management best practices.
