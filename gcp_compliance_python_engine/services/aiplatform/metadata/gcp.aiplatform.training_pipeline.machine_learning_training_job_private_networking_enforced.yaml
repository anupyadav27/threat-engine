title: Enforce Private Networking for ML Training Jobs
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Machine Learning training jobs on GCP
  ensures that communication between AI Platform resources and the training environment
  occurs over a secure, private network. This reduces exposure to external threats
  such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration. It also aids in compliance with
  regulatory standards that mandate secure data handling, such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA,
  by minimizing network attack surfaces.
description: "This rule checks that all Machine Learning training jobs within AI Platform\
  \ Training Pipelines are configured to use private networking. Specifically, it\
  \ verifies that the 'enablePrivateServiceConnect' option is set to true, ensuring\
  \ that traffic stays within Google\u2019s private network. To remediate non-compliant\
  \ resources, configure the training job to use a VPC network by setting the 'network'\
  \ field in the TrainingPipeline configuration. This helps protect sensitive data\
  \ and aligns with best practices for network access control."
