title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in AI Platform Model Registry
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing in the AI Platform Model Registry is
  essential to prevent unauthorized access to machine learning models, which may contain
  sensitive data or proprietary algorithms. Unrestricted sharing can lead to data
  breaches, intellectual property theft, and compliance violations, such as failing
  to adhere to GDPR or CCPA privacy regulations.
description: This rule checks that machine learning models in Google Cloud's AI Platform
  Model Registry are not shared across accounts unless explicitly authorized. To verify,
  review the sharing settings of your AI models to ensure they are not publicly accessible
  or shared with unauthorized accounts. Remediation involves setting appropriate IAM
  policies to limit access to trusted users within the same organization and auditing
  access logs regularly.
