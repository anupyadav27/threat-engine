title: Ensure Critical Vulnerability Scanning for AI Model Artifacts
rationale: Scanning AI model artifacts for critical vulnerabilities is essential to
  prevent the deployment of compromised software which could lead to data breaches
  or unauthorized access. Neglecting this can result in significant business risks,
  including loss of customer trust and potential non-compliance with regulatory standards
  that mandate secure software supply chains.
description: This rule checks whether AI model artifacts in Google Cloud AI Platform
  undergo critical vulnerability scanning to identify and mitigate risks before deployment.
  Ensure that Artifact Registry or Container Analysis is configured to automatically
  scan for vulnerabilities in model artifacts. If critical vulnerabilities are found,
  remediation involves updating the artifact with a secure version or applying security
  patches. Regular monitoring and scanning are crucial to maintain a robust security
  posture.
