title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Platform Training Pipelines
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform training pipelines mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure by restricting network traffic
  to a secure VPC. This reduces the threat surface for potential attackers and complies
  with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data
  protection measures.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform training pipelines are configured
  to use private networking, which ensures data is transmitted over a secure, internal
  network rather than the public internet. To verify, ensure the training pipeline's
  networking configuration specifies a VPC network. Remediation involves updating
  the training pipeline configuration to include a VPC network, ensuring all data
  traffic remains within Google Cloud's secure infrastructure.
