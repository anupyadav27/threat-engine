service: aiplatform
resource: dataset
requirement: Ai Services Dataset Cloud Storage Encrypted At Rest
scope: aiplatform.dataset.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Datasets are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting AI Platform datasets at rest protects sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and breaches, mitigating risks such as data leaks and financial loss. It
  aligns with compliance standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate encryption
  of sensitive data to safeguard customer information and maintain trust.
description: "This rule checks that AI Platform datasets stored in Cloud Storage are\
  \ encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. Verify\
  \ encryption settings by inspecting the dataset\u2019s storage configuration in\
  \ the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud CLI. To remediate, enable encryption\
  \ in the Cloud Storage settings for the dataset, ensuring that default or custom\
  \ encryption keys are applied."
