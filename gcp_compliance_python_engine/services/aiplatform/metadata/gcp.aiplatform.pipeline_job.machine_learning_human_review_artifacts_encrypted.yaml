scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Encrypt Human Review Artifacts in AI Platform Pipelines
rationale: Encrypting human review artifacts in AI Platform pipelines is crucial to
  protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This ensures
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  encryption of data at rest. Failure to encrypt can lead to data exposure, resulting
  in legal penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that machine learning human review artifacts generated
  by AI Platform pipeline jobs are encrypted using Customer Managed Encryption Keys
  (CMEK). To ensure compliance, configure the pipeline job to use a CMEK by specifying
  the `encryptionSpec` field in the job's configuration. Validate the setup by checking
  the job's metadata in the Cloud Console or using gcloud CLI. Remediate by updating
  pipeline configurations to include a valid CMEK.
