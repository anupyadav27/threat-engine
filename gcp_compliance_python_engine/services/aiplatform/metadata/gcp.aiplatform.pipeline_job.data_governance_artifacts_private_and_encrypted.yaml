requirement: Data Governance Artifacts Private And Encrypted
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Pipeline Job Artifacts are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting and restricting access to AI Platform Pipeline Job artifacts
  helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially in
  industries with strict data protection regulations like healthcare and finance.
  Non-compliance can lead to reputational damage and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform Pipeline Job artifacts are stored in
  private and encrypted storage buckets. Verify that the Google Cloud Storage buckets
  used for storing pipeline job outputs have Bucket Policy Only or Uniform Bucket-Level
  Access enabled, and that they use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encryption.
  Remediation involves configuring the storage bucket settings to ensure private access
  and enabling CMEK for encryption.
