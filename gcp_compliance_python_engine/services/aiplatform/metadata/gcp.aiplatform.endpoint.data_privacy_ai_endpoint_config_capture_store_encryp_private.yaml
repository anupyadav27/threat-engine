domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Ensure AI Endpoint Config Capture Data is Encrypted Privately
rationale: Encrypting data captured by AI endpoints ensures the confidentiality and
  integrity of sensitive information, mitigating risks such as unauthorized access
  and data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining trust with stakeholders and complying
  with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict controls
  over personal data handling and storage.
description: This rule checks if the AI Platform endpoint is configured to encrypt
  captured data using private keys. Ensuring that data is encrypted with private keys
  enhances security by preventing exposure to unauthorized entities. Verify that the
  endpoint's data capture configuration specifies encryption settings using customer-managed
  keys (CMKs) within Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Remediate by updating the
  endpoint configuration to use CMKs, thereby applying robust encryption standards.
