scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure ML Human Review UI Uses Private Networking
rationale: Enforcing private networking for the Machine Learning Human Review UI mitigates
  potential data breaches by restricting network access to authorized and internal
  networks only. This reduces exposure to the public internet, thereby protecting
  sensitive machine learning data and models from unauthorized access and tampering.
  It also helps meet compliance requirements for data protection and privacy standards,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring secure data transmission within a controlled
  environment.
description: This rule checks if the Machine Learning Human Review UI for AI Platform
  pipeline jobs is configured to use private networking. To verify, ensure that the
  UI is accessed through a VPC Service Control perimeter, blocking access from public
  IP addresses. Remediation involves configuring private Google Access and setting
  up appropriate firewall rules within the VPC to allow only necessary internal traffic.
  This enhances security by ensuring that sensitive machine learning operations are
  conducted over a secure and private network.
