title: Ensure AI Platform Experiments Use Least Privilege Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Platform experiments is critical to
  minimize the risk of unauthorized data access, which could lead to data breaches,
  financial loss, and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Proper
  RBAC configurations help prevent privilege escalation attacks and ensure that users
  have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, reducing the attack
  surface.
description: This rule checks for the correct configuration of Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) on AI Platform experiment resources to enforce the principle of least privilege.
  It ensures that users have the minimal set of permissions required to manage experiments
  without unnecessary access to sensitive data. Verify by auditing IAM roles assigned
  to users and service accounts associated with AI Platform experiments, ensuring
  they align with their job functions. Remediate by adjusting roles to more restrictive
  ones, removing excessive permissions, and regularly reviewing permissions for ongoing
  appropriateness.
