title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Model Execution Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI model execution roles minimizes the
  attack surface and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  Over-privileged roles can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, which mandate strict access controls
  to protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether AI model execution roles in Google Cloud's AI
  Platform are configured with the minimum necessary permissions. It verifies the
  role assignments to ensure they do not exceed the required permissions for executing
  AI models. Remediation involves auditing current role permissions, removing unnecessary
  access, and adhering strictly to the least privilege principle. To verify, review
  the IAM policy bindings for AI models and adjust roles using the GCP Console or
  gcloud CLI to ensure they are limited to execution-related permissions only.
