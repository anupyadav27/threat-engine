title: Ensure AI Platform Models Use Encrypted Data Governance Packages
rationale: Encrypting data governance packages for AI Platform models is crucial to
  protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and data breaches. This practice
  mitigates risks associated with data leakage and ensures compliance with data protection
  regulations like GDPR and CCPA, reducing potential legal and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks if the data governance packages for AI Platform models
  are encrypted using Google Cloud's Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To verify
  compliance, ensure that the AI Platform model resources specify an encryption key
  from Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Remediation involves setting up a CMEK
  in Cloud KMS and configuring the model to use this key during deployment.
