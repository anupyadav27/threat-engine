title: Enable Rate Limiting for AI Platform Endpoint Services
rationale: Enabling rate limiting on AI Platform endpoints helps prevent abuse and
  denial of service attacks, which can lead to service disruption and increased costs.
  Proper rate limiting ensures that AI services are available to legitimate users
  while mitigating risks of resource exhaustion and maintaining compliance with organizational
  security policies.
description: This rule verifies that rate limiting is configured for AI Platform endpoint
  services, ensuring that the number of requests per user or IP is controlled. To
  enable rate limiting, configure API quotas and request limits in the Google Cloud
  Console under AI Platform settings. Regularly review and adjust these limits based
  on usage patterns to ensure optimal performance and security.
