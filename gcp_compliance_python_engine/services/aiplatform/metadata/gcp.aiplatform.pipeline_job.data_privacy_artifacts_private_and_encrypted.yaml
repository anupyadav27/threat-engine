resource: pipeline_job
requirement: Data Privacy Artifacts Private And Encrypted
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Pipeline Data is Private and Encrypted
rationale: Data privacy is critical for protecting sensitive information processed
  by AI Platform pipelines. Unencrypted data artifacts can be exposed to unauthorized
  access, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. Ensuring data privacy and encryption mitigates risks of data leakage
  and supports maintaining trust and regulatory adherence.
description: This rule verifies that artifacts created by AI Platform pipeline jobs
  are stored privately and encrypted at rest. Ensure that all output artifacts are
  stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets with bucket policies enforcing encryption,
  such as Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). Verify encryption settings through
  the Google Cloud Console or CLI, and apply necessary policies to restrict access
  and enforce encryption standards.
