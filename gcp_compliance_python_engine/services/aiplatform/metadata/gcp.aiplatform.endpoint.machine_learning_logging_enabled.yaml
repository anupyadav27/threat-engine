subcategory: audit_logging
severity: medium
title: Enable Logging for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling logging for AI Platform endpoints provides visibility into operations
  and potential misuse by capturing audit trails of requests and responses. This is
  essential for detecting anomalies, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection and the ability
  to audit data access and processing.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for endpoints within the AI Platform,
  ensuring that all interactions with machine learning models are recorded. To verify
  and enable logging, ensure that audit logging is configured in the Google Cloud
  Console under the AI Platform section. Remediation involves enabling 'Admin Activity'
  and 'Data Access' logs to capture detailed operational insights.
