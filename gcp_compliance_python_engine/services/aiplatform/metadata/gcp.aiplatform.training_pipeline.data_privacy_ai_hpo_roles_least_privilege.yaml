title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Training Pipeline Roles
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to AI Platform roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations, reducing potential
  data breaches and violations of compliance standards. This approach helps maintain
  data privacy, especially when handling sensitive datasets in training pipelines,
  aligning with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to users and service accounts for
  managing AI Platform training pipelines are configured with the least privilege
  principle. Verify that users only have permissions necessary for their tasks, avoiding
  roles with excessive access like 'Owner'. Remediate by auditing current role assignments
  and adjusting permissions to adhere strictly to required operations, using predefined
  roles such as 'AI Platform Viewer' or custom roles with minimum necessary permissions.
