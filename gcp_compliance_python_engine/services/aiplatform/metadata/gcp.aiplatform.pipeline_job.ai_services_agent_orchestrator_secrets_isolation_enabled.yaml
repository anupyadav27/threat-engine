title: Ensure AI Services Agent Orchestrator Secrets Isolation
rationale: Isolating orchestrator secrets in AI Platform ensures that sensitive credentials
  and keys are not inadvertently exposed or misused, mitigating the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This practice is crucial for maintaining the
  confidentiality and integrity of operations, especially in environments where multiple
  AI models and pipelines are managed. It also aligns with compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate stringent controls on sensitive data handling.
description: This rule checks if AI Services Agent Orchestrator secrets are isolated
  in AI Platform Pipeline Jobs by verifying specific configuration settings that separate
  and protect sensitive information. To enable secrets isolation, users must configure
  their pipeline jobs to use dedicated secret management tools, such as Secret Manager,
  and ensure that secrets are not hardcoded or stored in plaintext. Remediation involves
  auditing existing pipeline configurations, updating them to utilize secure secret
  storage, and enforcing access controls. Verification can be performed by reviewing
  pipeline job configurations for compliance with these practices.
