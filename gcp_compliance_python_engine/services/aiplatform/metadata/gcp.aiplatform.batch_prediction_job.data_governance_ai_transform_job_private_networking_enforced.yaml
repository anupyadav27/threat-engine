title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Platform Batch Prediction Jobs
rationale: Ensuring that AI Platform batch prediction jobs use private networking
  is crucial to limit exposure to the public internet, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized access. This measure helps protect sensitive data processed during
  AI transformations, aligning with compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA that
  require stringent data protection controls.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform batch prediction jobs are configured
  to use private networking, which restricts network access to internal IP addresses
  only. Verify the configuration by ensuring that 'network' attribute specifies a
  VPC with private IPs. Remediation involves configuring batch jobs to run within
  a VPC network, using private IP settings, to ensure secure, internal data flow and
  connectivity.
