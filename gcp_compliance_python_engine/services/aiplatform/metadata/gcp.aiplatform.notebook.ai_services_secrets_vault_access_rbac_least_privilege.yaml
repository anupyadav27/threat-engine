resource: notebook
requirement: Ai Services Secrets Vault Access RBAC Least Privilege
scope: aiplatform.notebook.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Notebook Vault Access in AI Platform
rationale: Implementing least privilege for access to AI Services Secrets Vault ensures
  that only authorized users and services can access sensitive secrets, minimizing
  the risk of data breaches. This control is critical for protecting intellectual
  property and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR,
  HIPAA, and others, as unauthorized access could lead to significant financial and
  reputational harm.
description: This rule verifies that access to the AI Services Secrets Vault from
  AI Platform notebooks is restricted to only those roles and identities that absolutely
  require it. Users should configure Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to
  grant the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended functions. To
  comply, audit current access policies using the GCP Console or CLI, ensuring that
  only essential service accounts and users have roles such as 'Secret Manager Secret
  Accessor'. Revoke any unnecessary permissions immediately.
