severity: high
title: Enable KMS Encryption for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI Platform pipeline jobs is crucial to protect
  sensitive data processed and stored by AI models. This reduces the risk of data
  breaches by ensuring that data is encrypted at rest using customer-managed keys.
  It helps organizations meet compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring
  that sensitive information remains secure and under the control of the organization.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform pipeline jobs are configured to
  use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) with Google Cloud Key Management Service
  (KMS). To verify, ensure that the `kmsKeyName` attribute is set in the pipeline
  job configuration. To remediate, update the pipeline job definition to include a
  valid KMS key name, ensuring that the key is properly granted permissions to the
  AI Platform service account for encryption and decryption operations.
