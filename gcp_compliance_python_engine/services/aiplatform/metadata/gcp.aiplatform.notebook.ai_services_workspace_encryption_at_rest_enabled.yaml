subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure AI Notebook Workspace Encryption at Rest is Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for AI Notebook workspaces protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  confidentiality and integrity, especially in environments where sensitive or proprietary
  data is processed, supporting compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether encryption at rest is enabled for AI Notebook
  workspaces within Google Cloud's AI Platform. The configuration ensures that all
  data stored within the workspace is encrypted using Google-managed encryption keys.
  To verify, navigate to the AI Platform Notebooks in the GCP Console and ensure encryption
  settings are configured. If not enabled, update the notebook instance settings to
  use encryption at rest, leveraging Google-managed keys or customer-managed keys
  for enhanced security.
