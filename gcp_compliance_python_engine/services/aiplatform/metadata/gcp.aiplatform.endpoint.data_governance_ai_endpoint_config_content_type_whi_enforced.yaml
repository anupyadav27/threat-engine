title: Ensure AI Endpoint Config Content Type Whitelisting Enforced
rationale: Enforcing content type whitelisting for AI endpoints mitigates the risk
  of data breaches and unauthorized data processing. This practice is essential for
  maintaining data integrity and privacy, especially in environments dealing with
  sensitive or regulated data. Failure to enforce such controls can lead to non-compliance
  with data protection regulations and potential exposure to legal and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints have content type whitelisting
  enforced, ensuring that only approved data types are processed. To verify, inspect
  the endpoint configuration settings in the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud
  command-line tool to ensure the 'contentTypes' field specifies allowed content types.
  Remediation involves updating the endpoint configurations to include a whitelist
  of authorized content types, preventing unauthorized data formats from being processed.
