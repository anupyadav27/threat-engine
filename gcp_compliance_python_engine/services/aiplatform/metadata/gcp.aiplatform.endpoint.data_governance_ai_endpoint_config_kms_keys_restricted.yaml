service: aiplatform
resource: endpoint
requirement: Data Governance Ai Endpoint Config KMS Keys Restricted
scope: aiplatform.endpoint.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Restrict AI Endpoint Config to Specific KMS Keys
rationale: Limiting AI endpoint configurations to specific KMS keys reduces the risk
  of unauthorized data access and breaches by ensuring that only approved encryption
  keys are used. This enhances data protection against threats such as data exfiltration
  and unauthorized decryption while maintaining compliance with regulations like GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that only designated Cloud KMS keys are used for encrypting
  data at rest for AI Platform endpoints. To verify, inspect the AI Platform endpoint
  configurations for compliance with approved KMS key policies. Remediation involves
  updating endpoint configurations to ensure only specific KMS key versions are used,
  which can be done via the Google Cloud Console or CLI by setting the 'kmsKeyName'
  parameter correctly.
