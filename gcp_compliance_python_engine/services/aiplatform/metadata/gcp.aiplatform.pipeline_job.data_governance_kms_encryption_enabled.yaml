subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure KMS Encryption for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI Platform pipeline jobs protects sensitive
  data by encrypting it at rest using a customer-managed key. This reduces the risk
  of unauthorized data access and helps meet compliance requirements for data protection
  standards such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR. It ensures that only authorized users
  with access to the encryption key can decrypt the data, mitigating potential data
  breaches.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform pipeline jobs are configured to
  use Cloud KMS customer-managed keys for data encryption at rest. To verify, ensure
  the pipeline job configuration includes an 'encryptionSpec' with a specified 'kmsKeyName'.
  If not configured, update the pipeline job settings to include a valid KMS key from
  your Cloud KMS service. This enhances data security by leveraging encryption best
  practices.
