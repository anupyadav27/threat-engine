domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Encryption of AI Training Job Input/Output in GCP
rationale: "Encrypting the input and output data of AI training jobs is crucial for\
  \ protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance\
  \ with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This reduces the risk of\
  \ data breaches and supports the organization\u2019s commitment to maintaining customer\
  \ trust and safeguarding intellectual property."
description: This rule checks whether input and output data for AI Platform Custom
  Jobs are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). It involves verifying
  that the encryption configuration is set in the AI Platform job settings. To remediate,
  ensure that the AI Platform job configuration specifies a CMEK for data encryption,
  thereby enhancing data protection by using keys managed by the organization.
