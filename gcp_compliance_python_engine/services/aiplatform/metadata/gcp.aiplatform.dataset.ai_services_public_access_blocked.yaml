title: Block Public Access to AI Platform Datasets
rationale: Blocking public access to AI Platform datasets is critical to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive data, which could lead to data breaches or intellectual property
  theft. Exposing datasets publicly increases the risk of data leakage and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict data protection measures.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform datasets are not publicly accessible
  by ensuring that IAM policies deny public access. To verify, inspect the dataset's
  IAM policy and ensure that 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' are not granted
  roles that provide read access. Remediation involves updating IAM policies to restrict
  access to only authorized users and groups, reducing the risk of unauthorized data
  exposure.
