title: Ensure No Plaintext Secrets in AI Platform Notebook Configurations
rationale: Storing plaintext secrets in AI Platform notebooks poses a significant
  security risk by potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access. This
  can lead to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and non-compliance with
  regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, which mandate the protection
  of sensitive information. Ensuring secrets are stored securely mitigates these risks
  and upholds data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks for the presence of plaintext secrets in the configuration
  of AI Platform notebooks, ensuring that all secrets are stored securely using a
  dedicated secret management service such as Google Cloud Secret Manager. To verify
  compliance, inspect notebook configurations for hardcoded secrets and replace them
  with references to the secret management solution. Remediation involves migrating
  any plaintext secrets found to the secret manager and updating the notebook configuration
  to access secrets programmatically.
