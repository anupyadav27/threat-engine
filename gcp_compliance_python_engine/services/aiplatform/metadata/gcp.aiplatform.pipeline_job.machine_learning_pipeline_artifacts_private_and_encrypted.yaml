service: aiplatform
resource: pipeline_job
requirement: Machine Learning Pipeline Artifacts Private And Encrypted
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure ML Pipeline Artifacts Are Private and Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting machine learning pipeline artifacts at rest ensures data confidentiality
  and integrity, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This
  is crucial for maintaining trust with stakeholders, meeting compliance requirements
  (such as GDPR and HIPAA), and protecting sensitive intellectual property or personal
  data involved in machine learning processes.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform pipeline artifacts are stored with encryption
  at rest and access is restricted to authorized users only. Ensure that encryption
  keys are managed securely using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) and access
  is controlled via IAM roles with least privilege. Verify encryption settings in
  AI Platform's pipeline job configurations and update policies to enforce encryption
  and privacy controls across all artifacts.
