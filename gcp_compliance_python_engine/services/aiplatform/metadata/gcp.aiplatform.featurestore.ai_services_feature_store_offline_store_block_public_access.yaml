resource: featurestore
requirement: Ai Services Feature Store Offline Store Block Public Access
scope: aiplatform.featurestore.public_access
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Restrict Public Access to AI Feature Store Offline Data
rationale: Public access to AI Feature Store Offline Store can expose sensitive ML
  data, leading to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Ensuring data is only accessible to authorized
  users mitigates risks of unauthorized data manipulation and leakage.
description: This rule checks that the AI Feature Store Offline Store is configured
  to block public access. Verify that access policies are set to deny access from
  'allUsers' and 'allAuthenticatedUsers'. To remediate, update IAM policies to restrict
  access to specific service accounts or user groups. Use Google Cloud Console or
  gcloud CLI to modify IAM settings, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact
  with the offline data.
