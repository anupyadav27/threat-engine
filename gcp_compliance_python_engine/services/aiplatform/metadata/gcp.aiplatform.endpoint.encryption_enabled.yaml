requirement: Encryption Enabled

severity: high
title: Ensure Encryption is Enabled for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling encryption for AI Platform endpoints protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead to significant financial losses
  and reputational damage. Encryption at rest is critical for meeting compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA that mandate the protection of personal
  data stored in cloud environments.
description: This rule checks if encryption is enabled for AI Platform endpoints to
  safeguard data at rest. Verify that each AI Platform endpoint has Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) configured, which allows for greater control over cryptographic
  keys and data protection. Remediation involves setting up CMEK in Google Cloud Key
  Management Service (KMS) and applying it to your AI Platform endpoints through the
  Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI.
