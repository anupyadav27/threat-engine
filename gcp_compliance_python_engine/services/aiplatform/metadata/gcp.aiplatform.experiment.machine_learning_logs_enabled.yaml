title: Ensure Machine Learning Logs are Enabled for AI Platform Experiments
rationale: Enabling machine learning logs is crucial for monitoring and auditing the
  activity within AI Platform experiments. This provides visibility into model training
  processes and data handling, which is essential for detecting anomalies, ensuring
  data integrity, and meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and SOC2. Without
  logging, organizations risk undetected data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory
  standards, potentially leading to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for machine learning experiments
  in Google Cloud's AI Platform. To verify, ensure that the AI Platform's logging
  configurations are correctly set to capture detailed logs of model training and
  data processing activities. Remediation involves configuring the logging settings
  within the AI Platform to ensure comprehensive log collection, which can be done
  via the Google Cloud Console or by using the gcloud command-line tool. This facilitates
  effective monitoring and auditing of AI workloads.
