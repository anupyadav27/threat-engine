title: Enforce Private Networking for Automl Training Pipelines
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Machine Learning AutoML training pipelines
  minimizes exposure to public internet threats, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized access. This measure supports compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring sensitive data remains within the controlled
  environment of the Google Cloud Platform. It also enhances the overall security
  posture by limiting attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks if the AutoML training pipelines in GCP's AI Platform
  are configured to use private networking, which means they communicate over a Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) instead of the public internet. Ensure that the 'enablePrivateServiceConnect'
  option is set to true in the training pipeline configuration. Verify this setting
  via the Google Cloud Console or by using the gcloud CLI. To remediate, update existing
  pipelines to enforce private networking by modifying the network configuration to
  include a private connection.
