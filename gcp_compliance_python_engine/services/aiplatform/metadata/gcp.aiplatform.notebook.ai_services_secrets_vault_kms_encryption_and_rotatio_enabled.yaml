title: Enable KMS Encryption & Rotation for AI Notebook Secrets
rationale: Using Cloud KMS for encrypting secrets in AI Platform notebooks enhances
  data security by protecting sensitive information against unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. Regular key rotation further mitigates risks by ensuring
  that encryption keys are periodically changed, aligning with compliance standards
  like NIST and PCI-DSS, and thereby reducing the risk of key compromise.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform notebook instances use Cloud KMS for
  encrypting secrets stored in the AI Services Secrets Vault and if key rotation is
  enabled. Verify that the notebooks have KMS keys configured for encryption, and
  key rotation periods are set in accordance with security policies. To remediate,
  configure AI Platform notebooks to use KMS keys by navigating to the notebook instance
  settings and specifying a KMS key, ensuring that automatic key rotation is enabled
  in the Cloud KMS settings.
