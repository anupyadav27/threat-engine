service: aiplatform
resource: pipeline_job
requirement: Ai Services Agent Orchestrator Data Exfiltration Po Enforced
scope: aiplatform.pipeline_job.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Services Agent Orchestrator Prevents Data Exfiltration
rationale: Preventing data exfiltration in AI services is crucial to protect sensitive
  data and comply with data protection regulations. Uncontrolled data flow can lead
  to unauthorized data access, violating privacy laws such as GDPR and impacting organizational
  reputation and trust.
description: This rule checks if the AI Services Agent Orchestrator within AI Platform
  Pipeline Jobs is configured to prevent data exfiltration. Ensure the orchestration
  policies enforce data encryption and restrict network access to authorized endpoints
  only. Verify compliance by reviewing the pipeline job's configuration in the GCP
  console and apply necessary IAM policies and VPC Service Controls to mitigate exfiltration
  risks.
