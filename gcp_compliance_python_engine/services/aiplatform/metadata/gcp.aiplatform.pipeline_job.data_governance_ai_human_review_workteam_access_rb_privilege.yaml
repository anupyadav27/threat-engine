title: Restrict Human Review Workteam Access in AI Platform Pipelines
rationale: Ensuring least privilege access for AI human review workteams is critical
  to prevent unauthorized data exposure and maintain compliance with data protection
  regulations. Improper access controls can lead to data breaches, impacting both
  business reputation and customer trust. Adhering to access control best practices
  mitigates the risk of insider threats and aligns with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform's pipeline job configurations grant only
  necessary privileges to human review workteams. It verifies that access roles are
  restricted to the minimum required for task execution, reducing the risk of data
  leakage. To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies to ensure users have the least
  privilege necessary for their roles. Regular access reviews and audits should also
  be conducted to maintain compliance.
