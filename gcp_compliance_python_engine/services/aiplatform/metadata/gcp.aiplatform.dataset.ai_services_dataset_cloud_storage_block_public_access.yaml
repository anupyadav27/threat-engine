title: Block Public Access to AI Platform Datasets in Cloud Storage
rationale: Allowing public access to AI Platform datasets can expose sensitive data
  and intellectual property to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance
  violations. This exposure can also result in financial and reputational damage,
  especially when handling regulated data under standards like GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that public access is blocked for datasets stored
  in Google Cloud Storage used by AI Platform services. To ensure compliance, check
  the bucket's IAM policy to confirm that no public access permissions are granted.
  Remediation involves removing 'allUsers' and 'allAuthenticatedUsers' roles from
  the bucket's permissions, and configuring appropriate IAM roles for authorized users
  only.
