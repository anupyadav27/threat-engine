severity: low
title: Ensure Authn for AI Services Vector Index in Featurestore
rationale: Requiring authentication for accessing AI Services Vector Index prevents
  unauthorized access to sensitive data and models, mitigating risks such as data
  leakage and unauthorized data manipulation. This is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and compliance with regulations like GDPR, which mandates strict access
  controls on personal data. Ensuring authentication helps organizations protect intellectual
  property and maintain trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule checks that authentication is required when accessing the AI
  Services Vector Index within a Featurestore in GCP's AI Platform. It verifies whether
  proper authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 or service account tokens, are
  enforced. To remediate, configure the Featurestore to require authentication by
  setting appropriate IAM policies and ensuring all accessing services and users have
  the necessary credentials. Regularly audit access logs to ensure compliance and
  adjust access controls as necessary.
