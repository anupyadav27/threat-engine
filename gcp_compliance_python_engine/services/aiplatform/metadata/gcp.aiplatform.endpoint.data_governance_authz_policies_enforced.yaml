title: Ensure Data Governance Policies on AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing data governance authorization policies on AI Platform endpoints
  is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and adhering to regulatory requirements.
  Without proper authorization controls, unauthorized access could lead to data breaches,
  financial losses, and non-compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing
  these controls helps maintain data integrity, confidentiality, and ensures that
  only authorized personnel have access to critical data assets.
description: This rule checks whether data governance authorization policies are enforced
  on AI Platform endpoints, ensuring that appropriate identity and access management
  (IAM) policies are in place. To verify compliance, review the IAM policies associated
  with AI Platform endpoints and confirm that access is restricted to authorized users
  and service accounts. Remediation involves applying least privilege principles,
  updating IAM policies to enforce strict access controls, and regularly auditing
  access logs to detect unauthorized access attempts.
