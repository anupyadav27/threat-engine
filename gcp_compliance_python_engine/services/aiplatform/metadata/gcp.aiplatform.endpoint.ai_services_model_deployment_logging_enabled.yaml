title: Enable Model Deployment Logging for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Logging for AI model deployments on GCP AI Platform is crucial for tracking
  changes, diagnosing issues, and ensuring compliance with internal and external regulations.
  Without proper logging, organizations may be unable to detect unauthorized access,
  troubleshoot deployment failures, or meet audit requirements, potentially leading
  to data breaches or regulatory fines.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for AI model deployments
  on AI Platform endpoints. It verifies that all interactions and changes to model
  deployments are captured in Google Cloud Logging. To enable logging, ensure that
  the AI Platform's endpoint logging settings are correctly configured in the GCP
  Console or via the gcloud command line tool. Remediation involves setting up and
  verifying the logging configuration to align with organizational policies and compliance
  mandates.
