title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Notebooks
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Services notebooks reduces the attack
  surface by preventing exposure to the public internet. This minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized access, data breaches, and ensures compliance with regulations that
  mandate secure data handling, such as HIPAA and GDPR. It is crucial for protecting
  sensitive machine learning models and data.
description: This rule checks if AI Services notebooks are configured to use private
  networking, ensuring that they are only accessible within a VPC. To verify, ensure
  that the notebooks have the 'network' attribute set to a valid VPC network. Remediation
  involves updating the notebook configuration to specify a private VPC network, which
  can be done through the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI. This configuration enhances
  security by limiting access to internal IPs only.
