domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for ML Training Job Roles
rationale: Utilizing least privilege access for machine learning training jobs minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It is crucial for maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity, especially when handling sensitive data within
  AI models. Adhering to this principle supports compliance with regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, and helps prevent privilege escalation attacks.
description: This rule verifies that roles assigned to AI Platform training jobs have
  the minimum necessary permissions. Review IAM policies associated with training
  pipelines to ensure roles are limited to only essential actions. Remediation involves
  auditing current permissions, using predefined roles where possible, and removing
  unnecessary access rights. Implementing these changes can be verified through IAM
  policy reviews in the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud CLI commands.
