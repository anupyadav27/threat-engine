title: Ensure AI Models Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
rationale: Utilizing Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMKs) for AI models ensures
  that sensitive data used in AI processing is protected and under the control of
  your organization. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches
  by providing granular control over encryption keys and meeting regulatory requirements
  for data protection, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that AI models in Google Cloud AI Platform are encrypted
  using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMKs) instead of Google-managed keys. To
  ensure compliance, check that all AI models are configured to use a KMS CMK by specifying
  the 'kmsKeyName' during model deployment. Remediate by updating model configurations
  to use a CMK, which can be done via the GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool.
