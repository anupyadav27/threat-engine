title: Enable KMS Encryption for AI Platform Inference Endpoints
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI Platform inference endpoints ensures that
  sensitive data processed by AI models is protected at rest. This minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized data access and exposure, which is critical for maintaining customer
  trust, complying with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, and mitigating
  potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform inference endpoints are configured to
  use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) with Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)
  for data encryption at rest. Verify that the `encryptionSpec` field is set with
  the correct KMS key resource ID in the endpoint configuration. Remediate by specifying
  a KMS key when creating or updating an endpoint using the AI Platform console, gcloud
  command-line tool, or API, ensuring that all sensitive data processed by the endpoints
  is encrypted with customer-managed keys.
