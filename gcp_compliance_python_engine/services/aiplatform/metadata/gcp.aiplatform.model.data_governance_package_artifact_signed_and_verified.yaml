title: Ensure AI Model Artifacts Are Signed and Verified
rationale: Signing and verifying AI model artifacts is crucial to ensure the integrity
  and authenticity of the models being deployed. Unsigned or improperly verified artifacts
  pose risks such as model tampering, which can lead to incorrect predictions, data
  leaks, or unauthorized access. Compliance with data protection regulations like
  GDPR and industry standards necessitates proper data governance and artifact management.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform model artifacts are signed and verified
  before deployment. To achieve this, configure your models to include a digital signature
  using a secure key management system. Verify these signatures upon deployment to
  ensure they have not been altered. Remediation involves implementing artifact signing
  processes and using Cloud KMS for secure key management. Regular audits should be
  conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.
