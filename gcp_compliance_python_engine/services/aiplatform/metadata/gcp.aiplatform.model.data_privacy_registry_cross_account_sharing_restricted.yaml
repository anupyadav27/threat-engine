title: Restrict AI Model Cross-Account Sharing for Data Privacy
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of AI models is crucial for maintaining
  data privacy and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This control
  mitigates risks such as data breaches and intellectual property theft, which can
  lead to significant financial and reputational damage. Ensuring compliance with
  privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA is essential to avoid legal penalties and
  maintain trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule checks whether AI model resources in Google Cloud's AI Platform
  are configured to prevent cross-account sharing. It ensures that models are not
  shared with accounts outside the designated organization without explicit authorization.
  To verify, review the sharing settings of AI models and ensure they are not accessible
  to unauthorized external accounts. Remediation involves adjusting IAM policies to
  restrict model access to trusted accounts only.
