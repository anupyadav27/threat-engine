title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in AI Platform Models
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of AI models in GCP mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive data and
  intellectual property. This practice is crucial to maintaining data privacy and
  meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent data
  protection measures.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform models are configured to prevent cross-account
  sharing, ensuring that access is limited to authorized accounts only. To verify,
  review the IAM policies associated with the AI model and ensure no permissions allow
  cross-account access. Remediation involves updating IAM policies to restrict sharing
  to within the organization or specific trusted accounts only.
