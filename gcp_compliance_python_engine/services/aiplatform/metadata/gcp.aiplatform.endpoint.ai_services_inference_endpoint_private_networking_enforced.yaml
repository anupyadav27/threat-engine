title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Inference Endpoints
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI inference endpoints mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access and data exfiltration by restricting network access to internal
  resources. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of
  AI services, ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to the public internet,
  which could lead to data breaches or compliance violations with standards like ISO
  27001 and GDPR.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform inference endpoints are configured to
  use private networking, which means they can only be accessed from within the organization's
  VPC network. To verify, ensure that the `network` field is specified in the endpoint
  configuration. Remediation involves updating the endpoint to include a private network
  setting, ensuring it aligns with internal security policies and access controls.
