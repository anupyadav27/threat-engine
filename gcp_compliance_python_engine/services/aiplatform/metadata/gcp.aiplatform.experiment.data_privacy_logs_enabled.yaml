title: Enable Data Privacy Logging for AI Platform Experiments
rationale: Enabling data privacy logs for AI Platform experiments is crucial to monitor
  and audit data interactions, ensuring data integrity and compliance with privacy
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Without logging, organizations face increased
  risk of unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, and non-compliance penalties.
description: This rule checks that data privacy logs are enabled for AI Platform experiments.
  To verify, ensure that logging is configured in the AI Platform settings to capture
  data access and usage details. Remediation involves updating the experiment configurations
  to enable comprehensive logging, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console
  or CLI by setting the appropriate logging parameters.
