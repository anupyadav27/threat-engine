title: Restrict Access to AI Platform Inference Endpoints
rationale: Restricting access to AI Platform inference endpoints minimizes exposure
  to unauthorized data access and reduces the risk of malicious activities such as
  data exfiltration or inference tampering. Ensuring endpoints are only accessible
  from trusted sources can help meet compliance requirements for data protection regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA, while also supporting business continuity by safeguarding AI
  models against potential security threats.
description: This rule checks if the AI Platform inference endpoints have been configured
  with restrictive access controls, such as using VPC Service Controls or IAM roles
  to limit access. Verify that only necessary and authorized entities can reach these
  endpoints by reviewing IAM policies and network settings. To remediate, implement
  network security policies that restrict access to trusted IPs and configure IAM
  roles with the principle of least privilege to manage endpoint access.
