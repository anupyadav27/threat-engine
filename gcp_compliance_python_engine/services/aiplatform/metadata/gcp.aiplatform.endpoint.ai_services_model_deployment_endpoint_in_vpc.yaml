title: Ensure AI Model Endpoints are Deployed within VPC Network
rationale: Deploying AI model endpoints within a VPC enhances security by restricting
  exposure to the public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This configuration helps comply with industry standards and regulations
  that require strict network access control, thereby protecting sensitive data processed
  by AI models.
description: This rule checks whether AI model endpoints on Google Cloud are deployed
  within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. To verify, ensure that the endpoint's
  network configuration specifies a VPC. Remediation involves configuring the AI Platform
  endpoint to use a VPC network, which can be done via the Cloud Console or gcloud
  CLI, ensuring all communications occur within a controlled network environment.
