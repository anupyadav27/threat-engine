title: Enable Audit Logs for AutoML Training Pipelines
rationale: Enabling audit logs for AutoML training pipelines is crucial for tracking
  access and modifications to machine learning resources, which helps prevent unauthorized
  actions and ensures data integrity. This logging capability supports forensic investigations
  by providing a detailed record of operations, which is essential for compliance
  with data protection regulations and maintaining accountability in AI operations.
description: This rule checks if audit logs are enabled for AutoML training pipelines
  in Google Cloud AI Platform. Specifically, it verifies that all read, write, and
  administrative access logs are captured and stored in Cloud Logging. To enable logging,
  ensure that the AI Platform service account has the appropriate roles to access
  Logging, and configure the logging level in the AI Platform settings. Compliance
  can be verified by reviewing the 'Audit Logs' section under IAM & Admin in the GCP
  Console and ensuring logs are being generated for all relevant pipeline activities.
