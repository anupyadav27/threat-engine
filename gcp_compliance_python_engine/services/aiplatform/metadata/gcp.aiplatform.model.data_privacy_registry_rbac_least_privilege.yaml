rule_id: gcp.aiplatform.model.data_privacy_registry_rbac_least_privilege
service: aiplatform
resource: model
requirement: Data Privacy Registry RBAC Least Privilege
scope: aiplatform.model.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure AI Model RBAC Follows Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Applying the least privilege principle to AI model access controls minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data access, which could lead to data breaches and non-compliance
  with data protection regulations. Improper access management can result in sensitive
  data exposure and potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that roles and permissions assigned to users accessing
  AI models are limited to the minimum necessary for their job functions, adhering
  to the least privilege principle. Verification involves reviewing IAM policies and
  ensuring that roles such as 'Viewer', 'Editor', and 'Owner' are not excessively
  granted. Remediation includes auditing IAM roles, removing unnecessary permissions,
  and employing custom roles for specific needs.
