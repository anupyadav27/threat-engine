service: aiplatform
resource: endpoint
requirement: Ai Services Inference Endpoint Data Capture Gcs Encrypted
scope: aiplatform.endpoint.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure GCS Encryption for AI Endpoint Data Capture
rationale: Encrypting data captured by AI inference endpoints in Google Cloud Storage
  (GCS) is critical to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and
  comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Unencrypted data
  at rest increases the risk of data breaches, potentially leading to financial loss
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if the data captured by AI Platform inference endpoints
  is stored in GCS with encryption enabled. Verify that the GCS bucket used for data
  capture is configured with either Google-managed encryption keys (default) or customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) for enhanced security. To remediate, configure the GCS bucket
  to enforce encryption at rest using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI.
