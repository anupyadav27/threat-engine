title: Ensure VPC Configuration for AI Platform Custom Jobs
rationale: Configuring a VPC for AI Platform custom jobs is vital to control network
  access and protect data from unauthorized exposure. Without a VPC, data could traverse
  the public internet, increasing the risk of interception or unauthorized access.
  Proper VPC setup also helps meet compliance requirements by ensuring that data processing
  occurs within a controlled network environment.
description: This rule verifies that AI Platform custom jobs are configured to use
  a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, which ensures network isolation and secure
  data transit. To check compliance, confirm that each custom job specifies a VPC
  network in its configuration. Remediation involves updating the custom job settings
  to include a VPC network specification, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console
  or using the gcloud command-line tool.
