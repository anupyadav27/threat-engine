domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Enforce Private Networking for ML HPO in AI Platform
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Machine Learning Hyperparameter Optimization
  (HPO) ensures that data and model training communications are restricted to secure,
  internal networks. This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access,
  which can lead to intellectual property theft and compliance violations with standards
  like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether Machine Learning HPO processes in Google AI
  Platform use private networking configurations. Specifically, it verifies that training
  pipelines are set to use a VPC network, preventing exposure to the public internet.
  To remediate, configure the AI Platform training pipeline with a VPC network by
  setting the 'network' field in the pipeline's trainingInput to the appropriate VPC
  name.
