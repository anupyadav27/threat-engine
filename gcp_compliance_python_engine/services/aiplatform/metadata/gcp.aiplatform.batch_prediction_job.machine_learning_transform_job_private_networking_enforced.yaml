resource: batch_prediction_job
requirement: Machine Learning Transform Job Private Networking Enforced
scope: aiplatform.batch_prediction_job.network_security
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Enforce Private Networking for ML Transform Jobs
rationale: Ensuring that machine learning transform jobs utilize private networking
  significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing exposure to the public internet.
  This mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, supporting compliance
  with standards like HIPAA and ISO 27001 which require robust network security controls.
description: This rule checks if batch prediction jobs in the AI Platform are configured
  to use private networking, ensuring they do not have external IP addresses. Verify
  that the 'network' field in the job configuration is set to a private network. To
  enforce this, configure a VPC Network to enable private connectivity, and apply
  it to your batch prediction jobs. This reduces potential attack vectors by restricting
  access to internal GCP networks only.
