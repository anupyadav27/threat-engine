title: Ensure Private Networking for AI Transform Jobs
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Transform Jobs in GCP minimizes exposure
  to public networks, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
  This configuration supports compliance with data protection regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring data remains within controlled network boundaries. Without
  private networking, sensitive data processed in AI jobs could be vulnerable to interception
  or exfiltration.
description: This rule checks if AI Transform Jobs in GCP AI Platform are configured
  to use private networking, which routes job traffic through internal IPs instead
  of the public internet. To verify, ensure that the 'network' field in the BatchPredictionJob
  resource is set to a valid VPC network. Remediation involves updating existing jobs
  to specify a VPC network and configuring new jobs with private networking by default.
  This can typically be done through the GCP Console, gcloud command-line tool, or
  API.
