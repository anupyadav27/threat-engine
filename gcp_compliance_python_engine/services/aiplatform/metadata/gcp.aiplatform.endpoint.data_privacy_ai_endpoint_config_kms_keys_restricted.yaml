domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Restrict KMS Keys for AI Platform Endpoint Configurations
rationale: Restricting KMS keys for AI Platform endpoints is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  data access and ensure that sensitive data is encrypted at rest. Limiting key usage
  only to specific services and environments mitigates risk of data breaches and supports
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that AI Platform endpoint configurations use customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) from Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Ensure that only
  authorized personnel and services have access to these keys. Verify key restrictions
  by reviewing IAM policies associated with each key and limit the access scope to
  necessary roles. Remediation involves updating IAM policies to enforce principle
  of least privilege and rotating keys regularly.
