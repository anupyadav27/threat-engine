title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Platform Pipeline IAM Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Platform Pipeline IAM roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources, reducing potential
  security breaches. This aligns with compliance requirements, such as NIST and ISO
  27001, which mandate strict access controls to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  Inadequate privilege management can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform Pipeline jobs are assigned IAM roles
  that adhere to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that roles only have
  permissions necessary to perform their tasks, without excess access. To verify,
  review IAM role assignments for pipeline jobs and adjust permissions to the minimum
  required. Remediation involves auditing current roles and applying more restrictive
  policies using GCP's IAM policy management tools.
