title: Enforce Private Networking for MLOps Monitoring on AI Platform
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Platform MLOps monitoring reduces exposure
  to public internet threats, minimizing risks of unauthorized access or data leaks.
  This ensures sensitive machine learning operations and data are protected, aligning
  with security best practices and compliance standards like HIPAA and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints for MLOps monitoring are configured
  to use private networking, preventing exposure to public networks. Verify that endpoints
  are accessible only through VPCs, enhancing security by ensuring data and operations
  remain within a controlled network environment. To remediate, configure AI Platform
  with private IPs in the VPC settings, ensuring all monitoring endpoints are accessible
  only through secure, internal networks.
