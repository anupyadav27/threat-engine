title: Ensure AI Services Prompt Gateway Authentication is Enabled
rationale: Requiring authentication for AI services prompt gateway access helps prevent
  unauthorized usage and data exposure, safeguarding sensitive AI model interactions.
  Lack of authentication can lead to security breaches, compromise of AI models, and
  non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, impacting business reputation
  and financial standing.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform endpoints have authentication enabled
  for their prompt gateways, ensuring only authorized users can access AI services.
  To verify, check the endpoint configuration for the presence of authentication settings.
  Remediation involves configuring OAuth 2.0 for API access and ensuring IAM roles
  are correctly assigned. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
