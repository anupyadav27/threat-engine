title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Human Review UI
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Human Review UI mitigates the risk
  of data exposure over the internet, reducing vulnerability to unauthorized access
  and data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining data privacy and meeting compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, especially when handling sensitive data through
  AI platforms.
description: This rule checks that AI Human Review UI is configured to operate within
  a private network, ensuring data is not exposed to public networks. Verify that
  the 'network' field in pipeline job configurations references a valid VPC network.
  Remediation involves configuring the AI Platform to use private networking by setting
  up a private Google Access and ensuring the pipeline job is deployed within this
  network. This setup helps in securing data in transit and aligns with organizational
  data protection policies.
