title: Ensure Least Privileged IAM Roles for AI Notebook Workspaces
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to IAM roles for AI Notebook
  workspaces minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential
  misuse of AI resources. This is crucial for maintaining a secure environment, protecting
  sensitive data, and adhering to compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and
  ISO 27001.
description: This rule verifies that IAM roles assigned to AI Notebook workspaces
  are granted only the permissions necessary for their function. It checks for overly
  permissive roles and suggests adjustments to align with the least privilege principle.
  Remediation involves reviewing assigned roles, identifying excessive permissions,
  and modifying or creating custom roles with restricted privileges. Ensure only essential
  permissions are granted by using Google Cloud IAM's predefined or custom roles appropriately.
