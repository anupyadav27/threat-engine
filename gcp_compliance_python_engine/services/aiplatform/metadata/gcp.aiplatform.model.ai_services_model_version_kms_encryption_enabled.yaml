title: Ensure KMS Encryption for AI Model Versions
rationale: Encrypting AI model versions with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
  protects sensitive AI data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance with
  regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA. Without proper encryption, AI models
  may be vulnerable to data breaches, risking intellectual property theft and regulatory
  fines.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform model versions are encrypted using Google
  Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). To verify, ensure that the 'kmsKeyName' attribute
  is specified in the model's configuration. If not set, update the model configuration
  to include a KMS key. This enforces encryption at rest using customer-managed keys,
  enhancing data security and control.
