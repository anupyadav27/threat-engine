service: aiplatform
resource: endpoint
requirement: Ml Ops Monitoring Outputs Encrypted And Private
scope: aiplatform.endpoint.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure MLOps Monitoring Outputs Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encryption of MLOps monitoring outputs is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring privacy and encryption helps mitigate
  risks associated with data leaks and enhances trust in GCP's AI Platform services.
description: This rule checks that MLOps monitoring outputs in AI Platform endpoints
  are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). Verify that
  the outputs are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket with encryption enabled
  and access restricted to authorized users only. To remediate, configure the endpoint
  to use CMEK for encryption and set appropriate IAM policies to limit access.
