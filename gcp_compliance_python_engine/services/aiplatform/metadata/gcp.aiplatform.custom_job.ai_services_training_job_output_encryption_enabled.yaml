title: Ensure AI Job Output Encryption in Custom Jobs
rationale: Enabling encryption for AI job outputs in GCP mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  data access and exposure, which is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity. It addresses potential threat scenarios where sensitive AI model
  outputs might be intercepted or stored in an unsecured manner. This practice is
  vital for compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ensures
  alignment with organizational security policies.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform custom job outputs have encryption
  enabled at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure
  that the custom job configurations specify an encryption key. Remediation involves
  updating the AI job configuration to include a valid CMEK, which can be done via
  the GCP Console or CLI by specifying the `kmsKeyName` parameter. This ensures that
  all data written by the AI job is encrypted with the specified key, enhancing data
  protection.
