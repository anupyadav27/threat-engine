title: Ensure WAF is Attached to AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to AI Platform endpoints helps
  protect against common web exploits and vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive
  data processed by AI models. It mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data
  breaches, essential for compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA. Without a
  WAF, endpoints are vulnerable to attacks that could lead to service disruptions
  or data loss.
description: This rule checks if a Web Application Firewall (WAF) is attached to Google
  Cloud AI Platform endpoints. The WAF should be configured to monitor and filter
  HTTP traffic to the AI services, providing a layer of security against common threats
  such as SQL injection and XSS attacks. To verify compliance, ensure that the AI
  Platform endpoints are integrated with Cloud Armor or another WAF solution. Remediation
  involves configuring a WAF policy and associating it with the respective AI Platform
  endpoint.
