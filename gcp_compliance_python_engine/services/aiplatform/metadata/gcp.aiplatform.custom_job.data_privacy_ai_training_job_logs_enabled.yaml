title: Ensure AI Training Job Logs are Enabled for Data Privacy
rationale: Enabling AI training job logs is crucial for maintaining data privacy and
  ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Logs provide
  a detailed record of access and processing, which helps in identifying unauthorized
  access or data misuse. This control mitigates risks associated with data breaches
  and unauthorized data usage, thus protecting sensitive information and maintaining
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for custom AI training jobs
  on GCP. Logging should be configured to capture detailed information about data
  access and processing activities. To verify, ensure that the 'enable_logging' parameter
  is set to true in the AI Platform custom job configuration. Remediation involves
  updating the job configuration to enable logging, thereby ensuring that all operations
  are tracked and auditable.
