title: Encrypt AI Model Artifacts with CMEK in GCP AI Platform
rationale: Encrypting AI model artifacts using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
  ensures that organizations maintain control over cryptographic keys, reducing the
  risk of unauthorized access. This measure is crucial for protecting intellectual
  property and sensitive data, aligning with regulatory mandates like GDPR and HIPAA
  that require robust data protection practices.
description: This rule checks if AI model artifacts in Google Cloud AI Platform are
  encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure that
  model resources are configured with a user-specified KMS key. Remediation involves
  setting the AI Platform model to use a CMEK by updating the model's encryption settings
  via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool. This enhances data protection
  by giving you full control over encryption keys.
