title: Enforce Authentication for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Requiring authentication for AI Platform endpoints ensures that only authorized
  users and applications can access machine learning models and services. This prevents
  unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches or misuse of machine learning
  resources. Ensuring proper authentication aligns with compliance requirements such
  as GDPR and helps safeguard sensitive data processed by AI services.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform endpoints have authentication mechanisms
  enabled to restrict access to authorized entities. To verify, ensure that endpoint
  configurations require authentication tokens or service account credentials for
  access. Remediation involves updating endpoint settings to enforce authentication
  protocols such as OAuth 2.0. This enhances security by validating the identity of
  users and applications before granting access to AI resources.
