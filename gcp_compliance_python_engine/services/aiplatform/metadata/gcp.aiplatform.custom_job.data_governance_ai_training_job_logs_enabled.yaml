title: Enable Logging for AI Training Custom Jobs
rationale: Enabling logging for AI training custom jobs is crucial for maintaining
  transparency and accountability in data operations. It helps in tracking the flow
  of data, identifying anomalies, and ensuring that data handling complies with organizational
  policies and regulatory requirements. Without logging, it becomes challenging to
  audit data processing activities, increasing the risk of data breaches and compliance
  violations.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for custom jobs in
  the AI Platform. Audit logs should be configured to capture all data processing
  activities, including data input, output, and transformation operations. To verify,
  ensure that Stackdriver Logging is set up for the AI Platform and that custom job
  logs are actively monitored. Remediation involves configuring audit logs through
  the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud commands to enable and manage Stackdriver
  Logging for the AI Platform.
