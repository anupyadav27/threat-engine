title: Enable Data Governance Logging for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling data governance logging for AI Platform endpoints is essential
  to ensure full visibility into data access and usage patterns. This logging helps
  detect unauthorized access attempts and provides a trail for forensic investigations.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with regulatory requirements like GDPR and
  CCPA, which mandate detailed data access records.
description: This rule checks whether data governance logs are enabled for AI Platform
  endpoints, ensuring audit trails are maintained. Verify that logging is active by
  inspecting the endpoint's configuration settings in the GCP Console under 'Logging
  and Monitoring'. To enable logging, navigate to the AI Platform, select the endpoint,
  and ensure that logging is turned on in the 'Logging' section. Regularly review
  logs to monitor for suspicious activity.
