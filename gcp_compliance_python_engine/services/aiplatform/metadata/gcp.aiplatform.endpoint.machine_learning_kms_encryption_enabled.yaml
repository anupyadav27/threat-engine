title: Ensure KMS Encryption for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI Platform endpoints is crucial to protect
  sensitive machine learning models and data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. This practice mitigates the risk of data exposure and aligns with regulatory
  requirements for data protection, such as GDPR and CCPA, by ensuring that data at
  rest is encrypted using Cloud KMS keys.
description: This rule checks whether AI Platform endpoints are configured to use
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) provided by Google Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS). To verify compliance, ensure that each endpoint's encryption settings
  explicitly reference a valid KMS key. Remediate non-compliant endpoints by configuring
  them to use a KMS key via the AI Platform's endpoint configuration settings in the
  GCP Console or by using the appropriate gcloud CLI command.
