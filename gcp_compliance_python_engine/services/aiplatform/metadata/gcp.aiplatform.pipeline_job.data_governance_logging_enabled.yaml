title: Ensure Data Governance Logging for AI Platform Pipeline Jobs
rationale: Data governance logging is crucial for monitoring and auditing AI workflows,
  providing visibility into data access and manipulation within pipeline jobs. Without
  proper logging, organizations risk unauthorized data access, potential data breaches,
  and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, which can lead to severe
  legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that data governance logging is enabled for AI Platform
  pipeline jobs to ensure all data activities are captured in audit logs. To implement,
  configure AI Platform pipeline jobs in the Google Cloud Console to ensure Cloud
  Audit Logs are activated for data access. Remediation involves enabling logging
  through IAM permissions and configuring logging sinks to capture and store logs
  in Cloud Logging for review and analysis.
