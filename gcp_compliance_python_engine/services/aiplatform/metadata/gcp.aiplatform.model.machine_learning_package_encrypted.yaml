title: Ensure ML Packages in AI Platform are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting machine learning packages at rest in AI Platform protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of data, especially in regulated industries where
  compliance with standards such as HIPAA and PCI-DSS is mandatory. Encryption helps
  mitigate risks related to data exposure in case of unauthorized access to storage
  systems.
description: This rule checks whether machine learning packages stored in AI Platform
  are encrypted using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. To verify,
  ensure that the AI Platform models have encryption configurations enabled in their
  settings. Remediation involves configuring the AI Platform to use Google Cloud Key
  Management Service (KMS) for encrypting data at rest by specifying a customer-managed
  key during model creation or update.
