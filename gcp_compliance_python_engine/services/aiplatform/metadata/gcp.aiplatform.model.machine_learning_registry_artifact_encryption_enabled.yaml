requirement: Machine Learning Registry Artifact Encryption Enabled
scope: aiplatform.model.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Encryption for AI Platform Model Artifacts
rationale: Encrypting machine learning registry artifacts helps protect sensitive
  model data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial
  for maintaining data confidentiality, meeting legal and regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR or HIPAA, and preserving the integrity of AI models used in critical
  business processes.
description: This rule verifies that all machine learning model artifacts stored in
  Google Cloud AI Platform are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption
  keys (CMEK). To comply, ensure that each model in the AI Platform has encryption
  enabled with a specified CMEK in the model's settings. This can be validated by
  checking the encryption configuration in the Google Cloud Console under AI Platform
  settings or via the gcloud command-line tool. To remediate, configure the AI Platform
  model to use a CMEK through the Google Cloud Console or update the model configuration
  via the AI Platform API.
