title: Enable ML Ops Monitoring Logs for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling ML Ops monitoring logs for AI Platform endpoints is crucial for
  maintaining visibility into model performance and operational metrics. This logging
  helps detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compliance with data handling
  policies. It mitigates risks associated with undetected model drift and performance
  degradation, which could lead to inaccurate predictions and business losses.
description: This rule checks whether ML Ops monitoring logs are enabled for AI Platform
  endpoints, ensuring that model operations are being logged for analysis. To verify,
  navigate to the Google Cloud Console under AI Platform > Endpoints, and confirm
  that logging is enabled in the settings. If not enabled, configure logging by setting
  up a logging sink that routes logs to Cloud Logging. This allows for continuous
  monitoring and early detection of issues in ML models.
