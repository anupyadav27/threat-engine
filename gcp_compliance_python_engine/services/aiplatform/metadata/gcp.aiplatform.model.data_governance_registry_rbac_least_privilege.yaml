rule_id: gcp.aiplatform.model.data_governance_registry_rbac_least_privilege
service: aiplatform
resource: model
requirement: Data Governance Registry RBAC Least Privilege
scope: aiplatform.model.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure AI Platform Model Uses Least Privilege RBAC
rationale: Implementing least privilege RBAC in the AI Platform models minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches or malicious manipulation
  of machine learning models. This helps in maintaining data integrity, complying
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and CCPA, and protecting sensitive intellectual
  property.
description: This rule checks if the AI Platform model employs least privilege principles
  by verifying the role assignments in the Data Governance Registry. Ensure that only
  necessary roles with minimal permissions are granted to users and service accounts.
  To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies to remove excessive permissions while
  ensuring operational needs are met.
