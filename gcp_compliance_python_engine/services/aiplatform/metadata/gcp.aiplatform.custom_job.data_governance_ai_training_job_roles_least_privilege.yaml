title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Platform Custom Job Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Platform custom jobs is crucial to
  minimizing the potential attack surface and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive
  data and resources. Over-privileged roles can lead to data breaches, financial loss,
  and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring roles have
  only the necessary permissions helps mitigate insider threats and external attacks.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles assigned to AI Platform custom jobs adhere
  to the principle of least privilege, meaning they only have permissions necessary
  for their intended functions. Verify role assignments by reviewing IAM policies
  and removing any excess permissions or roles not required for job execution. Remediate
  by adjusting policies to align with job requirements, ensuring sensitive resources
  are accessible only to authorized jobs.
