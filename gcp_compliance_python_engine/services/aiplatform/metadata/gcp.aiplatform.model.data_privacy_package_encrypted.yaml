subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Platform Model Data Privacy Package is Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting data privacy packages for AI models mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive data, which can result in data breaches and compliance violations.
  This measure is crucial for protecting intellectual property and maintaining trust
  with customers and stakeholders. Non-compliance with encryption standards can lead
  to severe regulatory penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether the data privacy packages associated with AI
  Platform models are encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that the 'encryption_spec' field is specified in the model's
  configuration settings, which should point to a valid Cloud KMS key. Remediation
  involves updating the model configuration to include an appropriate encryption key
  for securing the data privacy package.
