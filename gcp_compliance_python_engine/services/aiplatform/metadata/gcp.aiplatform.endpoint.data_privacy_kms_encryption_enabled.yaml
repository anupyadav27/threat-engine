title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for AI Platform endpoints
  protects sensitive data by encrypting it with customer-managed keys, thereby mitigating
  the risk of unauthorized data access. This practice is crucial for maintaining data
  confidentiality, especially in environments handling personal or sensitive information,
  and it supports compliance with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if AI Platform endpoints are configured to use customer-managed
  KMS keys for data encryption at rest. To verify, ensure that each endpoint within
  your AI Platform is associated with a KMS key. Remediation involves configuring
  AI Platform endpoints to use an existing KMS key by updating the endpoint configuration
  to include the 'encryptionSpec.kmsKeyName' property with the appropriate key identifier.
