title: Enforce Authn for GCP AI Platform Endpoints
rationale: Requiring authentication for AI Platform endpoints mitigates unauthorized
  access risks, ensuring that only legitimate users and services can interact with
  your AI models. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data processed by AI services
  and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that all AI Platform endpoints are configured to require
  authentication, preventing public and anonymous access. Verify that IAM roles are
  correctly assigned to users and service accounts with appropriate permissions. To
  remediate, configure endpoints to enforce authentication by updating IAM policies
  to restrict access only to authenticated entities.
