title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Platform Training Pipelines
rationale: Ensuring least privilege access for AI Platform training pipelines minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data access and manipulation. Misconfigured access can
  lead to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and non-compliance with regulatory
  standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict data protection and privacy.
  By restricting roles to only necessary permissions, you reduce the attack surface
  and potential for insider threats.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to AI Platform training pipelines
  adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it ensures that only the
  necessary permissions are granted for data governance and hyperparameter optimization.
  To verify, review IAM policies associated with AI Platform resources and confirm
  that roles are appropriately scoped. Remediation involves auditing current roles,
  removing excessive permissions, and only assigning predefined roles like 'AI Platform
  User', ensuring they are limited to required operations.
