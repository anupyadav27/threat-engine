service: secretmanager
resource: secret
requirement: Secrets No Plaintext Exposed In Policy Or Tags
scope: secretmanager.secret.policy_management
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Prevent Exposure of Secrets in Policies or Tags
rationale: Exposing plaintext secrets in IAM policies or resource tags increases the
  risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Malicious actors or unintentional
  internal accesses can exploit these exposures to compromise sensitive information,
  leading to financial losses and regulatory non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA.
description: This check ensures that sensitive information, such as secrets managed
  by Secret Manager, is not stored in plaintext within IAM policy bindings or resource
  tags. Verify that no secrets are hardcoded or referenced in these areas by reviewing
  IAM policies and tag configurations. To remediate, remove any plaintext secrets
  and utilize Secret Manager's access controls to manage and access secrets securely.
