title: Ensure Secrets have Trusted Issuer in Secret Manager
rationale: Managing secrets with a trusted issuer is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Misconfigured secret issuers can lead to unauthorized
  decryption and misuse of sensitive data, potentially violating compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and SOC2. Ensuring secrets are managed by trusted issuers reduces
  the risk of compromised credentials and enhances the overall security posture.
description: This rule checks if all secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager are issued
  by trusted entities. It verifies the issuer's identity to ensure that secrets are
  not exposed to unverified sources, which could lead to unauthorized access. To comply,
  configure the Secret Manager to accept only specific, trusted issuers through IAM
  policies or organizational policies. Remediate any discrepancies by updating the
  issuer configurations and regularly reviewing issuer trust lists.
