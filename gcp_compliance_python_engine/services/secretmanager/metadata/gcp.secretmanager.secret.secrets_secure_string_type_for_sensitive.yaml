subcategory: key_management
severity: high
title: Ensure Secret Manager Uses Secure String Type for Sensitive Data
rationale: Using Secure String type for secrets in GCP ensures that sensitive information
  is encrypted and securely managed. Failure to use secure string types can result
  in unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory standards
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, potentially leading to significant financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks that all secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager are using
  the Secure String type. It verifies that sensitive data is not stored in plaintext
  or less secure formats. To remediate, ensure all secrets are updated to use the
  Secure String type by utilizing the `gcloud secrets versions add` command with proper
  encryption settings. Regular audits and updates should be conducted to maintain
  compliance and security.
