title: Ensure Secret Manager Secrets Are Patched Regularly
rationale: Regular patching of secrets in GCP's Secret Manager is critical to protect
  sensitive data. Unpatched vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain
  unauthorized access, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations
  like PCI-DSS and GDPR. Ensuring secrets are updated mitigates these risks and maintains
  organizational trust.
description: This rule checks if the secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager are subject
  to a regular patch management process. It verifies that secrets are kept up-to-date
  with the latest security patches and best practices. To remediate, implement automated
  workflows that regularly update and rotate secrets, ensuring alignment with your
  organization's patch management policy.
