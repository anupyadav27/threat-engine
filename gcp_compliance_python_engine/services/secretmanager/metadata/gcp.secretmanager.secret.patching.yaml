title: Ensure Secret Manager Secrets Are Regularly Patched
rationale: Regular patching of secrets in GCP Secret Manager is crucial to mitigate
  vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to
  sensitive information. Unpatched secrets can lead to data breaches, non-compliance
  with regulatory requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA, and potential financial and
  reputational damage to the organization.
description: This rule checks that secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager are regularly
  updated and patched to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.
  This involves verifying that the latest updates and patches are applied to secret
  values and configurations. Remediation includes setting up automated patch management
  processes and ensuring secrets are rotated and updated in adherence to the organization's
  security policy.
