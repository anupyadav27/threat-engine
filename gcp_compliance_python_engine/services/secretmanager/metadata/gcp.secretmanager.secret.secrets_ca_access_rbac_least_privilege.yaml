title: Enforce Least Privilege for Secret Access in Secret Manager
rationale: Implementing least privilege for accessing secrets is crucial to minimizing
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. By restricting
  access rights to the minimum necessary, organizations reduce the attack surface
  available to malicious actors, thus protecting sensitive data and complying with
  regulatory requirements like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if IAM roles granted to users or service accounts for
  accessing secrets in Secret Manager are limited to the least privilege necessary.
  It ensures that roles such as 'Secret Manager Viewer' are only assigned where absolutely
  needed and that sensitive roles like 'Secret Manager Admin' are not overly permissive.
  To verify, review IAM policies and ensure only necessary roles are granted. Remediation
  involves auditing and adjusting IAM policies to align with the principle of least
  privilege.
