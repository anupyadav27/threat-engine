subcategory: key_management
severity: high
title: Ensure Secret Path Length Constraints in Secret Manager
rationale: Defining strict path length constraints for secrets in Secret Manager helps
  mitigate risks of unauthorized access and accidental exposure by ensuring that secret
  paths are not easily guessable. This practice is crucial for maintaining confidentiality
  and integrity of sensitive data, aligning with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001 which mandate robust access controls and data protection measures.
description: This rule checks that the path length for secrets stored in Google Secret
  Manager adheres to defined security policies, ensuring it is neither too short nor
  too complex to avoid predictability and manageability issues. To verify compliance,
  review your secret naming conventions and ensure they follow set constraints. Remediation
  involves updating secret paths to meet the length criteria, utilizing tools like
  Terraform or gcloud CLI for efficient management.
