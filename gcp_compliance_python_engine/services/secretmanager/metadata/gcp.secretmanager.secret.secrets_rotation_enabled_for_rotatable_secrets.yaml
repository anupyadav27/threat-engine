rule_id: gcp.secretmanager.secret.secrets_rotation_enabled_for_rotatable_secrets
service: secretmanager
resource: secret
requirement: Secrets Rotation Enabled For Rotatable Secrets
scope: secretmanager.secret.key_rotation
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
severity: high
title: Ensure Secrets Rotation is Enabled for All Rotatable Secrets
rationale: Rotating secrets regularly minimizes the risk of unauthorized access due
  to secret compromise. It's critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of sensitive information managed by the Secret Manager. Non-compliance can lead
  to data breaches and regulatory penalties under frameworks such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA,
  which require stringent data protection measures.
description: This rule verifies that all secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager, which
  are capable of being rotated, have rotation policies enabled. To ensure secrets
  are rotated frequently, configure a rotation schedule or use automated rotation.
  Verify by checking the 'rotation' configuration of each secret. Remediate by setting
  a rotation policy using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI, specifying the rotation
  period based on your security policy.
