requirement: Secrets Crl Or Ocsp Configured

subcategory: key_management
severity: high
title: Ensure CRL or OCSP is Configured for Secrets
rationale: Configuring Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or Online Certificate Status
  Protocol (OCSP) for secrets ensures that any compromised certificates are rapidly
  invalidated, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. This is
  crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of secrets managed within
  Google Secret Manager. It also supports compliance with industry regulations that
  mandate effective key management processes.
description: This rule checks whether CRL or OCSP is configured for secrets stored
  in Google Secret Manager. Proper configuration involves setting up mechanisms that
  automatically check the validity of certificates associated with secrets. To verify,
  ensure that secret access policies include certificate revocation settings, and
  configure the necessary infrastructure for CRL or OCSP. Remediation involves updating
  secret configurations to include CRL or OCSP endpoints, and ensuring regular audits
  of these settings.
