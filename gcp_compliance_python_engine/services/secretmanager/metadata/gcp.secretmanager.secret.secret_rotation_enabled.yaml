title: Ensure Secret Rotation is Enabled for GCP Secrets
rationale: Enabling secret rotation reduces the risk of exposure by ensuring that
  secrets are regularly updated, thereby minimizing the window of opportunity for
  unauthorized access. This practice is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of sensitive data, aligning with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA which mandate regular updates to access credentials.
description: This rule checks whether automatic secret rotation is enabled for secrets
  stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager. Secrets without rotation can become stale
  and vulnerable to unauthorized access. To verify, check the rotation policy for
  each secret and ensure it is configured to rotate automatically at a regular interval.
  Remediation involves setting a rotation schedule via the GCP Console or using the
  gcloud command-line tool to update the secret's configuration.
