title: Ensure Secrets Alias Points to Active Encryption Key
rationale: Using an active encryption key for secrets is crucial to maintain data
  confidentiality and ensure that secrets are protected with the latest security controls.
  An inactive or deleted key can lead to unauthorized access or data loss, posing
  significant risks to business operations and compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether the alias of a secret in Google Cloud Secret
  Manager points to an active encryption key. An alias pointing to an inactive key
  indicates that the key cannot be used for encryption or decryption, leading to potential
  service disruptions. To remediate, ensure that all secret aliases are updated to
  reference active keys by accessing the Secret Manager in the GCP Console, verifying
  key statuses, and updating aliases as necessary.
