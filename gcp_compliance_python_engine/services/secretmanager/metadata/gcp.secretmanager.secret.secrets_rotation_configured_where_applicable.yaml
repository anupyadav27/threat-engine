title: Ensure Secrets Rotation Configured in Secret Manager
rationale: Regular rotation of secrets is crucial to minimize the risk of exposure
  and unauthorized access. Unrotated secrets can be compromised, leading to potential
  data breaches, legal liabilities, and non-compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001. Automated rotation reduces human error and enhances the security
  posture by ensuring secrets are regularly updated.
description: This rule checks whether secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager have rotation
  policies configured. A rotation policy automatically updates the secret value at
  specified intervals, mitigating the risk of long-term exposure. To verify, inspect
  each secret's configuration for a 'rotation' setting and ensure it is enabled with
  a defined schedule. Remediate by setting or updating the rotation policy in the
  Secret Manager API or Console to meet security best practices.
