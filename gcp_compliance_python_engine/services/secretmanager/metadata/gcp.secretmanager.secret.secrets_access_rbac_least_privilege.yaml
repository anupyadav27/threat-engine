title: Ensure Least Privilege for Secret Manager Access
rationale: Adopting the principle of least privilege minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive information stored in GCP Secret Manager. Inadequate access
  controls can lead to data breaches, compromising business integrity and violating
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing strict RBAC policies
  helps protect critical business secrets from internal and external threats.
description: This rule checks that access to secrets in GCP Secret Manager is granted
  based on the principle of least privilege. It verifies that only necessary roles
  and permissions are assigned to users and service accounts. Remediation involves
  reviewing IAM policies to ensure that roles like 'Secret Manager Admin' or 'Secret
  Manager Secret Accessor' are assigned judiciously, and removing any excessive permissions
  not required for the user's function. Regular audits and monitoring of access logs
  are recommended to maintain secure access controls.
