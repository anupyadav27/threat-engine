title: Ensure Secret Manager is Enabled for Secrets
rationale: Enabling Secret Manager for your secrets in GCP is crucial for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information such as API keys, passwords,
  and certificates. Without proper management, secrets risk being exposed to unauthorized
  access, leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and financial
  losses. Compliance with frameworks like PCI-DSS and SOC2 often requires stringent
  management of sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that the Secret Manager service is enabled for storing
  and managing secrets within your GCP environment. It verifies the presence of the
  Secret Manager API and that secrets are actively managed using this service. To
  remediate, ensure that the Secret Manager API is enabled in your GCP project and
  that all sensitive information is stored and managed through this API. Regularly
  audit and rotate your secrets to maintain secure access.
