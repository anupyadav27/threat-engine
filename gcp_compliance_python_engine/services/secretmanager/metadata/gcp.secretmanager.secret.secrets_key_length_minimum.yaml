service: secretmanager
resource: secret
requirement: Secrets Key Length Minimum
scope: secretmanager.secret.security
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
severity: high
title: Ensure Secret Key Length Is At Least 256 Bits
rationale: Secrets with insufficient key length are vulnerable to brute force attacks,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. Ensuring a minimum
  key length supports robust encryption, protecting sensitive information and aligning
  with compliance mandates like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that all keys managed within GCP Secret Manager have
  a minimum length of 256 bits. Keys below this threshold are considered weak and
  can be compromised more easily. To verify, inspect the key length settings in your
  GCP Secret Manager and update any keys below 256 bits using the GCP Console or CLI.
  Implementing this change strengthens your security posture by enhancing the encryption
  of sensitive data.
