title: Ensure Secret Manager Secrets Meet Compliance Standards
rationale: Proper management and compliance of secrets in GCP Secret Manager are crucial
  for protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust. Non-compliance can lead to
  unauthorized access, data breaches, and significant financial and reputational damage.
  Regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA mandate strict key management practices
  to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks that secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager adhere to
  defined compliance policies, including encryption standards, access controls, and
  expiration dates. Verification involves ensuring that secrets are encrypted with
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) and access permissions are reviewed regularly.
  Remediation includes configuring CMEK for secrets and implementing role-based access
  control (RBAC) to limit exposure.
