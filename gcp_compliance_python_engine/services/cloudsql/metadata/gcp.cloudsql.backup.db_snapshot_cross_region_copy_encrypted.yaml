title: Ensure Cross-Region SQL Backups are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting cross-region backups of Cloud SQL instances protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access during transit and storage in different geographic
  locations. This measure reduces the risk of data breaches that can lead to financial
  loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance with data protection regulations like
  GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule verifies that all cross-region copies of Cloud SQL backups
  are encrypted using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To ensure compliance,
  configure the Cloud SQL instance to use CMEK for backups and verify encryption settings
  in the GCP Console under the 'Backups' section for each instance. Remediation involves
  enabling CMEK and ensuring that the key is available and managed properly.
