title: Enable Log Disconnections for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Logging disconnections in Cloud SQL helps identify potential issues such
  as network interruptions, unauthorized access attempts, or performance bottlenecks.
  This can be crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of database operations.
  Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance requirements by providing a detailed
  audit trail of all disconnection events.
description: This rule checks if the 'log_disconnections' flag is enabled for Cloud
  SQL instances, ensuring that disconnection events are logged. To verify, review
  the instance configuration for the 'log_disconnections' setting. If not enabled,
  update the instance settings to include this flag. Logging disconnections can be
  done through the Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud command-line tool, providing
  visibility into database access patterns and potential anomalies.
