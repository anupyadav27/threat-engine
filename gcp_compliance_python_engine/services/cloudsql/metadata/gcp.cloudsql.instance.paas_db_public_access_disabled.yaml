title: Disable Public Access to Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Exposing Cloud SQL instances to the public internet poses significant security
  risks, including unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Disabling public
  access reduces the attack surface and helps comply with regulatory requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized
  exposure.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud SQL instances are configured to deny public
  IP access, ensuring they are only accessible via private IP addresses within Google
  Cloud VPCs. To verify, inspect the instance settings in the GCP Console and ensure
  'Public IP' is not enabled. If necessary, modify the instance to use private IPs
  and configure appropriate VPC peering or VPN connections to maintain secure access.
