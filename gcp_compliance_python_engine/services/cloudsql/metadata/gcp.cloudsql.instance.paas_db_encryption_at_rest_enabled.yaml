title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for GCP Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Encryption at rest protects sensitive data by ensuring it is not readable
  without proper authorization, reducing the risk of data breaches. It mitigates threats
  from unauthorized access and meets compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and PCI-DSS, which mandate data protection through encryption.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud SQL instances have encryption at rest
  enabled, which safeguards data stored within the databases. To verify, ensure that
  the 'disk_encryption_configuration' settings in the Cloud SQL instance configuration
  are applied. Remediation involves using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to
  set up Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) or let Google manage encryption keys
  to secure data at rest.
