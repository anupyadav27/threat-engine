title: Ensure Cloud SQL Backup Snapshots Are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting Cloud SQL backup snapshots protects sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. It mitigates risks related to data exfiltration
  and aligns with regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS,
  which mandate encryption of data at rest. Unencrypted backups can expose sensitive
  information, leading to legal penalties and damage to organizational reputation.
description: This rule checks that all Cloud SQL database backup snapshots are encrypted
  using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure that the `encryptionConfiguration`
  field is set in the Cloud SQL instance settings. If not configured, enable encryption
  by setting up a CMEK in Google Cloud's Key Management Service (KMS) and associate
  it with your Cloud SQL instances. Regularly audit backup configurations to maintain
  compliance.
