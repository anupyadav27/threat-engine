title: Enable Audit Logging for Cloud SQL Instances Where Supported
rationale: Audit logging for Cloud SQL instances helps track unauthorized access and
  changes, which is crucial for identifying potential security incidents and maintaining
  accountability. It supports compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA
  by providing a detailed audit trail of database activities. Without audit logging,
  organizations may face undetected data breaches, leading to financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for Cloud SQL instances
  where supported. To verify, ensure the 'cloudsql.googleapis.com/sql/admin_audit'
  log is active in the Google Cloud Console under Logging > Logs Explorer. Remediation
  involves enabling audit logs by configuring the appropriate database flags and ensuring
  IAM roles have sufficient permissions for logging. This setting helps capture detailed
  logs of database activities for security monitoring and incident response.
