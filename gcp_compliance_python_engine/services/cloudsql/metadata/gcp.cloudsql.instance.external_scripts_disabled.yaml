title: Disable External Scripts for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Disabling external scripts execution in Cloud SQL reduces the potential
  attack surface by preventing malicious code from running within the database environment.
  This enhances data integrity and helps comply with regulatory frameworks such as
  PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which require secure data handling practices. It also mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized data access and compromise through external scripts that
  could exploit database vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks whether external scripts are disabled for Cloud SQL
  instances, ensuring that scripts cannot be executed from external sources. To verify
  compliance, review the Cloud SQL instance settings in the GCP Console or via gcloud
  CLI to ensure the 'external_scripts' flag is set to 'off'. Remediation involves
  updating the instance configuration to disable external script execution, which
  can be done through the GCP Console under the instance's 'Flags' section or using
  the gcloud command line tool.
