title: Enable Automated Backups for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Automated backups are crucial for data recovery in case of accidental data
  loss, corruption, or system failure. Enabling this feature helps ensure business
  continuity by minimizing downtime and data loss, meeting regulatory requirements
  for data protection and resilience in frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks whether automated backups are enabled for Cloud SQL
  instances. Automated backups must be configured to run at regular intervals, ensuring
  that recent copies of the database are available for restoration. To verify, navigate
  to the Cloud SQL Instance settings and ensure that automated backups are activated.
  Remediation involves enabling automated backups through the GCP Console or using
  the gcloud command line tool, specifying the desired backup window and retention
  period.
