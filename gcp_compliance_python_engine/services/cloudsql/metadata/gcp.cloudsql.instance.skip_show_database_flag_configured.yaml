title: Ensure 'skip_show_database' Flag is Properly Configured in Cloud SQL
rationale: The 'skip_show_database' flag limits the information an unauthorized user
  can retrieve from the server, reducing the risk of data exposure and potential information
  leakage. This is crucial for protecting sensitive metadata about databases, which
  could otherwise be exploited in targeted attacks. Ensuring this flag is configured
  aligns with data protection policies and helps meet compliance requirements related
  to data privacy standards.
description: This rule checks if the 'skip_show_database' flag is set on Cloud SQL
  instances. When enabled, this flag prevents users from seeing all available databases
  on the instance, enhancing security by limiting information exposure. To verify,
  navigate to the Cloud SQL instance settings and confirm that the flag is set. Remediation
  involves enabling this setting through the Google Cloud Console, gcloud command-line
  tool, or API. It is critical for maintaining data confidentiality and minimizing
  the risk of unauthorized access to database metadata.
