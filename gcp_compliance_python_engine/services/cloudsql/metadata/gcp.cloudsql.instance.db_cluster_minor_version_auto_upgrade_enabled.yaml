title: Enable Auto Upgrade for Cloud SQL Minor Versions
rationale: Enabling automatic minor version upgrades for Cloud SQL ensures that database
  instances receive the latest security patches and enhancements. This minimizes exposure
  to vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of data breaches that can lead to financial
  losses and reputational damage. It also aids in maintaining compliance with regulatory
  standards that require up-to-date software.
description: This rule checks if Cloud SQL instances have the minor version auto upgrade
  feature enabled. This ensures that instances are automatically updated with the
  latest minor version releases, which often include critical security patches and
  performance improvements. To verify, check the Cloud SQL instance settings in the
  Google Cloud Console or use the gcloud CLI. If not enabled, configure the instance
  to allow minor version auto upgrades through the instance settings.
