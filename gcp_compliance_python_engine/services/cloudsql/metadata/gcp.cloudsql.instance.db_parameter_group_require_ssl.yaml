title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Enforce SSL Connections
rationale: Enforcing SSL connections for Cloud SQL instances is critical to protect
  data in transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This helps maintain
  data confidentiality and integrity, which is essential for meeting compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Without SSL, sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized
  parties, leading to potential data breaches and financial loss.
description: This rule verifies that Cloud SQL instances are configured to require
  SSL connections by checking the 'require_ssl' parameter in the database's parameter
  group. To ensure compliance, navigate to the Cloud SQL instance settings in the
  GCP Console and under 'Connections', enable 'SSL connections only'. Remediation
  involves updating the parameter group or applying a new one that enforces SSL, and
  ensuring that all client applications are configured to use SSL.
