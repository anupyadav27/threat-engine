title: Ensure Cloud SQL Snapshots Do Not Have Public Access
rationale: Public access to Cloud SQL snapshots poses significant security risks,
  including unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. This can lead
  to the compromise of sensitive information, financial loss, and non-compliance with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Protecting snapshots by restricting
  public access is crucial to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your
  database backups.
description: This rule checks if any Cloud SQL backups have been configured with public
  access. Ensuring that snapshots are not publicly accessible prevents unauthorized
  entities from retrieving sensitive data. Verify the backup's access settings in
  the Google Cloud Console under Cloud SQL > Backups, and ensure that no public IPs
  are listed. Remediate by configuring access restrictions to allow only authorized
  users and IP addresses.
