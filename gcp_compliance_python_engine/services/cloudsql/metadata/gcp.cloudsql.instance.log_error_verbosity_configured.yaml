title: Ensure Cloud SQL Log Error Verbosity is Configured
rationale: Configuring log error verbosity in Cloud SQL is essential for capturing
  detailed error logs, which help in diagnosing issues, ensuring accountability, and
  maintaining transparency. This setup aids in forensic investigations and is crucial
  for compliance with regulations like PCI-DSS and SOC 2, which require detailed logging
  for audit purposes.
description: This rule checks whether the log error verbosity setting is configured
  on Cloud SQL instances. Proper configuration ensures that error logs are verbose
  enough to provide meaningful insights into database operations and issues. To verify,
  check the 'log_error_verbosity' setting in the database flags. Remediation involves
  setting the verbosity level to 'VERBOSE' or 'ERROR' as per the security policy requirements.
