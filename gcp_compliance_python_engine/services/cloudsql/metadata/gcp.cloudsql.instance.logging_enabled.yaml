title: Enable Logging for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Enabling logging on Cloud SQL instances is crucial for monitoring access
  and activity, which helps in detecting unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Logging is also important for compliance with regulatory frameworks like PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA, which mandate detailed logging of access to sensitive data. Without logging,
  it is difficult to audit actions taken within the database, increasing the risk
  of undetected malicious activities.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for Cloud SQL instances,
  ensuring that all database operations are recorded. To verify, check the instance
  settings in the Google Cloud Console and ensure that the 'Enable Logging' option
  is activated. If not, navigate to the SQL instance settings and enable logging to
  capture all activities. This action allows for detailed auditing and issue resolution
  by maintaining an operational log of database activities.
