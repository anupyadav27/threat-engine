title: Disable Default Admin Account on GCP SQL Instances
rationale: The presence of default admin accounts in Cloud SQL instances poses significant
  security risks, such as unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Attackers
  can exploit these accounts to gain full control over the database, compromising
  sensitive information. Ensuring these accounts are disabled aligns with compliance
  requirements like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate strict access controls.
description: This rule checks for the presence of default admin accounts on Cloud
  SQL instances, which should be disabled to prevent unauthorized access. Administrators
  should create custom accounts with the least privilege necessary for their operations.
  To verify, inspect the user list on each SQL instance and ensure no default admin
  accounts are enabled. Remediation involves disabling these accounts and setting
  up custom admin accounts with strong, unique credentials.
