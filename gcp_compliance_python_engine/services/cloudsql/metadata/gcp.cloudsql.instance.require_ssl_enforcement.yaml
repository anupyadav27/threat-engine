title: Enforce SSL for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Enforcing SSL for Cloud SQL instances prevents unauthorized interception
  and tampering of data in transit, which is crucial for protecting sensitive information
  and maintaining privacy. This measure mitigates the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks
  and is often required for compliance with data protection regulations such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if SSL is enforced for all Cloud SQL instances, ensuring
  that database connections are encrypted. To verify, inspect the 'require_ssl' setting
  in the Cloud SQL instance configuration. If not enabled, configure the instance
  to require SSL by setting the 'require_ssl' option to true in the Google Cloud Console
  or using gcloud command-line tools. This action ensures that all incoming connections
  use SSL for encryption.
