title: Disable Insecure Extensions in Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Insecure database extensions can introduce vulnerabilities, allowing attackers
  to exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
  This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and protecting sensitive information,
  aligning with compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for the presence of insecure extensions in Cloud SQL
  instances. It ensures that such extensions, which are not recommended due to security
  risks, are disabled. To verify, review the list of enabled extensions in the Cloud
  SQL instance settings and disable any that are deemed insecure. Remediation involves
  updating the instance configuration to exclude these extensions, thereby reducing
  the attack surface.
