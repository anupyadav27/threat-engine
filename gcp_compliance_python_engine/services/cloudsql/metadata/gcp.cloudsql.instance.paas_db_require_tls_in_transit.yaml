title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Use TLS for Data in Transit
rationale: Enforcing TLS for data in transit protects against man-in-the-middle attacks,
  ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data. This is crucial for maintaining
  trust with customers and complying with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and
  HIPAA, which mandate encryption of sensitive data during transmission.
description: This rule checks that all Cloud SQL instances have TLS enabled for data
  in transit, ensuring secure communication between clients and databases. To verify,
  ensure the database instance is configured to require SSL/TLS connections. Remediation
  involves setting the 'require_ssl' flag to 'on' in the Cloud SQL instance settings
  and updating client configurations to use SSL/TLS for connections.
