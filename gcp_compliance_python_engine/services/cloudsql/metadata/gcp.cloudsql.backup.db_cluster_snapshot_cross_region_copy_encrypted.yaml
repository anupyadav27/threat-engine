title: Ensure Cloud SQL Snapshots Are Encrypted for Cross-Region Copies
rationale: Encrypting database cluster snapshot copies across regions protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access during transit and at rest. This measure mitigates
  the risk of data breaches, reduces potential exposure to legal liabilities, and
  aligns with compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data
  protection strategies.
description: This rule checks whether your Cloud SQL database snapshots that are copied
  across regions are encrypted. To verify this, ensure that the 'encryptionConfiguration'
  field is set in the Cloud SQL instance settings. If not enabled, configure Cloud
  SQL to use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for snapshots. This ensures the
  data is encrypted using keys that you control, providing an additional layer of
  security.
