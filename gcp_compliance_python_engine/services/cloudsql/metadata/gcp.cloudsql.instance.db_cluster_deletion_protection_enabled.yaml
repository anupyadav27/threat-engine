title: Enable Deletion Protection for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Enabling deletion protection for Cloud SQL instances prevents accidental
  or malicious deletion of database clusters, which can lead to data loss, service
  downtime, and potential financial and reputational damage. This protection is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and ensuring business continuity, especially in environments
  where multiple users have access to infrastructure resources.
description: This rule checks if deletion protection is enabled for Cloud SQL instances.
  Deletion protection adds an additional layer of security by requiring a confirmation
  step before the instance can be deleted. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud
  Console, access the SQL section, select your instance, and ensure that deletion
  protection is toggled on. Remediation involves enabling this setting in the instance
  configuration either via the console or using gcloud command-line tools.
