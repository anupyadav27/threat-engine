title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Cloud SQL Backups
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Cloud SQL backups is essential to
  prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Sharing backups across
  accounts can expose sensitive data to unintended parties, increasing the risk of
  data exfiltration and compliance violations, particularly under regulations such
  as GDPR or HIPAA. Limiting sharing helps maintain data sovereignty and integrity,
  ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to critical backups.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow Cloud SQL database backups
  to be shared across different GCP accounts. To verify compliance, review the IAM
  policies associated with Cloud SQL backup resources and ensure that permissions
  for sharing are restricted to trusted accounts only. Remediation involves configuring
  IAM roles and policies to limit access strictly to necessary accounts, thereby reducing
  the risk of data leaks. It is advisable to audit and update these permissions regularly
  to align with the principle of least privilege.
