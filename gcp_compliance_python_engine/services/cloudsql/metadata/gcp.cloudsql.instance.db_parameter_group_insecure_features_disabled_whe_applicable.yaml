title: Disable Insecure Features in Cloud SQL DB Parameter Groups
rationale: Disabling insecure features in Cloud SQL DB parameter groups helps mitigate
  potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to compromise database
  integrity or confidentiality. This is crucial for organizations handling sensitive
  data, as it reduces the risk of data breaches and aids in compliance with regulatory
  requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether insecure features, such as unencrypted communication
  protocols and weak authentication mechanisms, are disabled in Cloud SQL DB parameter
  groups. Administrators should verify that these features are turned off by reviewing
  the DB parameter group's settings via the Cloud Console or using gcloud commands.
  Remediation involves adjusting the parameters to disable insecure options and enabling
  secure alternatives, such as SSL/TLS for data in transit and strong password policies.
