title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Have Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Cloud SQL instances protects sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and data breaches. It is crucial for maintaining data
  confidentiality and integrity, especially for workloads subject to regulatory standards
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. This measure mitigates risks associated with data theft
  or loss in case of physical or logical breaches.
description: This rule verifies that Google Cloud SQL instances have encryption at
  rest enabled. By default, Google automatically encrypts all data before it is written
  to disk using AES-256 encryption. To ensure compliance, users should verify that
  encryption settings align with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
  Remediation involves confirming the use of Google's managed encryption keys or configuring
  customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for advanced control over encryption processes.
