title: Disable Contained Database Authentication for Cloud SQL
rationale: Disabling contained database authentication for Cloud SQL instances helps
  prevent unauthorized access by ensuring that authentication is managed at the instance
  level rather than within individual databases. This reduces the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive data, aligning with compliance requirements
  for data protection and access control frameworks.
description: This rule checks if contained database authentication is disabled for
  Cloud SQL instances. Contained database authentication allows users to authenticate
  directly within a database, which can bypass centralized access controls. To ensure
  stronger security management, it is recommended to disable this feature. Verification
  can be done by checking the instance settings, and remediation involves modifying
  the instance configuration to disable contained database authentication.
