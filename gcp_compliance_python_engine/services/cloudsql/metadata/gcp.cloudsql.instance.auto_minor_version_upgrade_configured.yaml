title: Ensure Auto Minor Version Upgrade for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Configuring auto minor version upgrades for Cloud SQL instances helps maintain
  the security and stability of databases by automatically applying the latest minor
  updates and patches. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited in
  outdated database versions, which can lead to data breaches, service disruptions,
  and non-compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule verifies that auto minor version upgrades are enabled for Cloud
  SQL instances. It checks the instance configuration to ensure that the 'auto_minor_version_upgrade'
  setting is set to true. To enable this setting, navigate to the Cloud SQL instance
  settings in the Google Cloud Console, edit the instance, and enable the 'Auto Minor
  Version Upgrade' option. This ensures that your databases receive critical security
  updates automatically, minimizing manual intervention.
