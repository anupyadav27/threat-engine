title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Have Storage Encryption Enabled
rationale: Encrypting storage of Cloud SQL instances is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access, particularly in the event of a data breach or physical
  media loss. This is vital for maintaining customer trust, adhering to data privacy
  regulations such as GDPR, and fulfilling compliance requirements of standards like
  PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate encryption of data at rest.
description: This rule verifies that Cloud SQL instances have storage encryption enabled,
  ensuring data is encrypted at rest using Google-managed keys. To check, verify the
  'diskEncryptionConfiguration' parameter in the Cloud SQL instance settings. If not
  configured, enable encryption by navigating to the Cloud SQL instance settings in
  the GCP Console and selecting 'Enable Encryption' under storage options. This is
  an essential step in securing data and preventing unauthorized access.
