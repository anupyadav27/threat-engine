title: Remove Unused or Default Superusers in Cloud SQL
rationale: Leaving unused or default superuser accounts active in Cloud SQL can increase
  the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and privilege escalation. Superusers
  have elevated privileges, and if left unsecured, they can be exploited by attackers
  to gain complete control over the database. Regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA emphasize the principle of least privilege, making it essential to manage
  superuser accounts diligently.
description: This rule checks for the presence of unused or default superuser accounts
  in Cloud SQL databases. Default accounts like 'root' or other vendor-provided superusers
  should be renamed, disabled, or deleted if not required. Additionally, regularly
  review user activity logs to identify and remove unused accounts. Remediation involves
  connecting to the database and executing SQL commands to manage or delete these
  accounts, ensuring that only necessary and active superuser accounts are retained.
