title: Ensure SSL Connections for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Enforcing SSL connections for Cloud SQL instances mitigates the risk of
  data interception and unauthorized access to sensitive data during transit. This
  is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially for organizations
  handling regulated data under compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Failure
  to encrypt data in transit can lead to severe business impacts, including data breaches
  and non-compliance penalties.
description: This rule checks whether SSL connections are enforced for Cloud SQL instances.
  To verify, ensure that the 'Require SSL' option is enabled in the Cloud SQL instance
  settings. This can be done via the Google Cloud Console, gcloud command-line tool,
  or REST API. Remediation involves enabling SSL enforcement and distributing the
  necessary SSL certificates to all database clients to secure the data transmission
  between clients and the Cloud SQL instance.
