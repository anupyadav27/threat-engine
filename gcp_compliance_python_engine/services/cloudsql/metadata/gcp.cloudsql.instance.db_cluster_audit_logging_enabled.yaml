title: Ensure Cloud SQL Audit Logging is Enabled for Instances
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Cloud SQL instances is crucial for tracking
  access and changes to your database configurations and data. It helps in identifying
  unauthorized access attempts and potential malicious activities, thus safeguarding
  sensitive data and meeting compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Without
  audit logs, organizations may face challenges in forensic investigations and risk
  non-compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for Cloud SQL instances
  in your GCP environment. Audit logs provide detailed insights into who accessed
  the database, what actions were taken, and when they occurred. To verify, navigate
  to the 'Logging' section under your Cloud SQL instance settings in the GCP Console
  and ensure 'Enable audit logs' is selected. Remediation involves configuring the
  Cloud SQL instance to enable audit logging via the GCP Console or using gcloud command-line
  tools.
