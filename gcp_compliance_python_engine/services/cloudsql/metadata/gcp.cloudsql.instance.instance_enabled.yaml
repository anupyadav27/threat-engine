title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Are Enabled and Configured Correctly
rationale: Enabled Cloud SQL instances are crucial for maintaining business continuity
  and data accessibility. Disabling instances can lead to service disruption, affecting
  application availability and integrity. Properly configured instances ensure compliance
  with data protection regulations and mitigate risks of unauthorized access or data
  breaches.
description: This rule verifies that Cloud SQL instances are enabled and operational.
  It checks the 'state' attribute of each Cloud SQL instance to confirm it is not
  in a 'disabled' state, which could indicate an unintentional service interruption.
  To remediate, ensure instances are correctly started and configured using the GCP
  Console or CLI. Regularly audit instance states to prevent accidental downtime.
