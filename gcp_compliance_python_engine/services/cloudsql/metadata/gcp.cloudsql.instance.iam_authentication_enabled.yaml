title: Enable IAM Authentication for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Enabling IAM authentication for Cloud SQL instances ensures that database
  access is integrated with Google Cloud's identity management, enhancing access control
  and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. This is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data, meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, and mitigating potential
  data breaches and insider threats.
description: This rule checks if IAM authentication is enabled for Cloud SQL instances,
  which allows users to connect to databases using their Google Cloud credentials.
  To verify, inspect the instance settings in the Google Cloud Console or use the
  gcloud CLI to confirm that IAM DB authentication is activated. Remediation involves
  configuring the instance to enable IAM authentication through the Cloud SQL settings
  panel or via the gcloud sql instances patch command.
