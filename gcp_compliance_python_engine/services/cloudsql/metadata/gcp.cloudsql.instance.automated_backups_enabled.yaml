title: Enable Automated Backups for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Automated backups are crucial for protecting data against accidental deletion,
  corruption, and other forms of data loss. They ensure business continuity by allowing
  for quick data recovery, thereby minimizing downtime and potential revenue loss.
  Moreover, they are often a requirement for compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate data protection and recovery processes.
description: This rule checks if automated backups are enabled for Cloud SQL instances.
  Automated backups should be configured to occur daily to ensure data is consistently
  protected. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select the SQL instance,
  and ensure that the 'Automated backups' setting is enabled under the 'Backups' tab.
  If not enabled, adjust the settings to activate automated backups. This ensures
  that all critical data is regularly backed up and can be restored in case of failure.
