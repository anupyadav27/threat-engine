title: Enforce TLS for Cloud SQL Instance Connections
rationale: Requiring TLS for Cloud SQL instances ensures data is encrypted in transit,
  protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping. This is crucial
  for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, meeting compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, and upholding customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that Cloud SQL instances are configured to enforce
  TLS for all incoming connections. Administrators should enable 'require SSL' settings
  to ensure encrypted connections, thus safeguarding sensitive data against interception
  during transit. Verification can be done via the GCP Console or CLI by checking
  the instance's connection settings. Remediation involves updating the instance configuration
  to enforce SSL connections.
