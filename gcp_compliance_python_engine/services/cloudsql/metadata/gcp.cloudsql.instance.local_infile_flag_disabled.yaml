title: Ensure Local Infile Flag is Disabled on Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Disabling the local infile flag in Cloud SQL prevents unauthorized data
  import operations, reducing the risk of data exfiltration and malicious data manipulation.
  This control is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data,
  especially for organizations that must adhere to stringent data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks if the local infile flag is disabled on Cloud SQL instances,
  which is necessary to prevent potential security vulnerabilities associated with
  data import operations. To verify compliance, review the database flags in the Cloud
  SQL instance settings and ensure 'local_infile' is set to 'OFF'. Remediation involves
  configuring the database flags accordingly via the GCP Console or gcloud command-line
  tool.
