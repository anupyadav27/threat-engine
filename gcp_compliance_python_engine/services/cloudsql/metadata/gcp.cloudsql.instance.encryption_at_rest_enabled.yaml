title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Have Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Cloud SQL instances is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It mitigates
  risks associated with data theft or exposure in cases of physical storage compromise.
  Compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOC2 often mandates encryption
  at rest for safeguarding sensitive information.
description: This rule checks that all Cloud SQL instances have encryption at rest
  enabled by utilizing Google-managed keys or customer-managed keys. Verify this setting
  by accessing the Cloud SQL instance settings in the Google Cloud Console or using
  the gcloud CLI. To remediate, ensure that each Cloud SQL instance has the 'Enable
  Encryption at Rest' option checked during creation or update the instance to enable
  this option.
