title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances are Configured for Multi-AZ Deployment
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ deployment for Cloud SQL instances is crucial for high
  availability and fault tolerance, minimizing downtime risk. This configuration helps
  protect against zone failures and ensures continuous database service, which is
  vital for business continuity and meeting SLAs. It also supports compliance with
  regulations requiring robust disaster recovery plans.
description: This rule checks if Cloud SQL instances have Multi-AZ configuration enabled,
  meaning they are deployed across multiple availability zones. Multi-AZ deployment
  allows automatic failover to a standby instance in a different zone in case of a
  failure. To verify, review the instance settings in the Google Cloud Console or
  use the gcloud CLI. Remediation involves modifying the instance to enable high availability
  settings, which can be done during instance creation or via configuration updates.
