title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Have Backups Enabled
rationale: Enabling backups for Cloud SQL instances is crucial for data resilience
  and disaster recovery. Without regular backups, you risk data loss in events such
  as accidental deletions, data corruption, or system failures. This practice supports
  business continuity and meets compliance requirements like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001,
  which mandate data protection measures.
description: This rule checks if automatic backups are enabled for Cloud SQL instances.
  Backups provide a point-in-time snapshot of the database, which is essential for
  restoring data in case of incidents. To verify, navigate to the Cloud SQL instances
  page in the GCP Console and ensure that automatic backups are enabled under the
  'Backups' section. Remediation involves configuring a backup schedule and enabling
  automatic backups through the console or using gcloud CLI commands.
