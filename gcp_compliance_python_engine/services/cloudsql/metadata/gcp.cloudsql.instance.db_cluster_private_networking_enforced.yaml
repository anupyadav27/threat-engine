title: Ensure Cloud SQL Instances Use Private IP Networking
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Cloud SQL instances mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access by ensuring that databases are accessible only through private
  IPs within a VPC. This reduces attack surface and aligns with compliance requirements
  like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate secure access controls for sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if Cloud SQL instances are configured to use private
  IP addresses within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). By default, instances may be
  accessible over the public internet, increasing exposure to potential attacks. To
  remediate, enable private IP for the SQL instances under the 'Connections' settings
  in the Google Cloud Console, ensuring they are only accessible within authorized
  VPC networks.
