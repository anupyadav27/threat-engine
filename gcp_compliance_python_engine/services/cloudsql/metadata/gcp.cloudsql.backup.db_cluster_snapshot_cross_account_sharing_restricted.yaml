title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Cloud SQL Backups
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Cloud SQL backups is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive database content, which can lead to data breaches
  and compromise business operations. This control ensures that backups are only accessible
  by authorized accounts, mitigating risks of accidental exposure and aligning with
  compliance standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if Cloud SQL backups are shared across different GCP
  accounts without explicit authorization. Ensure that all snapshots are configured
  to deny access to external accounts unless explicitly required for business processes.
  To verify, review the IAM policies and permissions on Cloud SQL backups and ensure
  they are restricted to necessary accounts only. If cross-account access is detected,
  adjust the IAM settings to limit access to authorized users and accounts.
