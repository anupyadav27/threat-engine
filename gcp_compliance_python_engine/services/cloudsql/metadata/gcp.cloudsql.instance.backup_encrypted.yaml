title: Ensure Cloud SQL Backups are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting backups of Cloud SQL instances at rest protects sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of data, meeting regulatory compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, and mitigating risks associated with data leaks
  or theft.
description: This rule checks whether backups for Cloud SQL instances are encrypted
  using Google-managed or customer-managed keys. To verify, navigate to the Cloud
  SQL instance settings in the GCP Console and ensure the 'Backups' section indicates
  that encryption is enabled. Remediation involves configuring encryption settings
  during the creation of the instance or by updating existing instances to use encrypted
  backups.
