title: Ensure Log Min Error Statement Configured for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Configuring the 'log_min_error_statement' setting in Cloud SQL ensures
  that all error statements meeting or exceeding a specified severity level are logged.
  This helps in early detection of potential issues, supports forensic investigations,
  and adheres to compliance regulations like PCI-DSS and SOC2 that require detailed
  error logging for auditing purposes.
description: This rule checks whether the 'log_min_error_statement' configuration
  is set appropriately on Cloud SQL instances to log minimum error statements. Proper
  configuration involves setting the parameter to a severity level (e.g., ERROR, WARNING)
  that aligns with your organization's logging policy. To verify, access the Cloud
  SQL instance settings in the GCP Console, navigate to 'Flags', and ensure 'log_min_error_statement'
  is configured. Remediation involves setting this flag to a suitable level and applying
  the changes.
