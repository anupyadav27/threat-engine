subcategory: backup_configuration
severity: critical
title: Prevent Public Sharing of Cloud SQL Backup Snapshots
rationale: Publicly shared database backups can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  parties, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA. Properly securing these backups is critical to maintaining
  data integrity and ensuring that disaster recovery processes do not inadvertently
  lead to data leaks.
description: This rule checks that Cloud SQL database cluster snapshots are not publicly
  shared. Public access to backups can be controlled by reviewing and configuring
  access policies in the Cloud SQL instance settings. To remediate, ensure that IAM
  policies do not grant public access to these resources and regularly audit permissions
  to maintain compliance.
