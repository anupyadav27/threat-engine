title: Enable IAM or Managed Identity Auth for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Enabling IAM or managed identity authentication for Cloud SQL instances
  enhances security by leveraging GCP's identity management capabilities. This reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access through better control and auditing of database
  access. It also aligns with compliance standards that require strict access management
  and audit trails for sensitive data stored in databases.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud SQL instances have IAM or managed identity
  authentication enabled, which is crucial for securely managing database access.
  To verify, ensure that Cloud SQL instances are configured to use Cloud IAM or Managed
  Identity for database authentication. Remediation involves updating the database
  settings to enable these authentication methods, thereby improving access control
  and monitoring capabilities.
