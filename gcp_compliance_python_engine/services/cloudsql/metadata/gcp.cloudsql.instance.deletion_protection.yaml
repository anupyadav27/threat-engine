title: Enable Deletion Protection for Cloud SQL Instances
rationale: Deletion protection prevents accidental or malicious deletion of Cloud
  SQL instances, which can lead to data loss and service disruption. This feature
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability, especially for instances
  containing critical business or customer data. Compliance with data protection regulations
  may also necessitate safeguarding data against unintended deletions.
description: This rule checks if deletion protection is enabled on Cloud SQL instances.
  Deletion protection is a setting that prevents the instance from being deleted via
  the console, gcloud command-line tool, or API. To verify, ensure the 'deletionProtection'
  field is set to true in the instance configuration. Remediation involves updating
  the instance settings to enable deletion protection using the Cloud Console, gcloud
  command-line tool, or REST API.
