title: Ensure Cloud SQL Remote Access is Securely Configured
rationale: Improper configuration of remote access settings in Cloud SQL can expose
  databases to unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or loss. Configuring
  remote access controls helps in mitigating risks associated with unauthorized data
  exposure and ensures compliance with data protection regulations such as PCI-DSS
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if Cloud SQL instances have the 'allow only SSL connections'
  flag enabled, ensuring that all remote connections use SSL encryption. To verify,
  navigate to the Cloud SQL instance settings in the GCP Console and confirm that
  the 'Require SSL' option is activated under 'Connections'. To remediate, enable
  SSL enforcement and configure SSL certificates for client connections. This enhances
  data security by encrypting data in transit.
