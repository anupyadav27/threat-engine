title: Ensure Essential Contacts Coverage for Org Notifications
rationale: Proper coverage of essential contacts for organization notifications in
  GCP is crucial to ensure timely communication of security alerts and compliance
  updates. Lacking coverage can result in missed notifications about critical events
  or policy changes, potentially leading to security breaches or compliance violations.
  This is especially important for maintaining organizational resilience and meeting
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether all relevant notification categories are covered
  by essential contacts within your GCP organization. Specifically, it verifies that
  contacts are configured to receive notifications related to security and compliance.
  To remediate, ensure that each notification category within the essential contacts
  settings is assigned to an appropriate contact with the correct email address. This
  can be configured in the GCP Console under the Essential Contacts section of your
  organization's IAM settings.
