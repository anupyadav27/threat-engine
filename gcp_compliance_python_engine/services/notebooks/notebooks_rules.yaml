# CURSOR AI: GCP SERVICE VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================
# 
# 🎯 YOUR MISSION: Validate and fix this GCP service YAML file
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. Read this entire YAML file structure
# 2. Run: `export GCP_ENGINE_FILTER_SERVICES="<SERVICE>" && python engine/gcp_engine.py > output/test_<service>.json 2>&1`
# 3. Analyze output - check for inventories, main_checks, errors
# 4. Fix issues in discovery and checks sections below
# 5. Re-run engine and verify output
# 6. Iterate until all checks work (PASS/FAIL based on resources)
# 7. Update validation status at bottom of file
#
# COMMON ISSUES & FIXES:
#
# ❌ Empty inventories → Fix discovery action (must be: list_<resource>, aggregatedList_<resource>)
# ❌ Zero checks executed → Fix for_each to match discovery_id
# ❌ All checks fail → Fix field paths to match GCP API response
# ❌ Skipped checks → Verify discovery_id exists and completed
# ❌ Python errors → Check YAML syntax, action names
#
# TESTING:
# - Run engine: `export GCP_ENGINE_FILTER_SERVICES="<service>" && python engine/gcp_engine.py > output/test.json 2>&1`
# - Check output: `cat output/test.json | python3 -m json.tool`
# - Verify: inventories array has resources, main_checks array has results
#
# SUCCESS CRITERIA:
# ✅ Engine runs without Python exceptions
# ✅ Inventories populated (if resources exist in GCP)
# ✅ All checks execute (PASS/FAIL based on actual resource state)
# ✅ No skipped checks (unless expected)
# ✅ Clean JSON output
#
# DOCUMENTATION:
# After fixing, update validation section at bottom:
# # VALIDATION STATUS:
# # - Issues Found: <what was wrong>
# # - Fixes Applied: <what you fixed>
# # - Tested: <date>
# # - Inventories: <count>
# # - Checks: <count executed>
# # - Status: ✅ VALIDATED / ⏳ IN PROGRESS / ❌ NEEDS WORK
