subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Notebook Execution Role
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to AI Notebook execution roles
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Misconfigured roles
  can lead to excessive permissions, exposing sensitive data and potentially violating
  compliance mandates like GDPR and HIPAA. This is critical for protecting intellectual
  property and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks that AI Notebook execution roles are configured with
  only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. To verify, review attached
  IAM policies for roles assigned to notebook instances and ensure no additional permissions
  are granted beyond what is strictly needed. Remediate by adjusting the IAM policies
  to remove any superfluous permissions, and implement role-based access controls
  (RBAC) to further restrict access.
