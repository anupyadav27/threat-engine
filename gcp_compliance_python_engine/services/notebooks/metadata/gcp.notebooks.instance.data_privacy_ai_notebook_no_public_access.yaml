subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: critical
title: Disable Public Access to AI Notebooks for Data Privacy
rationale: Allowing public access to AI Notebooks can expose sensitive data and intellectual
  property to unauthorized users, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Publicly accessible notebooks
  may inadvertently allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, leading to potential
  data exfiltration or service disruption.
description: This rule checks if AI Notebooks have public IP addresses assigned, which
  can expose them to the internet. Ensure that AI Notebooks are configured with private
  IP addresses or behind a secure VPN. Verify by reviewing the notebook's network
  settings via the GCP console or using the `gcloud` CLI. Remediate by updating the
  notebook's network configuration to restrict access to trusted networks only.
