severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Notebooks Have Encryption at Rest Enabled
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in AI Notebooks reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. It provides a layer of protection against threats such
  as data theft and accidental exposure, and helps comply with regulations like GDPR,
  HIPAA, and ISO 27001 that mandate data protection and privacy.
description: This rule checks if AI Notebook instances in GCP have encryption at rest
  enabled. Ensure that all sensitive data stored in notebooks is encrypted using either
  Google-managed keys or customer-managed keys (CMEK) for additional control. To verify,
  check the encryption configuration in the AI Notebook's settings. Remediate by enabling
  encryption at rest through the GCP Console or using the gcloud CLI, specifying the
  appropriate key management option.
