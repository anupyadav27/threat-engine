subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Restrict Public Access to AI Notebooks
rationale: Allowing public access to AI Notebooks can lead to unauthorized data exposure,
  potential data breaches, and misuse of computational resources. This poses significant
  risks, especially in environments handling sensitive data, as it can lead to non-compliance
  with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, resulting in financial penalties
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks for AI Notebook instances in GCP that are publicly accessible
  over the internet. Public access should be disabled by setting appropriate IAM policies
  that restrict access only to authorized users within the organization. Ensure firewall
  rules are configured to block public IPs and that access is granted through VPNs
  or private endpoints. Regularly audit access logs for any unauthorized access attempts.
