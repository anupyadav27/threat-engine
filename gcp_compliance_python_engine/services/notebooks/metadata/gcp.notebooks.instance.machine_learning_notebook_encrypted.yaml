title: Ensure Encryption of Machine Learning Notebooks at Rest
rationale: Encrypting machine learning notebooks at rest protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access, minimizing the risk of data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining
  customer trust and complying with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  Failure to encrypt these assets could result in exposure of proprietary algorithms
  and datasets, leading to significant business and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if Machine Learning Notebooks in GCP are encrypted at
  rest using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) or Google-managed keys. To verify,
  ensure the 'encryptionConfig' field is set for each notebook instance. Remediation
  involves configuring encryption settings during instance creation or updating existing
  instances to enforce encryption policies. This step is vital to safeguard data against
  unauthorized access and meet compliance requirements.
