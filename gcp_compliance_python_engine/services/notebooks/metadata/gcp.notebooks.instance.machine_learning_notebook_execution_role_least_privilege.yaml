service: notebooks
resource: instance
requirement: Machine Learning Notebook Execution Role Least Privilege
scope: notebooks.instance.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for ML Notebook Execution Roles
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to machine learning notebook
  execution roles minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. With
  excessive privileges, compromised accounts can lead to lateral movement and data
  exfiltration. This practice is essential for meeting compliance requirements such
  as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate strict access controls.
description: This rule checks whether machine learning notebook execution roles in
  GCP are configured with the least privilege necessary. Review the roles assigned
  to instances to ensure they only have permissions required for their specific tasks.
  Remediate by auditing IAM policies and removing unnecessary permissions, following
  the principle of least privilege. Validate configurations using the IAM section
  of the GCP Console or via the gcloud command-line tool.
