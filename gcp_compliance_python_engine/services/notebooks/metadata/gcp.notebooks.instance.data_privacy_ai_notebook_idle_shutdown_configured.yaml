title: Configure Idle Shutdown for AI Notebooks to Protect Data
rationale: Configuring idle shutdown for AI Notebooks helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access and reduces cost by ensuring that resources are not left running unnecessarily.
  This is critical in protecting sensitive data, as idle notebooks can be exploited
  if left unattended. Compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, necessitates minimizing the exposure of data through idle compute resources.
description: This check verifies that AI Notebooks have idle shutdown configured to
  automatically power down after a period of inactivity. To ensure this, set the 'idle_shutdown'
  and 'idle_shutdown_timeout' parameters within the notebook's metadata. Verification
  involves reviewing the notebook's metadata settings for these parameters. Remediation
  includes specifying an appropriate timeout duration in the GCP Console or using
  gcloud commands to update existing notebooks.
