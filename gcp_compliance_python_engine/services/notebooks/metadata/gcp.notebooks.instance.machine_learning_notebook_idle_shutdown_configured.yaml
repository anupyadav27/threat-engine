title: Configure Idle Shutdown for ML Notebooks
rationale: Unattended machine learning notebooks can lead to unnecessary cloud resource
  consumption, increased costs, and potential exposure to unauthorized access. Configuring
  idle shutdown helps mitigate these risks by ensuring that notebooks are not left
  running without supervision, aligning with cost management and security best practices.
description: This rule checks whether machine learning notebooks on Google Cloud Platform
  have idle shutdown configured. Idle shutdown ensures that notebooks automatically
  stop after a specified period of inactivity, reducing the attack surface and optimizing
  resource usage. Verify by checking the notebook instance settings and ensure the
  'idle shutdown' feature is enabled with an appropriate timeout period. Remediation
  involves accessing the notebook's configuration and setting the 'idle shutdown'
  parameter to a suitable timeout value based on organizational policies.
