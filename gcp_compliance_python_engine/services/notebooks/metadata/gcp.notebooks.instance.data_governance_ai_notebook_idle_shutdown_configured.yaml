title: Configure Idle Shutdown for AI Notebook Instances
rationale: Ensuring that idle AI Notebook instances are automatically shut down helps
  reduce unnecessary resource consumption and minimizes the risk of data exposure.
  Unattended instances may lead to unauthorized access or data leaks, impacting business
  operations and compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether AI Notebook instances in GCP have idle shutdown
  configurations enabled. To mitigate security risks and optimize resource use, configure
  the idle shutdown feature by setting an appropriate timeout. Verification involves
  ensuring that the 'idle_shutdown' setting is enabled and configured with a reasonable
  duration. Remediate by accessing the AI Notebook instance settings and setting an
  idle shutdown timeout under the 'Environment' options in the GCP Console.
