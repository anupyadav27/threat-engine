service: notebooks
resource: instance
requirement: Data Privacy Ai Notebook Execution Role Least Privilege
scope: notebooks.instance.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Notebook Execution Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI Notebook execution roles minimizes
  the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access. Overly permissive roles can lead
  to data breaches, non-compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, and potential
  financial loss due to data misuse. Ensuring roles have only necessary permissions
  protects sensitive data and aligns with best practices in access management.
description: This rule checks that AI Notebook instances in GCP are assigned execution
  roles with the minimum set of permissions needed to perform their functions. Review
  current role assignments on notebook instances and adjust the IAM policies to restrict
  permissions to only those necessary. Remediation involves using IAM policy bindings
  to assign roles at the granularity level required, avoiding overly broad roles like
  'Owner' or 'Editor'. Verify by auditing the IAM roles attached to notebook instances
  and ensuring compliance with the principle of least privilege.
