service: notebooks
resource: instance
requirement: Data Governance Ai Notebook Encrypted
scope: notebooks.instance.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure AI Notebook Instances are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting AI Notebook instances protects sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and data breaches, which can lead to significant business losses and compliance
  violations. This is crucial for safeguarding intellectual property and meeting regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection measures.
description: This rule checks that AI Notebook instances in GCP are configured to
  use encryption at rest, leveraging Google-managed encryption keys or customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) for enhanced security. To verify, ensure that the 'encryptionConfig'
  field is set within the instance's configuration. Remediation involves enabling
  encryption by configuring the notebook instance to use either default Google-managed
  keys or specifying a CMEK during instance creation or update.
