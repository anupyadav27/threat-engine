requirement: Machine Learning Notebook No Public Access

subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Disable Public Access for ML Notebooks Instances
rationale: Allowing public access to Machine Learning Notebooks can expose sensitive
  data and computational resources to unauthorized users, increasing the risk of data
  breaches and misuse of resources. Ensuring notebooks are not publicly accessible
  helps comply with security best practices and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, by protecting data confidentiality and integrity.
description: This rule checks if any Google Cloud Machine Learning Notebook instances
  are configured with public access. To secure the environment, verify that all notebook
  instances are restricted to private IPs or specific trusted networks. Remediation
  involves modifying the instance's network settings to disable public IPs and using
  IAM to restrict access to authorized users only.
