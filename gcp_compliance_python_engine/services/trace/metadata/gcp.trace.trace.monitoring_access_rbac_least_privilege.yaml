title: Enforce Least Privilege for Trace Monitoring Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Trace monitoring access reduces the risk
  of unauthorized data exposure and insider threats, ensuring that only necessary
  personnel can view or manipulate trace data. This aligns with compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate access controls to safeguard sensitive
  information.
description: This rule checks whether Trace monitoring access follows the principle
  of least privilege by reviewing IAM roles assigned to users. It verifies that only
  essential personnel have roles like 'roles/cloudtrace.agent'. To remediate, audit
  your IAM policies, remove excessive permissions, and restrict access to only those
  roles necessary for performing specific tasks. Regularly review and update permissions
  to adapt to evolving organizational needs.
