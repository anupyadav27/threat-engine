title: Ensure Cloud Trace Monitoring Data is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting monitoring data at rest in Cloud Trace protects sensitive information
  from unauthorized access. This is vital for maintaining the confidentiality and
  integrity of trace data, which may contain insights into application performance
  and potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, data encryption helps meet compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, reducing the risk of data breaches and associated
  legal penalties.
description: This rule checks that all monitoring data stored by Google Cloud Trace
  is encrypted at rest using Google-managed keys. To verify, ensure that the default
  encryption settings are enabled for Cloud Trace in the Google Cloud Console. Remediation
  involves enabling encryption settings in the Cloud Trace configuration if they are
  not already active. Use Google Cloud's built-in encryption capabilities to secure
  your trace data effectively.
