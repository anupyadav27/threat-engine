title: Disable Inactive Identity Access After 90 Days
rationale: Inactive identities pose a security risk as they can be exploited by unauthorized
  users to gain access to sensitive systems. Regularly disabling inactive accounts
  reduces the potential attack surface and helps organizations comply with regulatory
  standards like NIST and ISO 27001 which mandate secure management of user identities.
description: This rule checks if user accounts in Google Cloud Identity have been
  inactive for over 90 days and ensures they are disabled. Inactive accounts are those
  that have not been logged into or used for any activities. Administrators can verify
  account activity through the Google Cloud Console under the 'Identity' section and
  disable inactive accounts manually or automate the process using identity management
  tools. Ensuring accounts are disabled after a period of inactivity mitigates the
  risk of unauthorized access.
