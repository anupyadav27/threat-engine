title: Enable Identity Access Membership Review in Cloud Identity Groups
rationale: Enabling identity access membership review helps to ensure that only authorized
  users have access to sensitive resources, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. This practice supports compliance with regulations
  by maintaining up-to-date access controls and auditing capabilities, enhancing the
  organization's security posture.
description: This rule checks if identity access membership review is enabled for
  Cloud Identity groups where supported. Regular reviews of group memberships are
  crucial to verify that users' access levels align with their current roles and responsibilities.
  To enable this, navigate to the Cloud Identity console, select the group, and configure
  the membership settings to require periodic reviews. Remediation involves setting
  an appropriate review frequency and ensuring responsible parties are notified of
  upcoming reviews.
