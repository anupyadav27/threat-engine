title: Enforce MFA for Cloud Identity Membership Access
rationale: Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all members of Cloud Identity
  ensures that unauthorized access through compromised credentials is mitigated, reducing
  the risk of data breaches. This is critical for protecting sensitive information
  and ensuring compliance with security regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which
  mandate strong authentication mechanisms.
description: This rule checks whether all members in Cloud Identity have MFA enabled
  to access resources. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide
  two or more verification factors. To verify compliance, audit the identity provider
  settings or use the Google Cloud Console to ensure MFA is enforced. If MFA is not
  enabled, configure identity policies to require it for all users accessing the Cloud
  Identity services.
