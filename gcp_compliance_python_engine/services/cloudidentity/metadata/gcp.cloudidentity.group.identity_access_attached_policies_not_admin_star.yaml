title: Restrict Admin * Policies on Cloud Identity Groups
rationale: Ensuring that Cloud Identity groups do not have overly permissive admin
  policies is crucial to maintaining the principle of least privilege. Overly broad
  permissions can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, impacting
  the organization's security posture and compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS
  and SOC2.
description: This rule checks for Cloud Identity groups with attached policies that
  include administrative access ('admin' roles with '*') which may grant excessive
  permissions. Administrators should review and revise these policies to ensure they
  align with the principle of least privilege. Remediation involves auditing the policies
  attached to each group and removing or constraining permissions that are too broad.
