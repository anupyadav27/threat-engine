title: Ensure Access Keys Are Rotated Every 90 Days
rationale: Regular rotation of access keys mitigates the risk of credential compromise,
  which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This practice supports
  compliance with industry standards such as NIST and ISO 27001, reducing the risk
  of data breaches and ensuring a strong security posture against credential-based
  attacks.
description: This rule checks whether access keys associated with Cloud Identity memberships
  have been rotated within the past 90 days. Regularly rotating access keys reduces
  the window of opportunity for malicious actors to exploit compromised credentials.
  To verify compliance, review the access key creation or last rotation dates within
  the Cloud Console or via the command line. Remediation involves scheduling regular
  key rotations and implementing automated notifications for keys nearing the rotation
  threshold.
