service: cloudidentity
resource: membership
requirement: Identity Access Console Password Present Only If Required
scope: cloudidentity.membership.security
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Console Passwords Set Only When Necessary
rationale: Unnecessary console passwords increase the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. In environments where they are not required, they can
  introduce vulnerabilities that bypass more secure authentication methods. Minimizing
  password use aligns with least privilege principles and helps comply with regulations
  like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, reducing attack surfaces and improving overall security
  posture.
description: This rule checks that Identity Access Console passwords are present only
  when explicitly required for operational purposes. It ensures that console access
  is secured using alternative, more secure authentication methods like OAuth or SAML
  where possible. To verify, audit the membership settings in Cloud Identity to ensure
  that passwords are not set unless justified. If passwords are found without necessity,
  remove them and implement stronger authentication mechanisms.
