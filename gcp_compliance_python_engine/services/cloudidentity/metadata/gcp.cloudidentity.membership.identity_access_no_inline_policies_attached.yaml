title: Prevent Inline Policies on Cloud Identity Memberships
rationale: Attaching inline policies directly to Cloud Identity memberships can lead
  to inconsistent and difficult-to-manage access controls. This increases the risk
  of unintentional privilege escalation and makes it challenging to audit and comply
  with regulatory standards such as NIST and ISO 27001. By avoiding inline policies,
  organizations can ensure a more streamlined and secure access management strategy.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline policies directly attached
  to Cloud Identity memberships. Inline policies can lead to security risks by creating
  policy sprawl and making it difficult to maintain proper access controls. To verify,
  review membership configurations and ensure policies are attached through managed
  roles instead. Remediate by detaching inline policies and applying necessary permissions
  via predefined roles in IAM to improve manageability and security.
