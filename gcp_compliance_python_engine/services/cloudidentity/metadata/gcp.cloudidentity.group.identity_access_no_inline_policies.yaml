title: Ensure No Inline Policies on Cloud Identity Groups
rationale: Inline policies directly attached to Cloud Identity Groups can lead to
  hidden permissions that are difficult to track and audit, increasing the risk of
  unauthorized access. By enforcing centralized policy management through IAM roles,
  organizations can better adhere to compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO
  27001, and reduce the attack surface by ensuring consistent access controls.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline policies directly attached
  to Cloud Identity Groups, which can bypass the standard IAM roles and permissions
  model. Inline policies should be avoided to simplify policy management and auditing.
  Remediation involves transitioning any inline policies to managed IAM roles and
  ensuring that all permissions are granted through these roles. Verification can
  be done by reviewing the configuration of Cloud Identity Groups and ensuring no
  inline policies are present.
