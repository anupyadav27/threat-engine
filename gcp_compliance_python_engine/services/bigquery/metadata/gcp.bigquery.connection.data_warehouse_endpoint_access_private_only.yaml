service: bigquery
resource: connection
requirement: Data Warehouse Endpoint Access Private Only
scope: bigquery.connection.private_networking
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Restrict BigQuery Connections to Private Networks Only
rationale: Limiting BigQuery connections to private networks reduces exposure to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This approach aligns with best practices for
  network security by minimizing attack surfaces and ensuring data is only accessible
  through secure, controlled environments. It is critical for compliance with regulations
  that require safeguarding data through restricted network access.
description: This rule checks if all BigQuery connections are configured to use private
  networking, ensuring that data access is restricted to approved private endpoints.
  To verify, review the network settings in the BigQuery console to confirm the 'Private
  Service Connect' option is enabled. Remediation involves updating connections to
  use private endpoints, minimizing external network exposure.
