title: Require SSO for BigQuery Dataset Access
rationale: Requiring Single Sign-On (SSO) for BigQuery dataset access enhances security
  by ensuring that user identities are verified through a centralized authentication
  service. This mitigates risks such as unauthorized access due to compromised credentials
  and reduces the attack surface by managing access through a single point of enforcement.
  It also helps organizations comply with identity and access management requirements
  in compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks whether Single Sign-On (SSO) is enforced for accessing
  BigQuery datasets. To verify, ensure that all dataset access entries are configured
  to authenticate through an enterprise SSO provider. Remediate by integrating GCP
  IAM policies with your organization's Identity Provider (IdP) to enforce SSO. Update
  IAM roles and permissions to align with the centralized authentication strategy,
  minimizing direct assignments of roles to users and leveraging group-based access.
