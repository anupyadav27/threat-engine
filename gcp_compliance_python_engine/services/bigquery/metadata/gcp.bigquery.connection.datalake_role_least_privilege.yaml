rule_id: gcp.bigquery.connection.datalake_role_least_privilege
service: bigquery
resource: connection
requirement: Datalake Role Least Privilege
scope: bigquery.connection.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure BigQuery Connections Use Least Privilege Roles
rationale: Restricting roles to the least privilege necessary reduces the risk of
  unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. Over-privileged roles can
  lead to inadvertent data exposure, impacting business confidentiality and compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that BigQuery connections are assigned the minimal roles
  necessary to perform their functions. Review and adjust IAM policies to ensure roles
  do not exceed the required permissions. Use predefined roles where possible and
  customize only when necessary to align with least privilege principles. Regular
  audits and updates of permissions should be conducted to adapt to changing requirements
  and threats.
