title: Ensure BigQuery Routines Use SSL for Data Warehouse Access
rationale: Requiring SSL for BigQuery routines accessing data warehouses protects
  data in transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This practice
  is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially when
  handling sensitive or regulated data. It aligns with compliance requirements like
  GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS that mandate secure data transmission.
description: This rule checks if BigQuery routines are configured to use SSL when
  accessing data warehouses. SSL ensures encrypted connections, protecting data from
  interception during transmission. To verify, inspect routine settings in BigQuery
  to ensure SSL is enforced. Remediation involves modifying routine configurations
  to mandate SSL usage, which can be done via the GCP Console or by updating routine
  definitions using SQL scripts.
