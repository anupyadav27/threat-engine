title: Ensure Least Privilege for BigQuery Dataset Admin Access
rationale: Over-provisioned access to BigQuery datasets can lead to unauthorized data
  exposure and manipulation, potentially resulting in data breaches and regulatory
  compliance failures (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Minimizing access rights to only what is
  necessary reduces the attack surface and helps prevent both insider and external
  threats.
description: This rule verifies that the IAM roles associated with BigQuery datasets
  are configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it checks
  for and flags overly permissive roles like 'roles/bigquery.admin' assigned at the
  dataset level. Remediation involves auditing existing permissions, removing unnecessary
  roles, and using predefined roles such as 'roles/bigquery.dataEditor' or custom
  roles tailored to specific user needs to limit access appropriately.
