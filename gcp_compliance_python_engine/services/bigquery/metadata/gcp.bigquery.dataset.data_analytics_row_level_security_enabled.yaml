title: Enable Row-Level Security for BigQuery Datasets
rationale: Enabling row-level security in BigQuery datasets is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data by restricting access to specific rows based on user roles. This
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure and helps meet compliance requirements
  like HIPAA and GDPR, which mandate strict data access controls.
description: This rule checks if row-level security is enabled for BigQuery datasets,
  ensuring that access to data is controlled at a granular level. To verify, examine
  the dataset's access policies to see if row-level access controls are configured.
  Remediation involves setting up appropriate row-level security policies using GCP's
  BigQuery interface or API, ensuring that only authorized users can view specific
  data rows.
