title: Enforce Datalake Private Networking for BigQuery Connections
rationale: Enforcing private networking for BigQuery connections mitigates the risk
  of data exposure by restricting access to internal networks, reducing the attack
  surface for unauthorized access. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity
  and confidentiality, especially in environments handling sensitive or regulated
  data. Compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA often requires stringent
  network access controls to prevent unauthorized data access.
description: This rule checks if BigQuery connections are configured to use private
  networking, ensuring that data interactions occur within the confines of a secure,
  internal network. To verify compliance, inspect the BigQuery connection settings
  to confirm that private IP is enforced. Remediation involves updating the connection
  settings to enforce private networking through the use of VPC Service Controls and
  private Google access. This configuration helps maintain a secure data environment
  by limiting exposure to the public internet.
