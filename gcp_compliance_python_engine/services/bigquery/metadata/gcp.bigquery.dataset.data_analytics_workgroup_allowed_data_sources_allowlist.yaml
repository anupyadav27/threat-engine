requirement: Data Analytics Workgroup Allowed Data Sources Allowlist

domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Restrict Data Analytics Workgroup to Approved BigQuery Data Sources
rationale: Allowing unrestricted data source access can lead to unauthorized data
  exposure and breaches. Limiting access to predefined data sources mitigates the
  risk of data leakage and ensures compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA
  by enforcing strict data governance and control.
description: "This rule checks if BigQuery datasets accessed by the Data Analytics\
  \ Workgroup are limited to a specific allowlist of data sources. Verify that the\
  \ IAM policies and access configurations for the datasets are set to restrict access\
  \ only to datasets approved by your organization\u2019s data governance policies.\
  \ To remediate, configure IAM roles and permissions to enforce access only to the\
  \ allowed data sources, thereby ensuring data integrity and compliance with internal\
  \ policies."
