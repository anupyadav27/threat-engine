resource: connection
requirement: Data Warehouse Hsm Client Cert Key Length Minimum
scope: bigquery.connection.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure HSM Client Cert Key Length Meets Minimum Requirements
rationale: Using a minimum key length for HSM client certificates in BigQuery connections
  ensures robust encryption, protecting sensitive data against brute-force attacks.
  Shorter key lengths can expose data to unauthorized access, which may lead to data
  breaches and violate compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that the HSM client certificate key length for BigQuery
  connections is at least 2048 bits. To verify, review the key length configuration
  in the BigQuery connection settings. If the key length is shorter, regenerate the
  certificate with a compliant key length and update the connection configuration
  accordingly.
