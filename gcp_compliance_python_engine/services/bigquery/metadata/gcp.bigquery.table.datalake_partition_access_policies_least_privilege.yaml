title: Ensure Least Privilege for BigQuery Table Partition Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access policies for BigQuery table partitions
  reduces the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data leaks. By minimizing
  permissions, organizations can mitigate insider threats and comply with regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA that mandate strict access controls on sensitive
  data.
description: This rule checks that access to BigQuery table partitions is restricted
  based on the principle of least privilege. Ensure that only necessary roles are
  granted to users or service accounts accessing table partitions. Regularly audit
  and review IAM policies to remove excessive permissions. Utilize GCP's IAM policy
  analysis tools to identify and remediate over-privileged access.
