title: Enforce Private Networking for BigQuery Data Warehouse Clusters
rationale: Ensuring that BigQuery data warehouse clusters are configured with private
  networking mitigates the risk of unauthorized access over the public internet. This
  configuration helps protect sensitive data from exposure and is crucial for compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection
  measures. By restricting access to private IP addresses, organizations can better
  manage network traffic and reduce the attack surface.
description: This rule verifies that BigQuery datasets designated as data warehouses
  are configured to enforce private networking. Specifically, this involves ensuring
  that the datasets are only accessible via internal IP addresses and not exposed
  to the public internet. To verify compliance, check the dataset's network configuration
  in the GCP Console or via the gcloud CLI, ensuring that 'privateServiceConnect'
  is enabled. Remediation involves updating the dataset's networking settings to restrict
  access only to the private network.
