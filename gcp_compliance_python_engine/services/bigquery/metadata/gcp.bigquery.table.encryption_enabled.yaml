title: Ensure BigQuery Table Encryption at Rest
rationale: Encrypting BigQuery tables at rest mitigates the risk of unauthorized data
  access and data breaches, which can have significant business and reputational impacts.
  It is crucial for meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS,
  which mandate encryption of sensitive data to protect user privacy and integrity.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for BigQuery tables, ensuring
  that all data stored is encrypted using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that BigQuery tables are configured with the appropriate
  encryption settings in the GCP Console or via the bq command-line tool. If encryption
  is not enabled, configure the tables using default Google-managed keys or specify
  customer-managed keys for enhanced control.
