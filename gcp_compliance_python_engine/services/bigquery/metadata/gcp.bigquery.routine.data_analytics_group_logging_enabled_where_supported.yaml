title: Enable Logging for BigQuery Routines in Data Analytics Group
rationale: Enabling logging for BigQuery routines helps organizations track and monitor
  access and modifications, providing a comprehensive audit trail essential for data
  integrity and compliance. It mitigates security risks by identifying unauthorized
  access and allows for timely incident response. Logging is crucial for compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 which require detailed activity records.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for BigQuery routines within
  the Data Analytics group. To ensure proper logging, configure the appropriate logging
  sinks in Google Cloud's Logging service to capture routine execution. Verify that
  logs are being generated and stored securely by checking the integration with Cloud
  Logging. Remediation involves enabling logging settings in the Cloud Console or
  using gcloud CLI commands to capture detailed audit logs for routine operations.
