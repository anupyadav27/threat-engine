title: Enforce Least Privilege in BigQuery Dataset Access
rationale: Adhering to the principle of least privilege in BigQuery ensures that users
  have only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, reducing the
  risk of data breaches and unauthorized data access. This is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate strict access controls to safeguard personal and
  financial information.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles assigned to users and service accounts
  on BigQuery datasets are limited to the minimum necessary permissions. Roles such
  as 'bigquery.dataViewer' should be used instead of broader roles like 'bigquery.admin'.
  Regularly audit and review IAM policies associated with datasets to ensure compliance
  with the least privilege principle. Implementing resource-level access controls
  can effectively minimize the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks.
