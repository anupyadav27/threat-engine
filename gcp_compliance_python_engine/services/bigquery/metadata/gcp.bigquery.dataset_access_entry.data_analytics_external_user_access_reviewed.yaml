title: Review External User Access to BigQuery Datasets
rationale: Regularly reviewing external user access to BigQuery datasets is crucial
  because unauthorized or outdated access can lead to data breaches, compromising
  sensitive information and violating compliance regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and SOC2. Ensuring that only necessary external users have access minimizes the
  attack surface and helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks whether access entries for external users on BigQuery
  datasets have been reviewed and updated regularly. It involves verifying access
  configurations through the IAM policy bindings for datasets, ensuring that permissions
  are granted based on the principle of least privilege. Remediation includes conducting
  a periodic audit of dataset access entries, removing unnecessary external user permissions,
  and documenting the review process for accountability.
