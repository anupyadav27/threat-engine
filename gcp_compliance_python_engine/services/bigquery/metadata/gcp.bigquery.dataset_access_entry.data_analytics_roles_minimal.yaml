title: Limit BigQuery Dataset Access to Essential Data Analytics Roles
rationale: Restricting dataset access to minimal required roles reduces the risk of
  unauthorized data exposure, which is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity. Over-permissioned roles can lead to accidental or malicious data
  leakage, impacting business reputation and violating data protection regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that BigQuery dataset access entries are assigned only
  to necessary data analytics roles, such as 'roles/bigquery.dataViewer' or 'roles/bigquery.metadataViewer',
  to minimize privilege levels. Verify by reviewing IAM policies attached to datasets
  and adjust roles to ensure least privilege. Remediate by removing excessive roles
  and assigning only essential roles needed for specific data analysis tasks.
