title: Enable Column-Level Access Controls on BigQuery Tables
rationale: Implementing column-level access controls in BigQuery is crucial to protecting
  sensitive data by ensuring that users only access data necessary for their roles.
  This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, which can lead to
  significant financial and reputational damage, and ensures compliance with regulations
  like GDPR that mandate data minimization and access restrictions.
description: This rule checks if column-level access controls are enabled on BigQuery
  tables, which restrict access to certain columns based on user roles. To verify,
  inspect the table's access policy configuration in the GCP Console or via the bq
  command-line tool, and ensure that appropriate IAM roles are defined for sensitive
  columns. To remediate, define and apply IAM policies that specify who can access
  sensitive columns, using the GCP Console or the bq tool.
