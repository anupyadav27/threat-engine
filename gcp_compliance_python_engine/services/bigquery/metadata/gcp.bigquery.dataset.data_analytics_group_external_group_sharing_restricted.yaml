title: Restrict External Sharing for BigQuery Data Analytics Groups
rationale: Restricting external sharing of datasets in BigQuery minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized data access, which could lead to data breaches or loss of sensitive
  information. This control helps organizations comply with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and CCPA by ensuring that data is only shared with trusted entities.
description: This rule checks that datasets in BigQuery are not shared with external
  groups outside of the organization. To verify compliance, inspect the dataset's
  IAM policies to ensure that no external identities have been granted access. Remediation
  involves reviewing and modifying IAM policies to remove any permissions granted
  to external groups, thus limiting data sharing to internal users or trusted partners
  only.
