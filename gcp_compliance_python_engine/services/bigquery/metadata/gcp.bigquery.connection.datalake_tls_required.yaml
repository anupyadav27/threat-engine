title: Ensure TLS is Enabled for BigQuery Datalake Connections
rationale: Requiring TLS for BigQuery Datalake connections helps protect sensitive
  data from interception and unauthorized access during transmission. Failing to enforce
  TLS can lead to data breaches, non-compliance with data protection regulations like
  GDPR and HIPAA, and potentially severe financial and reputational damage to the
  organization.
description: This rule checks if TLS is enforced for connections to BigQuery Datalake.
  TLS encryption ensures that data in transit is secure and protected against eavesdropping
  and man-in-the-middle attacks. To verify, review the connection settings in the
  Google Cloud Console or use gcloud commands to ensure `--require-tls` is set to
  true. If TLS is not enforced, update the connection settings to enable TLS by following
  the Google Cloud documentation for configuring secure connections.
