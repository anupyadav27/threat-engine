title: Ensure BigQuery Tables Use Automatic Security Updates
rationale: Enabling automatic upgrades for BigQuery tables ensures that the latest
  security patches and enhancements are applied without delay. This reduces the risk
  of data breaches and compliance violations by protecting against newly discovered
  vulnerabilities. It also aligns with regulatory requirements for maintaining up-to-date
  security measures, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust with
  stakeholders.
description: This rule checks whether automatic security updates are enabled for BigQuery
  tables. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select 'BigQuery', and
  review the settings under 'Automatic Updates' for each table. If not enabled, configure
  the table settings to allow automatic updates, ensuring that security patches are
  applied regularly. This ensures that security vulnerabilities are mitigated promptly,
  minimizing exposure to potential threats.
