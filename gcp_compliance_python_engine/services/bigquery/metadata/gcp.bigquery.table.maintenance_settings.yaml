title: Ensure BigQuery Table Maintenance Settings are Configured
rationale: Proper maintenance settings in BigQuery tables ensure that data access
  and changes are monitored and controlled, reducing the risk of unauthorized modifications
  or data loss. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance with
  regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict data handling
  and auditing practices.
description: This check verifies that BigQuery tables have appropriate maintenance
  settings configured, including setting up update and delete protections and ensuring
  that audit logging is enabled. To verify, check the table configurations for the
  presence of IAM policies that restrict access to data modification operations and
  ensure that logging is enabled via the GCP Console or gcloud CLI. Remediation involves
  setting up IAM roles with the principle of least privilege and configuring audit
  logs in the Cloud Logging service.
