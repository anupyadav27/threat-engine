title: Restrict BigQuery Dataset Roles for Data Analytics Group
rationale: Limiting roles to the Data Analytics Group ensures that users have only
  the necessary permissions, reducing the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access.
  This adherence to the principle of least privilege helps prevent potential data
  breaches and supports compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and
  CCPA.
description: This rule checks that BigQuery datasets do not grant excessive permissions
  to data analytics groups, specifically ensuring roles are limited to only what is
  necessary for analytics tasks. Verify that roles such as 'roles/bigquery.dataViewer'
  or 'roles/bigquery.dataEditor' are assigned instead of broader roles like 'roles/bigquery.admin'.
  Remediation involves reviewing IAM policies and adjusting the roles to align with
  the principle of least privilege, ensuring compliance with security best practices.
