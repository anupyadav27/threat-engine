title: Enable Audit Logging for BigQuery Tables
rationale: Audit logging is crucial in detecting unauthorized access and changes to
  BigQuery tables, which can lead to data breaches or non-compliance with regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA. It provides a comprehensive record of data access and modifications,
  enabling organizations to monitor and respond to security incidents effectively.
description: This rule checks if audit logging is enabled for all BigQuery tables
  within the project. Audit logs should capture 'Admin Read', 'Admin Write', and 'Data
  Read' events to ensure visibility into all access and modification actions. To verify,
  check the Logging section under IAM & Admin in the GCP Console and ensure that the
  appropriate log types are enabled. Remediate by configuring the necessary log types
  in the IAM policies for BigQuery resources.
