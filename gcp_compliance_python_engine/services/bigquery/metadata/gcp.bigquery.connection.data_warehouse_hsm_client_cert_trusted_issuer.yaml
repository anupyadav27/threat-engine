service: bigquery
resource: connection
requirement: Data Warehouse Hsm Client Cert Trusted Issuer
scope: bigquery.connection.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure BigQuery HSM Client Cert Has Trusted Issuer
rationale: Trusted issuers for HSM client certificates in BigQuery ensure that only
  authorized entities can establish secure connections, mitigating risks of data breaches
  and unauthorized access. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and
  integrity, especially in environments handling sensitive information. Compliance
  with industry standards and regulatory requirements often mandates the use of trusted
  certificate authorities.
description: This rule checks that BigQuery connections using HSM client certificates
  originate from trusted certificate issuers. To validate, ensure that the issuer's
  certificate is listed in the trusted certificate authorities of your GCP environment.
  Remediation involves updating the list of trusted issuers or contacting your certificate
  authority to address any discrepancies. Proper configuration helps prevent unauthorized
  data access and supports encryption at rest policies.
