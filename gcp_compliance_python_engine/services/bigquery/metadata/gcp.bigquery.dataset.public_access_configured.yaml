title: Prevent Public Access to BigQuery Datasets
rationale: Public access to BigQuery datasets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Organizations risk reputational
  damage and financial penalties if confidential information is leaked. Securing datasets
  aligns with regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate
  strict access controls to protect personal and financial data.
description: This rule checks if any BigQuery datasets are configured with public
  access, which allows any user with an internet connection to read or modify data.
  To verify, inspect the dataset's permissions in the Google Cloud Console or via
  gcloud CLI for entries granting roles to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'.
  To remediate, remove such entries and set permissions to only include authorized
  users or groups with specific roles like 'READER' or 'WRITER'.
