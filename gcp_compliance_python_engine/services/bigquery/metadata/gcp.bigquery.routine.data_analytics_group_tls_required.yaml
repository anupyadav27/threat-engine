rule_id: gcp.bigquery.routine.data_analytics_group_tls_required
service: bigquery
resource: routine
requirement: Data Analytics Group TLS Required
scope: bigquery.routine.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure TLS is Enforced for BigQuery Routine Connections
rationale: Enforcing TLS for BigQuery routines is critical to protect data in transit
  from unauthorized access and potential interception. Failure to secure these connections
  can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive analytics and violating compliance
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if TLS is required for all connections to BigQuery routines,
  ensuring that data transmitted between clients and BigQuery services is encrypted.
  To verify, review the IAM policies and network settings associated with BigQuery
  routines for TLS enforcement. Remediation involves configuring network security
  settings to mandate TLS for all external and internal communications, ensuring alignment
  with organizational security policies.
