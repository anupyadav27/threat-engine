title: Enable BigQuery Table Automated Snapshots
rationale: Automated snapshots of BigQuery tables enhance data resilience by allowing
  recovery from data loss events, such as accidental deletions or corruptions. This
  practice ensures business continuity, minimizes downtime, and supports compliance
  with data protection regulations by providing a recovery point objective (RPO).
description: This rule checks if automated snapshots are enabled for BigQuery tables,
  ensuring regular backups. Automated snapshots should be configured through the BigQuery
  service to create point-in-time copies of data, which can be retained for a defined
  period. To enable, use the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool to set
  up snapshot schedules. Remediation involves reviewing table configurations and enabling
  automated snapshots where missing.
