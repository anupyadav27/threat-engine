title: Ensure Cross-Region BigQuery Table Copies Use Encryption
rationale: Encrypting cross-region BigQuery table copies protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access during transit and storage. Without encryption, data is vulnerable
  to interception and breaches, posing risks to data integrity and compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Encryption at rest helps mitigate potential data
  exposure in the event of unauthorized access to the storage infrastructure.
description: This rule checks that BigQuery tables copied across regions are encrypted.
  Ensure that Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) are applied when creating cross-region
  copies to secure data against unauthorized access. Verify table settings in the
  BigQuery console or via CLI to ensure encryption is enabled and configured with
  CMEK. If encryption is not enabled, update the table settings to apply CMEK or transfer
  data with encryption options enabled.
