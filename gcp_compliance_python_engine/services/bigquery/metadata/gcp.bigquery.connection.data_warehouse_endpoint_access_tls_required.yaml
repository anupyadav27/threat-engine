title: Ensure TLS for BigQuery Data Warehouse Endpoint Access
rationale: Enforcing TLS for BigQuery connections ensures data integrity and confidentiality
  during transit. Without TLS, data transferred between clients and the BigQuery service
  can be intercepted or tampered with, posing a risk of data breaches. Ensuring TLS
  compliance helps meet regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  secure data transmission practices.
description: This rule checks if TLS is enforced for data warehouse endpoints in BigQuery
  connections. It ensures that any connection to the BigQuery service uses TLS to
  encrypt data in transit. To verify, inspect the configuration settings under BigQuery
  connections and ensure the 'requireTLS' property is set to true. Remediation involves
  updating the settings to enforce TLS for all connections, which can typically be
  configured via the GCP Console or using the bq command-line tool.
