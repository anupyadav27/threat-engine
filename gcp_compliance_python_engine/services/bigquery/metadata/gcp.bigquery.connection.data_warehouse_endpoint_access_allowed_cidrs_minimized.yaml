title: Limit Allowed CIDRs for BigQuery Connection Endpoints
rationale: Restricting CIDR ranges for BigQuery connection endpoints minimizes exposure
  to unauthorized access, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  data manipulation. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance
  with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict control over
  data access.
description: This rule checks whether the CIDR ranges allowed for BigQuery connection
  endpoints are minimized to only those necessary for legitimate access. It ensures
  that only specific, trusted IP ranges can access the BigQuery data warehouse, lowering
  the risk of malicious actors exploiting overly permissive access controls. Verification
  involves reviewing the CIDR configurations in the BigQuery connection settings and
  adjusting them to the least permissive ranges necessary for operational requirements.
