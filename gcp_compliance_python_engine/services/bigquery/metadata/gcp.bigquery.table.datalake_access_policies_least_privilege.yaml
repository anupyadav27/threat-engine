service: bigquery
resource: table
requirement: Datalake Access Policies Least Privilege
scope: bigquery.table.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege Access to BigQuery Datalake Tables
rationale: Implementing least privilege access controls for BigQuery tables mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized data access, reducing the attack surface and potential
  data breaches. It ensures compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR
  and CCPA by restricting access to sensitive data. Inadequate access management could
  lead to data leaks, insider threats, and non-compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether access to BigQuery tables is granted based on
  the principle of least privilege. It verifies that IAM roles assigned to users and
  service accounts have only the necessary permissions for their tasks. To remediate,
  audit table-level IAM policies and remove any users or roles with excessive permissions.
  Use predefined roles where appropriate and regularly review access logs to ensure
  continued compliance.
