title: Restrict Public Access to BigQuery Tables
rationale: Allowing public access to BigQuery tables can lead to unauthorized data
  exposure, resulting in potential data breaches and compliance violations. This is
  critical for organizations handling sensitive or regulated data, as it can impact
  customer trust and lead to significant financial penalties under frameworks like
  GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if any BigQuery tables are accessible by the 'allUsers'
  or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' groups, which indicates public access. To verify, inspect
  the IAM policy bindings of each table for these entries. Remediation involves removing
  these public entries and ensuring that only specific, authenticated users or groups
  have access, achieved via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool.
