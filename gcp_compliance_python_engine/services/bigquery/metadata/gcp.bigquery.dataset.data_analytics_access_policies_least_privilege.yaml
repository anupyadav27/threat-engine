title: Ensure BigQuery Datasets Use Least Privilege Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for BigQuery datasets minimizes the
  risk of data breaches by ensuring users and services have only the permissions they
  need to perform their tasks. This approach reduces the potential attack surface
  and limits damage in case of compromised credentials, thus supporting compliance
  with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks BigQuery dataset access policies to ensure they adhere
  to the principle of least privilege. It verifies that permissions are granted based
  on necessity rather than convenience, avoiding overly broad roles like 'Editor'
  or 'Owner' for routine data analytics tasks. To remediate, audit all IAM policies
  associated with BigQuery datasets and restrict roles to the minimum required for
  functionality, using predefined roles or custom roles where necessary.
