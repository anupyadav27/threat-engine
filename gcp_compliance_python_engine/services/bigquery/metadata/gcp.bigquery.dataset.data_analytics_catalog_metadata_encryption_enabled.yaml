title: Ensure BigQuery Dataset Metadata Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption for BigQuery dataset metadata protects sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and exposure. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality,
  preventing data breaches, and complying with regulatory standards such as HIPAA
  and PCI-DSS which mandate encryption of sensitive information. By encrypting metadata,
  organizations reduce the risk of data theft and enhance trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule checks if BigQuery datasets have encryption enabled for their
  metadata using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). By default, Google Cloud
  encrypts data at rest using Google-managed keys. For enhanced security, configure
  datasets to use CMEK, which offers greater control over encryption keys. Verification
  can be done via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI by inspecting the encryption
  configuration of each dataset. To remediate, update the dataset's encryption settings
  to use a Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) key.
