title: Disable Public Sharing for BigQuery Datasets
rationale: Allowing public sharing of BigQuery datasets can expose sensitive data
  to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Public
  access increases the risk of data exfiltration and non-compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Ensuring datasets are not publicly shared helps
  mitigate these threats and protect organizational assets.
description: This rule checks for public access permissions on BigQuery datasets and
  ensures that sharing with 'allUsers' and 'allAuthenticatedUsers' is disabled. To
  verify, review the Access Control settings of BigQuery datasets and remove any entries
  that allow public access. Remediation involves using the GCP Console or CLI to modify
  IAM policies, ensuring datasets are shared only with specific, authorized users
  or groups.
