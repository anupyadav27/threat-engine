title: Ensure BigQuery Audit Logging is Enabled for Datasets
rationale: Enabling audit logging for BigQuery datasets is crucial for monitoring
  access and changes to data, which helps in detecting unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Audit logs play a key role in fulfilling compliance requirements
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate tracking data access and modifications to protect
  sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for BigQuery datasets,
  ensuring all access and changes are logged for review. To check, navigate to the
  Google Cloud Console, select the relevant dataset, and ensure that audit logging
  is configured. Remediation involves enabling audit logging by setting up the appropriate
  logging configurations in the GCP Console under the 'Logging' section for BigQuery
  datasets.
