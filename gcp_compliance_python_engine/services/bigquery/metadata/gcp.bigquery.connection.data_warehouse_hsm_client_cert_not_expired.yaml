service: bigquery
resource: connection
requirement: Data Warehouse Hsm Client Cert Not Expired
scope: bigquery.connection.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure BigQuery HSM Client Certificates Are Valid
rationale: Expired HSM client certificates in BigQuery connections can lead to unauthorized
  data access, data breaches, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
  Ensuring that these certificates are valid helps maintain secure data transfer and
  aligns with regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, reducing the risk
  of data exposure and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether the HSM client certificates used in BigQuery
  connections have expired. Expired certificates can compromise encrypted data integrity
  and confidentiality. Administrators should regularly monitor certificate expiration
  dates and renew certificates before expiration to maintain secure connections. Verification
  can be done through the GCP Console or CLI by reviewing the certificate's validity
  period associated with the BigQuery connection.
