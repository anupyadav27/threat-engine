title: Ensure BigQuery TLS Version 1.2+ for Data Warehouse Cluster
rationale: Enforcing a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for BigQuery datasets helps protect
  sensitive data from interception and tampering during transit. This is crucial for
  maintaining data privacy and integrity, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Organizations can
  avoid potential financial penalties and reputational damage by adhering to these
  security standards.
description: This rule checks that all BigQuery datasets in a data warehouse cluster
  enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2. To verify, ensure that your BigQuery configurations
  specify TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit. If a dataset does not meet this requirement,
  update the dataset configuration via the Google Cloud Console or use the bq command-line
  tool to enforce the required TLS version. Regular audits should be conducted to
  ensure compliance.
