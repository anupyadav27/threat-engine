rule_id: gcp.bigquery.table.datalake_partition_catalog_encrypted
service: bigquery
resource: table
requirement: Datalake Partition Catalog Encrypted
scope: bigquery.table.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure BigQuery Table Partitions Have Encryption at Rest
rationale: Encrypting data in BigQuery tables, particularly in datalake partitions,
  safeguards against unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead to significant
  financial and reputational damage. It is critical for meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA that mandate data protection measures. Without encryption,
  sensitive information is vulnerable to exposure from both internal and external
  threats.
description: This rule verifies that all BigQuery table partitions in the datalake
  catalog are encrypted using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys.
  To check compliance, review the encryption configuration of BigQuery tables via
  the GCP Console or CLI. If tables are not encrypted, apply Google-managed encryption
  keys by default, or configure Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for enhanced
  control. Ensure that all partitions of each table are consistently encrypted at
  rest.
