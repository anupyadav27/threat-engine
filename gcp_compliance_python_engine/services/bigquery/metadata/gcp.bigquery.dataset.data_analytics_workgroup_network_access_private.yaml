title: Ensure BigQuery Dataset Access via Private Networks
rationale: Restricting BigQuery dataset access to private networks reduces exposure
  to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice aligns with security
  best practices by limiting the attack surface and ensures compliance with regulations
  like HIPAA and PCI-DSS that emphasize data security and privacy.
description: This rule verifies that BigQuery datasets are only accessible through
  private IPs by configuring VPC Service Controls and enabling Private Google Access.
  To confirm, ensure that datasets are part of a service perimeter and that network
  access is restricted to private subnets. Remediation involves setting up appropriate
  network policies and VPC configurations to enforce private access.
