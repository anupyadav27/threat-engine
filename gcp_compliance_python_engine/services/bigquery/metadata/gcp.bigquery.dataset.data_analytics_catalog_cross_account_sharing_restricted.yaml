service: bigquery
resource: dataset
requirement: Data Analytics Catalog Cross Account Sharing Restricted
scope: bigquery.dataset.logging
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Restrict BigQuery Dataset Cross-Account Sharing
rationale: Limiting cross-account sharing of BigQuery datasets mitigates security
  risks associated with unauthorized access and data leakage. This is crucial for
  maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks for any instances of BigQuery datasets being shared
  with external accounts or domains outside of your organization. It is important
  to verify that datasets are only shared with trusted entities and to audit sharing
  configurations regularly. Remediation involves reviewing dataset IAM policies, removing
  unauthorized accounts, and implementing strict sharing controls to prevent inadvertent
  data exposure.
