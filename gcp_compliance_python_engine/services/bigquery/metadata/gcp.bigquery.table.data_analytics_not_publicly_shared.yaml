title: Prevent Public Sharing of BigQuery Tables
rationale: Publicly sharing BigQuery tables can lead to unauthorized data access,
  exposing sensitive information to external threats and increasing the risk of data
  breaches. This practice can result in compliance violations with regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, potentially resulting in financial penalties and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks for BigQuery tables that have been configured with public
  access, which allows anyone on the Internet to view or download the data. To verify,
  review the table's IAM policy bindings and ensure that 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
  are not granted roles such as 'roles/bigquery.dataViewer'. Remediation involves
  removing any public bindings and applying the principle of least privilege by granting
  access only to specific users or groups who require it.
