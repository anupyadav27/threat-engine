title: Ensure BigQuery Dataset Classification is Configured
rationale: Configuring classification for BigQuery datasets is crucial for data protection
  and privacy, as it helps categorize and apply appropriate security controls to sensitive
  data. Failure to configure classification can result in inadequate data protection,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance with
  data privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if classification is configured for BigQuery datasets,
  ensuring that data is properly categorized and protected. Verify that datasets have
  appropriate classification tags and labels configured in the BigQuery console or
  via API. Remediation involves reviewing your datasets, identifying the sensitivity
  of the data they contain, and applying suitable classification labels to enhance
  security measures and meet compliance requirements.
