severity: medium
title: Ensure Patch Deployments Are Managed and Compliant
rationale: Regular patch management is critical to protect systems against vulnerabilities
  that can be exploited by attackers, potentially leading to data breaches or system
  compromise. Managed compliant patching helps maintain system integrity, reduces
  the risk of exposure to known threats, and supports regulatory compliance with standards
  like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether patch deployments on Google Cloud Platform are
  configured for compliant patch management using OS Configuration. Ensure that patch
  deployment schedules are defined and that compliance reports are regularly reviewed
  to verify successful patching. Remediation involves configuring patch deployments
  via the GCP Console or API to automate updates and setting alerts for failed patches.
