title: Ensure Patch Deployment Compliance in OS Config
rationale: Regular patch deployment is crucial to protect systems from vulnerabilities
  that could be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
  Ensuring compliant patching helps maintain system integrity, reduces the risk of
  security incidents, and aligns with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and NIST,
  which require timely application of security patches.
description: This rule checks if patch deployments in OS Config are configured to
  apply updates within a defined schedule, ensuring that all instances are patched
  in compliance with security policies. Verify that patch deployments are set up with
  correct schedules and target the intended instances. To remediate, configure patch
  deployments with appropriate settings using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI
  to ensure that all compute instances receive necessary security updates promptly.
