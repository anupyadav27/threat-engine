severity: low
title: Ensure Patch Deployment Exemptions Have Expiry and Owner
rationale: Without expiry dates and ownership assignment for vulnerability baseline
  exemptions, organizations risk leaving systems unpatched indefinitely, increasing
  exposure to security threats. This oversight can lead to non-compliance with industry
  regulations and standards, potentially resulting in financial penalties and reputational
  damage. Assigning ownership ensures accountability and timely review of exemptions.
description: This rule checks that all vulnerability baseline exemptions in patch
  deployments have a specified expiry date and an assigned owner. These configurations
  help ensure that exemptions are temporary and reviewed periodically. To verify,
  examine the patch deployment configurations in the GCP Console or via gcloud CLI
  to ensure 'expiryDate' and 'owner' fields are populated. Remediate by updating configurations
  to include these fields where missing.
