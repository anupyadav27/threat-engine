title: Ensure Vulnerability Patch Baseline for OS Families in GCP
rationale: Defining a vulnerability patch baseline for operating system families is
  crucial for maintaining system integrity and reducing the risk of exploitation through
  known vulnerabilities. Organizations face threats like data breaches and service
  disruptions when systems are left unpatched. Ensuring a baseline helps comply with
  standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate timely patch management.
description: This rule checks that a vulnerability patch baseline is defined for each
  operating system family in the Google Cloud Platform using the OS Config service.
  It ensures that patch deployments are configured to apply security patches to all
  instances, reducing exposure to vulnerabilities. Verification involves reviewing
  the OS Config patch deployment settings to confirm that vulnerability patching is
  enabled for all relevant OS families. Remediation requires updating the patch deployment
  to include a defined baseline for security updates.
