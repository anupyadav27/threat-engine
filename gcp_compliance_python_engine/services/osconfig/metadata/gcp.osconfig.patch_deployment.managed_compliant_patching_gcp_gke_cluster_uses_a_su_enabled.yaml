scope: osconfig.patch_deployment.patch_management
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: medium
title: Ensure SU Enabled for GKE Cluster Patch Deployments
rationale: Enabling SU for GKE cluster patch deployments ensures that patches are
  applied under elevated privileges, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential exploitation. This enhances the security posture by ensuring that critical
  security updates are applied promptly and correctly, mitigating vulnerabilities
  that could be exploited by threat actors. Compliance with regulatory standards often
  requires such stringent patch management practices to protect sensitive data and
  maintain system integrity.
description: This rule checks if the GKE clusters utilize an SU-enabled patch deployment
  configuration within the Google Cloud OS Config service. It ensures that patches
  are deployed with superuser privileges, which is critical for applying certain types
  of updates that require elevated permissions. To verify compliance, audit your patch
  deployment configurations and ensure that SU is enabled. Remediation involves updating
  patch deployment settings to enable SU, which can be done via the Google Cloud Console
  or gcloud command-line tool.
