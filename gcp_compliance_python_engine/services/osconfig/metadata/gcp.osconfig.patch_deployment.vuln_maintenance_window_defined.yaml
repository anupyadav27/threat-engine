title: Define Vulnerability Maintenance Window for Patch Deployment
rationale: Defining a maintenance window for patch deployment ensures timely application
  of security patches, reducing exposure to vulnerabilities. This minimizes the risk
  of exploitation by threat actors and maintains system integrity. Proper scheduling
  also aligns with business operation times, minimizing disruption and meeting compliance
  with security standards.
description: This rule checks whether a maintenance window is defined for each patch
  deployment in the GCP OS Config service. A well-defined maintenance window ensures
  that security patches are applied consistently and at times that minimize business
  impact. To verify, inspect the patch deployment configuration for a specified maintenance
  window. Remediate by adding a maintenance window to the patch deployment settings
  through the GCP Console or via API.
