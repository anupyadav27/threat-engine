title: Ensure OS Config Patch Compliance is Configured
rationale: Unpatched systems can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access
  or disrupt services. Configuring patch compliance ensures vulnerabilities are addressed
  promptly, reducing the risk of breaches and downtime. This is crucial for meeting
  compliance requirements such as NIST SP 800-53 and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether patch compliance is configured in Google Cloud's
  OS Config service for guest policies. It evaluates if patch configurations are specified
  to ensure that systems are regularly updated. To verify, review your guest policy
  settings in the Google Cloud Console under 'OS Config' and ensure that patch compliance
  settings are active. Remediation involves defining a patch compliance policy that
  specifies update schedules and critical patch installations.
