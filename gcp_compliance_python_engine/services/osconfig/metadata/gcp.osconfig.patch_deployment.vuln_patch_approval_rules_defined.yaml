title: Define Vulnerability Patch Approval Rules for Patch Deployments
rationale: Defining vulnerability patch approval rules in GCP's OS Config ensures
  that all patches, especially critical security updates, are reviewed and approved
  before deployment. This reduces the risk of deploying untested patches that might
  cause system instability or downtime. It also helps in meeting regulatory requirements
  and maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment.
description: "This rule checks whether vulnerability patch approval rules are defined\
  \ for patch deployments in Google Cloud's OS Config service. Ensuring these rules\
  \ are set up means that any patches, particularly those addressing known vulnerabilities,\
  \ are subjected to an approval process before being applied to instances. To verify\
  \ compliance, review the patch deployment configurations in your GCP Console and\
  \ ensure that approval rules are specified. Remediation involves defining approval\
  \ rules that align with your organization\u2019s security policies and updating\
  \ the patch deployment settings accordingly."
