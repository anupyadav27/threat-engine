title: Ensure Patch Maintenance Windows Are Configured for Vulnerability Patching
rationale: Properly configuring patch maintenance windows for vulnerability management
  ensures that critical and high-severity patches are applied in a timely manner,
  reducing the risk of exploitation. This practice helps maintain system integrity
  and availability, minimizes downtime during patching, and supports compliance with
  security standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
description: This rule checks if patch deployments are configured with maintenance
  windows in Google Cloud's OS Config service. A maintenance window specifies when
  a patch deployment can be executed, which is crucial for planning and minimizing
  disruption. To verify, ensure that each patch deployment has a defined schedule
  for maintenance windows. Remediation involves configuring the patch deployment with
  a suitable maintenance window through the OS Config API or Cloud Console, ensuring
  alignment with operational needs.
