title: Ensure Managed Compliant Patching is Configured for OS Config
rationale: Properly configured compliant patching ensures that all instances are up-to-date
  with security patches, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
  This is critical for maintaining the integrity of systems, preventing unauthorized
  access, and complying with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Inadequate
  patch management can lead to breaches and data loss, impacting business continuity
  and reputation.
description: This rule checks that Google Cloud OS Config is configured to manage
  compliant patching for all patch deployments. Specifically, it verifies that patch
  deployments have a defined configuration for automated and regular security patches.
  To verify, ensure that patch deployments include a patch configuration that aligns
  with your organization's policies. Remediation involves setting up a patch deployment
  schedule in OS Config and specifying the required patch compliance settings to automate
  security updates.
