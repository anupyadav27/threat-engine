title: Ensure Vulnerability Baseline Controls in Patch Deployments
rationale: Insufficient patch management can leave systems vulnerable to exploits,
  leading to potential data breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance with
  regulatory frameworks such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Establishing a vulnerability baseline
  ensures that all instances meet security standards, reducing the risk of attack
  vectors through unpatched software.
description: This rule checks that all patch deployments in Google Cloud OS Config
  include required vulnerability baseline controls. It verifies that patch deployments
  are configured to address critical and high-severity vulnerabilities. To comply,
  ensure that patch deployment configurations specify required baseline criteria and
  that patches are applied within the defined maintenance window. Remediation involves
  updating patch deployment configurations to meet security baseline requirements
  and scheduling regular patch assessments.
