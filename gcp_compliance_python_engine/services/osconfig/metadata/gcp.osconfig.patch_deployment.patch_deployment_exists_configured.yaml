title: Ensure Patch Deployment Configured for OS Patching
rationale: Unpatched systems are vulnerable to security exploits, which can lead to
  unauthorized access and data breaches. Configuring patch deployments ensures that
  systems are regularly updated, reducing exposure to known vulnerabilities and maintaining
  compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001. Automated patch management
  minimizes downtime and operational disruptions.
description: This rule checks if patch deployment configurations are set up in GCP
  OS Config to manage system updates automatically. Verify that patch deployments
  exist and are scheduled to run at appropriate intervals. Remediation involves creating
  patch deployment schedules that include approved patches, specifying target VM instances,
  and setting maintenance windows to minimize impact on operations. Ensure that all
  critical and security patches are applied in a timely manner.
