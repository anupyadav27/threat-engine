title: Enforce Lineage Version Immutability in Data Catalog
rationale: Enforcing version immutability for data lineage in GCP's Data Catalog is
  crucial as it ensures the integrity and authenticity of data history. This mitigates
  risks associated with unauthorized changes that could lead to data breaches or compliance
  violations, such as those outlined in GDPR and CCPA. Immutable versions also help
  in maintaining accurate audit trails and support forensic investigations, thereby
  enhancing trust in data governance practices.
description: This rule checks whether lineage version immutability is enforced for
  entries in the GCP Data Catalog. Configuring immutable versions prevents any alterations
  to recorded data lineage, preserving a reliable history of data transformations
  and movements. Verification involves reviewing Data Catalog settings to ensure that
  versioning policies are properly configured and enforced. To remediate, enable versioning
  policies that specify immutability for lineage records, and audit configurations
  regularly to ensure ongoing compliance.
