resource: entry
requirement: Datalake Catalog Metadata Encryption Enabled
scope: datacatalog.entry.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Metadata Encryption for Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Enabling encryption for Data Catalog metadata protects sensitive data from
  unauthorized access and potential breaches. This is critical in maintaining data
  confidentiality and integrity, especially in industries with strict regulatory requirements
  such as finance and healthcare. Encryption at rest safeguards against threats like
  data theft or unauthorized disclosure, aligning with compliance mandates like GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for metadata stored in
  Google Cloud Data Catalog entries, ensuring data is encrypted at rest. To verify,
  check the encryption configuration of your Data Catalog entries to confirm they
  use Google-managed or customer-managed keys. Remediation involves configuring the
  Data Catalog to use encryption keys, preferably customer-managed keys, to enhance
  control over the encryption processes.
