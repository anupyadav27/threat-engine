title: Ensure Trusted Source for Datalake Classifier Tags
rationale: Ensuring that only trusted sources can apply tags in Data Catalog helps
  prevent unauthorized data classification, which can lead to data leakage, misclassification,
  and potential breaches. Mismanagement of data classification tags can result in
  non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, exposing the organization to
  legal and financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that only trusted entities are allowed to create or
  modify tag templates in Google Cloud Data Catalog, specifically for Datalake classifiers.
  Check that IAM policies for tag templates strictly limit permissions to verified
  sources. Remediation involves auditing current IAM roles and permissions, then revoking
  access from untrusted entities and ensuring that only secured service accounts or
  authenticated users have the necessary roles to apply tags.
