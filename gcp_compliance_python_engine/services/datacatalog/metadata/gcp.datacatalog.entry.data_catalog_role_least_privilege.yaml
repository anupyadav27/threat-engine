title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Catalog Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege in Data Catalog roles minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. By restricting permissions
  to only what is necessary, organizations can reduce their attack surface and comply
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which emphasize data protection
  and privacy.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to Data Catalog entries adhere to
  the principle of least privilege by ensuring that users and service accounts have
  only the permissions necessary for their tasks. To verify compliance, review IAM
  policies for Data Catalog entries and adjust role assignments to align with least
  privilege principles. Remediation involves auditing current role configurations,
  identifying excessive permissions, and reassigning roles with reduced privileges
  while ensuring necessary operations are not hindered.
