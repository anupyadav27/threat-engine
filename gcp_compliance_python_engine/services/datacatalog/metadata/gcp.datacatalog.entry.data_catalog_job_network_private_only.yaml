title: Enforce Private Network for Data Catalog Jobs
rationale: Restricting Data Catalog jobs to private networks minimizes exposure to
  unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches. This control is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially when dealing with
  sensitive information. It aligns with regulatory requirements for protecting data
  in transit and supports compliance with frameworks like ISO 27001 and NIST.
description: This check ensures that Data Catalog jobs are configured to run exclusively
  within private networks, preventing exposure to public internet threats. Verify
  that the service account executing Data Catalog jobs has network restrictions applied
  to ensure the jobs communicate only over private IPs. Remediation involves setting
  network tags and firewall rules to permit job execution solely on private networks,
  ensuring secure data handling.
