title: Ensure Datalake Crawler Role Uses Least Privilege
rationale: Limiting permissions to the minimum necessary reduces the attack surface
  and potential for data breaches. Over-privileged roles can lead to unauthorized
  data access, which may result in regulatory non-compliance and financial penalties.
  Implementing least privilege is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining
  trust with users and stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that the roles assigned to Datalake crawlers in Google
  Cloud's Data Catalog service are configured with the principle of least privilege.
  Specifically, it checks whether the crawler role has only the necessary permissions
  to perform its function without excess capabilities. To remediate, review and adjust
  the IAM policy to ensure the crawler role only has essential permissions. Use the
  'iam.roles.get' and 'iam.roles.update' commands for this purpose, and regularly
  audit these roles to maintain compliance.
