title: Enable Audit Logging for Policy Tag Admin Changes
rationale: Enabling audit logging for policy tag admin changes in Google Cloud Data
  Catalog is crucial for maintaining a secure data governance framework. Without logging,
  unauthorized changes to policy tags could go undetected, leading to potential data
  exposure, loss of data integrity, and non-compliance with industry regulations such
  as GDPR or HIPAA. Audit logs help in tracking changes, facilitating forensic investigations,
  and ensuring accountability.
description: This rule checks that audit logging is enabled for all administrative
  changes to policy tags within Google Cloud Data Catalog. To verify, ensure that
  the Data Access audit logs for Data Catalog are configured to log admin write actions
  on policy tags. Remediation involves enabling audit logging in the Google Cloud
  Console under the IAM & Admin section, specifically within the audit logs settings
  for each project where Data Catalog is used.
