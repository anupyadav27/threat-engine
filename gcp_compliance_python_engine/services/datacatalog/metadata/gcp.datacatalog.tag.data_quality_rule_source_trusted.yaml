title: Ensure Trusted Sources for Data Quality Rules in Data Catalog
rationale: Ensuring that data quality rules in Data Catalog are sourced from trusted
  entities is crucial to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
  Untrusted sources can introduce erroneous data quality rules, leading to data misinterpretation
  and potential compliance breaches with standards like GDPR or CCPA. By validating
  the source of these rules, organizations can mitigate risks associated with data
  breaches and maintain trust with their stakeholders.
description: This rule checks that all data quality rules in Google Cloud's Data Catalog
  are sourced from verified, trusted sources. It involves verifying the source identity
  and ensuring their permissions align with the least privilege principle. To remediate,
  review and update IAM policies to restrict rule creation to trusted service accounts
  and regularly audit rule sources. Use Cloud Audit Logs to track changes and identify
  unauthorized modifications.
