subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Partition Catalog is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in Data Catalog is crucial for protecting sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and data breaches. Unencrypted data can be
  vulnerable to theft or exposure, posing compliance risks with standards like GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Encryption at rest helps mitigate these risks by ensuring that
  data remains secure even if the storage media is compromised.
description: This rule checks whether Data Catalog entries, specifically partition
  catalogs, are encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that encryption settings are configured in the Data Catalog
  API or via the Google Cloud Console. Remediation involves enabling encryption on
  existing entries and ensuring new entries are configured with encryption by default.
