title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Data Catalog Entry Groups
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Data Catalog entry groups is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data within your datalake registry.
  Unauthorized cross-account sharing can lead to data breaches, non-compliance with
  data protection regulations (such as GDPR or CCPA), and potential financial and
  reputational damage to your organization.
description: This rule checks for configurations in Google Cloud's Data Catalog to
  ensure that entry groups are not shared across different accounts without explicit
  authorization. Verify that IAM policies attached to Data Catalog entry groups do
  not include principals from external accounts. Remediation involves auditing IAM
  policies and removing any unauthorized external account permissions, ensuring only
  intended and trusted accounts have access.
