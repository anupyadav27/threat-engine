title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Tag Template Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for Data Catalog tag templates is crucial
  to minimize the risk of unauthorized data modification or exposure. Improper access
  configurations can lead to accidental data leaks or insider threats, impacting compliance
  with regulations like GDPR and CCPA and potentially causing significant business
  reputational and financial damage.
description: This rule checks if IAM roles assigned to Data Catalog tag templates
  adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure that only necessary permissions
  are granted to users and service accounts, limiting access to those required for
  specific tasks. To verify compliance, review IAM policies associated with each tag
  template and adjust roles to restrict permissions. Remediation involves using the
  Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to update IAM policies, ensuring only essential roles
  like 'roles/datacatalog.viewer' or 'roles/datacatalog.editor' are assigned as per
  operational needs.
