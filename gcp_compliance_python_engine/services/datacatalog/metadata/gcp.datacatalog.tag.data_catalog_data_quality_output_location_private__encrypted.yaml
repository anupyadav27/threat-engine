rule_id: gcp.datacatalog.tag.data_catalog_data_quality_output_location_private__encrypted
service: datacatalog
resource: tag
requirement: Data Catalog Data Quality Output Location Private Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.tag.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Data Quality Output is Private and Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting Data Catalog output locations ensures sensitive data is protected
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches, which could lead to financial loss,
  reputational damage, and non-compliance with data protection regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that Data Catalog data quality output locations are
  both private and encrypted using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys.
  Verify by ensuring the output location is in a Google Cloud Storage bucket that
  is not publicly accessible and has encryption enabled. To remediate, configure the
  bucket to disable public access and enable encryption settings.
