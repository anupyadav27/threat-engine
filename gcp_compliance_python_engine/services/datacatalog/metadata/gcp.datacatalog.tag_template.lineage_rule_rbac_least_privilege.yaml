title: Ensure Least Privilege on Data Catalog Tag Template Lineage
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to Data Catalog tag templates
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access or modification, protecting sensitive
  metadata associated with Google Cloud resources. This is critical for maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality, especially in compliance with regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls.
description: This rule checks whether IAM roles assigned to Data Catalog tag templates
  adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring only necessary permissions
  are granted. Verify that users and service accounts have the minimum required roles,
  such as 'roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateUser' instead of broader roles like 'roles/datacatalog.admin'.
  Remediation involves auditing current IAM policies, removing excessive permissions,
  and implementing least privilege access through role adjustments or custom roles
  as needed.
