title: Enable Lineage Job Logs and Metrics in Data Catalog
rationale: Enabling lineage job logs and metrics provides visibility into data processing
  activities within Google Cloud's Data Catalog. This is crucial for identifying unauthorized
  data access or anomalies, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining audit trails
  for compliance with standards like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. Failure to log these activities
  could result in undetected data breaches or compliance violations.
description: This rule checks if lineage job logs and metrics are enabled in the Data
  Catalog entries. To verify, ensure that logging and metrics collection are configured
  in the Google Cloud Console under Data Catalog settings. Remediation involves enabling
  the necessary logging options to capture detailed information about data lineage
  processes, which can be done via the GCP Console or by using Terraform with the
  appropriate logging configuration for Data Catalog.
