title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in Data Catalog Entry Groups
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing in Data Catalog minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. It ensures that sensitive
  metadata is only accessible to trusted accounts, aligning with data governance policies
  and compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks for configurations in Google Cloud Data Catalog to ensure
  entry groups are not shared across accounts unless explicitly required. To verify,
  inspect IAM policies on entry groups to confirm that cross-account principals are
  not granted access. Remediation involves removing unnecessary cross-account permissions
  and configuring IAM roles to limit access to necessary internal accounts only.
