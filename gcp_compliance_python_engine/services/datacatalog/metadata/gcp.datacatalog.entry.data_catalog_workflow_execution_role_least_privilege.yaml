requirement: Data Catalog Workflow Execution Role Least Privilege

subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Workflow Roles
rationale: Configuring least privilege for workflow execution roles in Data Catalog
  reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Overly permissive
  roles can lead to accidental or malicious data exposure, impacting compliance with
  regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and causing financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if Data Catalog workflow execution roles are configured
  with excessive privileges. It ensures roles only have permissions necessary for
  their intended tasks, adhering to the principle of least privilege. To verify, review
  IAM policies associated with Data Catalog entries and adjust them to minimize permissions.
  Remediation involves auditing current roles, identifying excessive permissions,
  and refining roles to align with operational requirements while maintaining security.
