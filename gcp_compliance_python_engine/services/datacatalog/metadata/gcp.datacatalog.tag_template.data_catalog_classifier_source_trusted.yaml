title: Ensure Data Catalog Classifier Sources Are Trusted
rationale: Trusting only verified data sources in Data Catalog prevents unauthorized
  or malicious data from being classified and used by your organization, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring data integrity. This is vital for meeting
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate secure handling of
  sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether the sources of data classified within Google
  Cloud Data Catalog are from trusted origins. Ensure that tag templates are configured
  to only include data from authenticated and verified sources. Verification can be
  done by setting up appropriate IAM permissions and using Google Cloud's identity
  and access management to restrict access to trusted users and services. Regularly
  audit and update your IAM policies to reflect changes in your data landscape.
