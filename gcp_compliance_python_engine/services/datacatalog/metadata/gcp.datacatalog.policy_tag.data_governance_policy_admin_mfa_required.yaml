service: datacatalog
resource: policy_tag
requirement: Data Governance Policy Admin MFA Required
scope: datacatalog.policy_tag.authentication
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Enforce MFA for Data Governance Policy Admins
rationale: Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Data Governance Policy
  Admins in Google Cloud's Data Catalog reduces the risk of unauthorized access to
  sensitive data classification and tagging policies. This measure protects against
  credential theft and insider threats, which can lead to data breaches, regulatory
  non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether MFA is enforced for users with administrative
  privileges on Data Catalog policy tags. Administrators must enable MFA in their
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings, ensuring an additional layer of security.
  To verify compliance, review IAM policies for admin roles and confirm that MFA is
  enabled. Remediation involves configuring IAM settings to enforce MFA for all users
  with 'roles/datacatalog.policyTagAdmin' permissions.
