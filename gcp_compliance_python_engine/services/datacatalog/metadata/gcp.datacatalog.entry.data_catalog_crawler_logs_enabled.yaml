title: Enable Data Catalog Crawler Logs for Enhanced Monitoring
rationale: Enabling Data Catalog Crawler Logs is crucial for monitoring and auditing
  data access patterns, which helps in identifying unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. It aids in compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC
  2 by maintaining a detailed audit trail. This logging capability supports proactive
  security measures by providing insights into data management activities.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for Data Catalog crawlers to monitor
  their activity. Specifically, it ensures that crawler logs are captured and stored
  in Google Cloud Logging. To verify, navigate to the Data Catalog service in the
  Google Cloud Console and ensure logging is configured for crawler activities. Remediation
  involves setting up logging by configuring the appropriate IAM roles and enabling
  logging in the Data Catalog settings to capture all crawler-related activities.
