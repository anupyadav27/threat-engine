title: Review Cross-Account Sharing in Data Catalog Entry Groups
rationale: Cross-account sharing of data catalog entry groups without proper governance
  can lead to unauthorized data access, resulting in potential data breaches and compliance
  violations. This is particularly critical when considering sensitive data governed
  by regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, where data sharing must be scrutinized and
  controlled to prevent unauthorized disclosures.
description: This rule checks for entry groups in GCP Data Catalog that are shared
  across accounts, ensuring a governance review is in place for such configurations.
  It examines IAM policies associated with entry groups to identify cross-account
  access and recommends a review process to validate necessity and compliance with
  data governance policies. Remediation involves auditing the IAM policies, consulting
  stakeholders for data-sharing requirements, and removing unnecessary cross-account
  permissions.
