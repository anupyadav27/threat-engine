rule_id: gcp.datacatalog.entry.data_catalog_dev_endpoint_role_least_privilege
service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Dev Endpoint Role Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Dev Endpoint Role
rationale: Enforcing least privilege for Data Catalog roles minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Over-privileged roles can lead
  to accidental or malicious data exposure, violating compliance standards such as
  GDPR and CCPA, and could result in significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that the Data Catalog Dev Endpoint role has permissions
  limited to only those necessary for development activities. Verify role assignments
  to ensure they do not include unnecessary permissions such as 'roles/datacatalog.admin'.
  Remediation involves auditing current roles and removing any excessive permissions,
  ensuring they align with the principle of least privilege.
