title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Entry Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in Data Catalog is critical to minimize
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. By restricting
  permissions to only what is necessary, organizations can reduce the attack surface
  and comply with regulatory requirements like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent
  data access controls.
description: This rule checks if the Data Catalog entry permissions adhere to the
  principle of least privilege. It verifies that roles assigned to users or service
  accounts are limited to essential access only. To remediate, review current IAM
  policies on Data Catalog entries and adjust permissions to ensure users have only
  the minimum necessary access. Audit logs should be enabled to monitor any unauthorized
  access attempts.
