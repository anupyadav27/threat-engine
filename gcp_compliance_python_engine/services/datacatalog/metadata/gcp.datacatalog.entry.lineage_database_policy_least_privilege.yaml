title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Lineage Database Policies
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in Data Catalog lineage databases reduces
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure or modification, which can lead to data breaches,
  non-compliance with data protection regulations, and potential financial and reputational
  damage. This principle helps ensure that users and services have only the permissions
  necessary to perform their intended functions, mitigating the impact of compromised
  accounts or insider threats.
description: This rule checks that Data Catalog entry policies for lineage databases
  are configured with the least privilege principle. Specifically, it verifies that
  permissions granted to users and services are restricted to only those necessary
  for their roles. To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies to remove excessive
  permissions and ensure alignment with organizational access control policies. Regularly
  audit and update these policies to reflect changes in user roles or data access
  requirements.
