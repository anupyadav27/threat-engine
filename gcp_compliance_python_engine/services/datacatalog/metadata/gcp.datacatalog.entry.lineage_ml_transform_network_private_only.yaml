subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Lineage ML Transform Uses Private Network Only
rationale: Restricting Lineage ML Transform operations to private networks mitigates
  risks associated with unauthorized access and data exfiltration. This control is
  crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with privacy regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data security measures. It also
  aligns with best practices for minimizing exposure to the public internet, reducing
  potential attack vectors.
description: This rule verifies that all Lineage ML Transform operations within Google
  Cloud Data Catalog are configured to use private network endpoints exclusively.
  To achieve this, ensure that the network configuration for the Data Catalog entries
  associated with ML transforms does not include public IP addresses. Verify by checking
  the network settings in the GCP Console for each relevant entry and update configurations
  to restrict access to private IP ranges. Remediation involves modifying network
  settings to disable public access and enable private Google Access for VPCs.
