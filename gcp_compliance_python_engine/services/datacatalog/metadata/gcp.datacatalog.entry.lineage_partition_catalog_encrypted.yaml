domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Lineage Partition Catalog is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting the Lineage Partition Catalog data at rest mitigates risks associated
  with unauthorized data access and breaches. This practice supports compliance with
  data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring sensitive metadata remains
  confidential. Failure to encrypt can expose organizations to potential data theft
  and legal penalties.
description: This rule verifies that Lineage Partition Catalog within Google Cloud
  Data Catalog is encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To check
  compliance, ensure that all Data Catalog entries have encryption configured in their
  metadata settings. Remediation involves configuring the Data Catalog service to
  use CMEK for encrypting data at rest, which can be done via the GCP Console or gcloud
  CLI.
