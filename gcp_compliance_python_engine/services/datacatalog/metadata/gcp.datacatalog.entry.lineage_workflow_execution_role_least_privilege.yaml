severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Lineage Role
rationale: Granting excessive permissions to the Lineage Workflow Execution Role in
  Data Catalog can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This
  increases the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as
  GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent data access controls. Minimizing permissions
  aligns with the principle of least privilege, reducing potential attack vectors
  and safeguarding sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that the Lineage Workflow Execution Role in Data Catalog
  is configured with the minimum necessary permissions. Review the IAM policies associated
  with this role to ensure they are restrictive yet sufficient for operational needs.
  Remediation involves auditing current permissions, removing any superfluous roles,
  and implementing more granular IAM policies to align with least privilege principles.
