title: Enable Lineage Crawler Logs in Data Catalog
rationale: Enabling Lineage Crawler Logs in Data Catalog is crucial for maintaining
  an audit trail of data access and modifications. This logging feature helps in detecting
  unauthorized access, meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, and
  enhancing data governance by providing visibility into data lineage and usage patterns.
description: This rule checks whether Lineage Crawler Logs are enabled for Data Catalog
  entries. Ensuring these logs are active involves verifying that audit logging is
  configured to capture lineage crawler activities. To enable logging, navigate to
  the GCP Console, access the Data Catalog settings, and ensure the audit logs for
  lineage crawlers are turned on. This setup aids in monitoring data flow and identifying
  potential security incidents.
