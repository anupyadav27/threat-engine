title: Ensure Least Privilege for Datalake Data Quality Roles in Data Catalog
rationale: Implementing least privilege for datalake roles mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches, protecting sensitive data and maintaining data integrity.
  Over-privileged roles can lead to inadvertent data exposure, non-compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, and potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if roles assigned to manage datalake data quality in
  Data Catalog adhere to the principle of least privilege. Specifically, it verifies
  that roles are configured to only allow necessary permissions for data quality tasks
  without granting excessive access. To remediate, review and update IAM policies
  to ensure roles are strictly aligned with job functions, using predefined roles
  where possible and custom roles when necessary. Regular audits and adjustments should
  be conducted to maintain compliance with this principle.
