resource: entry
requirement: Data Governance Export Destination Encrypted

domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Governance Export Destinations are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting export destinations in Google Data Catalog mitigates risks of
  unauthorized data access and potential data breaches, ensuring compliance with data
  protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Encrypting data at rest is crucial
  for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity in the event of unauthorized
  access or system compromise.
description: This rule checks whether export destinations for data governance within
  Google Data Catalog are encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
  or Google-managed encryption keys (GMEK). To verify, ensure that the export destination
  storage buckets or databases are configured with encryption at rest. Remediation
  involves enabling or enforcing encryption settings on these resources to secure
  sensitive data.
