title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Quality Execution Role
rationale: Assigning excessive privileges to roles can lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Ensuring that the Data Quality Recommendation Run Execution
  Role adheres to the principle of least privilege is crucial to minimize risk exposure
  and meet compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001. This practice not
  only protects sensitive data but also helps in maintaining audit trails and preventing
  privilege escalation attacks.
description: This check verifies that the Data Quality Recommendation Run Execution
  Role in Google Cloud Data Catalog is configured with the least privilege necessary
  to perform its tasks. Specifically, it examines permissions assigned to the role
  to ensure they are limited to only what is required for executing data quality recommendations.
  To remediate, review and adjust the role's permissions in the IAM policy to remove
  any unnecessary access rights. Regular audits and updates to permissions are recommended
  to maintain security posture.
