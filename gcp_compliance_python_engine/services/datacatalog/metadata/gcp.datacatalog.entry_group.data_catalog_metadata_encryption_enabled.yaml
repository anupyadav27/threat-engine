service: datacatalog
resource: entry_group
requirement: Data Catalog Metadata Encryption Enabled
scope: datacatalog.entry_group.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Data Catalog Metadata Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Encrypting metadata in Data Catalog protects sensitive information from
  unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Metadata often contains critical business
  insights and intellectual property, making its protection essential to maintain
  organizational privacy and data integrity.
description: This rule checks that metadata within GCP Data Catalog entry groups is
  encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption
  keys (GMEK) to safeguard data at rest. To verify, ensure that the entry group settings
  specify an encryption key. Remediation involves configuring the Data Catalog to
  use CMEK or GMEK by accessing the 'entry group' configuration in the GCP Console
  or using the gcloud CLI to set the necessary encryption options.
