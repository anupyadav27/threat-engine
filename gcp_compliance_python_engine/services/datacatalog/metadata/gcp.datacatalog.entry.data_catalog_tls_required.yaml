title: Ensure TLS is Required for Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Requiring TLS for Data Catalog entries ensures that data in transit is
  encrypted, protecting sensitive metadata from interception and unauthorized access.
  This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, reducing the
  risk of data breaches, and complying with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA that
  mandate encryption of data in transit.
description: This rule checks if TLS is required for all interactions with Data Catalog
  entries to ensure secure communication. To verify, inspect the network configuration
  settings of your Data Catalog service to confirm that TLS is enforced. Remediation
  involves configuring your service to require TLS by enabling endpoints that support
  HTTPS and disabling any non-encrypted endpoints. This ensures that all data transmissions
  are encrypted.
