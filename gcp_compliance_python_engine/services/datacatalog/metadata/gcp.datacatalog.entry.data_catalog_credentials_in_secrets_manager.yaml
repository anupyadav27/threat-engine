title: Ensure Data Catalog Credentials are Stored in Secrets Manager
rationale: Storing Data Catalog credentials in Secrets Manager prevents unauthorized
  access and reduces the risk of credential leakage. This practice aligns with security
  best practices and compliance requirements, protecting sensitive data from being
  exposed through insecure storage methods, thus mitigating potential data breaches
  and ensuring regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks if Data Catalog credentials are securely stored in Google
  Cloud Secrets Manager. Ensure that all credentials related to Data Catalog entries
  are not hardcoded or stored in plaintext but are instead managed by Secrets Manager.
  To verify, audit the storage locations of your Data Catalog credentials and migrate
  any found outside of Secrets Manager. Remediation involves using the Secrets Manager
  API or Console to create secret entries for these credentials and updating your
  applications to fetch them securely.
