title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Lineage Jobs
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to Data Catalog lineage jobs
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. This
  is critical for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, especially in environments
  subject to regulatory compliance such as GDPR or HIPAA. Misconfigured permissions
  can lead to over-privileged roles that expose sensitive data or disrupt operations.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles associated with Data Catalog lineage
  jobs are configured with the minimal set of permissions required for their function.
  Verify that roles do not have excessive permissions by auditing IAM policies linked
  to Data Catalog entries for lineage jobs. Remediate by adjusting IAM policies in
  Google Cloud Console or via gcloud CLI to limit access to necessary resources only.
