service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Database Cross Account Sharing Restricted
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Restrict Data Catalog Database Cross Account Sharing
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Data Catalog entries minimizes unauthorized
  access risks, protects sensitive data from exposure, and helps maintain data sovereignty.
  It is crucial to control who can access and share data across accounts to prevent
  data breaches and comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if there are policies allowing cross-account sharing
  of Data Catalog database entries. To verify, review IAM policies and ensure that
  permissions for sharing entries are limited to trusted accounts only. Remediation
  involves adjusting IAM policies to restrict sharing permissions and applying least
  privilege principles to Data Catalog entries.
