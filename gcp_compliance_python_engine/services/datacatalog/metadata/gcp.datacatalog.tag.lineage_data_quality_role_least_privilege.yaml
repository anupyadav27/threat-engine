title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Lineage Data Quality Role
rationale: Implementing least privilege for roles in GCP Data Catalog is crucial to
  minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Over-permissioned
  roles can lead to data leaks, non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA,
  and increased attack surface for malicious insiders. Ensuring roles are tightly
  scoped helps protect sensitive data and maintains trust with customers and partners.
description: This rule checks that the roles assigned to users or service accounts
  for managing lineage data quality in Data Catalog adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. It ensures that permissions are limited to only those necessary for their
  job functions. Administrators should regularly audit IAM policies associated with
  Data Catalog tags and adjust them to prevent excessive permissions, thus reducing
  the risk of unauthorized actions. Remediation involves modifying IAM policies to
  remove unnecessary permissions, using predefined roles where possible, and employing
  custom roles only when absolutely necessary.
