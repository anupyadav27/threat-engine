title: Ensure Lineage Store Encryption in Data Catalog Entry Groups
rationale: Encrypting lineage data in GCP Data Catalog is crucial for protecting sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Encryption at
  rest helps mitigate risks associated with data exfiltration and ensures compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate safeguarding
  personal and sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that all lineage store data within GCP Data Catalog
  entry groups are encrypted at rest. By default, GCP encrypts data using Google-managed
  keys, but organizations can enhance security by using customer-managed encryption
  keys (CMEK). To verify and configure this setting, navigate to the Data Catalog
  settings and ensure that the 'lineage store encryption' option is enabled. Remediation
  involves setting up CMEK through Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) and associating
  it with your Data Catalog entry group.
