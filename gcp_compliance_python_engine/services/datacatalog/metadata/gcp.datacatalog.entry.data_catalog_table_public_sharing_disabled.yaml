title: Prevent Public Sharing of Data Catalog Tables
rationale: Disabling public sharing of Data Catalog tables is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive information, which could lead to data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulatory standards. Publicly accessible tables can expose critical business
  and customer data, increasing the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. Compliance
  with frameworks such as NIST, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001 often requires strict access
  controls to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks for any Data Catalog tables that are publicly accessible
  and ensures public sharing is disabled. Verify that no tables have IAM policies
  granting 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' roles. Remediation involves reviewing
  the IAM policies of each Data Catalog table and removing any permissions that allow
  public access. Use the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to audit and adjust permissions
  as necessary.
