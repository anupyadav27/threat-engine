title: Prevent Plaintext Secrets in Data Quality Rule Parameters
rationale: Storing secrets in plaintext within Data Catalog tags can expose sensitive
  information to unauthorized users, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  Protecting secrets is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity,
  especially in highly regulated environments where data privacy laws like GDPR and
  HIPAA apply.
description: This rule checks that Data Quality Rule Parameters in Data Catalog tags
  do not contain plaintext secrets, such as API keys or passwords. It ensures that
  any sensitive information is encrypted or stored securely using Google Cloud's Secret
  Manager. To remediate, verify the tags do not include plaintext secrets and migrate
  any such data to a secure storage solution, updating references in your applications
  accordingly.
