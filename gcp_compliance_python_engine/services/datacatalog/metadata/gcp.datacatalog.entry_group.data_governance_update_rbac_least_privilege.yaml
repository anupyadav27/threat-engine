title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Catalog Entry Group Updates
rationale: Ensuring least privilege access to Data Catalog entry groups is critical
  to prevent unauthorized modifications which can lead to data exposure or integrity
  issues. Misconfigured permissions can increase the risk of data breaches, violate
  compliance regulations, and ultimately result in financial and reputational damage.
  Implementing precise RBAC policies helps in aligning with compliance frameworks
  and securing sensitive data effectively.
description: This rule verifies that only necessary roles are granted permissions
  to update Data Catalog entry groups, aligning with the principle of least privilege.
  Check IAM policies to ensure that roles like Viewer and Metadata Viewer do not have
  unnecessary update permissions. Remediate by auditing current role assignments and
  adjusting permissions using `gcloud` commands or the GCP Console to restrict update
  capabilities to roles like Editor or Owner only when justified.
