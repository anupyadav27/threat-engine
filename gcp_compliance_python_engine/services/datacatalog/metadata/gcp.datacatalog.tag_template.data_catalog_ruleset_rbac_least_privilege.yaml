title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Tag Template Roles
rationale: Implementing least privilege in Data Catalog tag templates minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. By restricting permissions to only those necessary for specific
  roles, organizations reduce their attack surface and maintain better control over
  sensitive metadata.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to Data Catalog tag templates adhere
  to the principle of least privilege. Review permissions granted to users and service
  accounts to ensure they are limited to necessary actions such as viewing or editing
  tags. Remediate by adjusting IAM policies to restrict roles to essential operations
  only, using predefined roles where possible. Verification can be done through the
  GCP Console or gcloud CLI by examining IAM policy bindings on tag templates.
