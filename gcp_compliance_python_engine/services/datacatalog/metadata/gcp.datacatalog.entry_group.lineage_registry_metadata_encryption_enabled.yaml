subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Lineage Registry Metadata Encryption is Enabled
rationale: Enabling encryption for Lineage Registry Metadata in GCP Data Catalog is
  crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  This measure mitigates risks associated with data exposure and helps meet compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection standards.
  Encrypting metadata at rest reduces the attack surface, safeguarding data integrity
  and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for Lineage Registry Metadata
  in GCP Data Catalog's entry groups. It verifies that the metadata is encrypted using
  Google-managed keys or customer-managed keys, ensuring that data is protected at
  rest. To enable encryption, configure the entry group's settings to use the appropriate
  key management service. Verification involves reviewing the Data Catalog settings
  to confirm the encryption status and the key type in use. Remediation requires updating
  the settings to enforce encryption if not already enabled.
