title: Ensure Data Catalog Tag Template Ruleset Version is Pinned
rationale: Pinning the version of a Data Catalog ruleset ensures consistency and reliability
  in data classification and governance processes. Unpinned versions may lead to unexpected
  behavior and potential security risks as changes in newer versions could introduce
  vulnerabilities or non-compliance with data governance policies.
description: This rule checks whether the Data Catalog tag templates have their ruleset
  versions explicitly pinned. To verify, review the tag templates in the Data Catalog
  to ensure each has a specific ruleset version defined. Remediation involves updating
  the tag templates to specify a version number, thereby preventing automatic upgrades
  that could disrupt data governance operations.
