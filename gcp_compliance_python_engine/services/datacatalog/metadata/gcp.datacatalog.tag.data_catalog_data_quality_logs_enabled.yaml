title: Enable Data Quality Logs in GCP Data Catalog
rationale: Enabling data quality logs in Google Cloud's Data Catalog is crucial for
  maintaining visibility into data integrity and compliance. Without these logs, organizations
  may face challenges in identifying data anomalies, auditing data-related activities,
  and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. This logging capability
  helps mitigate risks associated with data breaches and ensures accountability in
  data management processes.
description: This rule verifies that data quality logs are enabled for tags in Google
  Cloud's Data Catalog. To ensure this setting, navigate to the Data Catalog settings
  in the GCP Console and enable logging for data quality. This allows for comprehensive
  monitoring and auditing of data quality issues. Remediation involves adjusting the
  configuration settings to activate logging, ensuring that all data interactions
  are recorded for future analysis and compliance audits.
