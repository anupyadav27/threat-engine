title: Enable Datalake Crawler Logs in Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Enabling Datalake Crawler Logs is crucial for maintaining visibility into
  data access and modification activities within GCP's Data Catalog. Without logging,
  organizations cannot effectively monitor or audit data interactions, leading to
  potential compliance violations and an increased risk of undetected data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for datalake crawler entries
  in the GCP Data Catalog. To verify, ensure that audit logs for Data Catalog are
  activated, capturing all reads, writes, and administrative actions. Remediation
  involves configuring the appropriate IAM permissions and enabling audit logging
  in the Cloud Console under the Logging section of the Data Catalog settings.
