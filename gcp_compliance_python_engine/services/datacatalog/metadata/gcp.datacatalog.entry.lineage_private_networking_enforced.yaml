title: Ensure Lineage Private Networking is Enforced for Data Catalog
rationale: Enforcing private networking for data catalog lineage ensures that metadata
  is not exposed to the public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. This control aligns with best practices for network
  security by minimizing attack surfaces and is crucial for meeting compliance requirements
  related to data protection and privacy, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that Data Catalog lineage entries are configured to
  use private networking, which restricts access to resources via Google Cloud's internal
  network. To achieve this, ensure that the entry's network settings are configured
  to use VPC Service Controls or Private Google Access. Verification involves checking
  the network configurations in the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud CLI. Remediation
  includes updating the network settings to enforce private networking for all lineage
  data.
