severity: high
title: Enable Encryption for Datalake Registry Metadata
rationale: Ensuring encryption for datalake registry metadata protects sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This is crucial for mitigating
  risks such as data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation, while also fulfilling
  compliance requirements like GDPR, which mandate data protection and privacy. Encryption
  at rest is a key control for defending against insider threats and external attacks.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for datalake registry
  metadata within Google Cloud's Data Catalog. To verify, ensure that the entry group's
  metadata is encrypted using Cloud KMS keys. This can be configured by setting the
  'kmsKeyName' field in the entry group settings. Remediation involves using Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool to update the entry group configuration
  to include a valid KMS key for encryption.
