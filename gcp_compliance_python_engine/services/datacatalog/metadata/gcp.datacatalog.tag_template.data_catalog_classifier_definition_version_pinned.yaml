title: Ensure Data Catalog Classifier Version is Pinned
rationale: Pinning the Data Catalog classifier definition version is crucial to maintain
  consistent and predictable metadata tagging across data assets. It helps mitigate
  risks associated with unexpected changes that could result in misclassification
  of data, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure or compliance violations.
  This control supports maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulations
  that require strict data classification protocols.
description: This rule checks if the Data Catalog classifier definition version is
  pinned in tag templates. A pinned version ensures that the metadata tagging behavior
  remains consistent, preventing potential breakdowns in data governance strategies.
  To verify, review the tag template configurations in the Data Catalog and ensure
  the classifier version is explicitly specified. If not pinned, update the tag template
  to a specific version, documented and tested, to prevent discrepancies during metadata
  tagging operations.
