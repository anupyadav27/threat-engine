title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Lineage Registry
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for the Data Catalog Lineage Registry
  is crucial to minimize potential data breaches and unauthorized access. By restricting
  permissions to only what is necessary, organizations can reduce the risk of data
  leaks, maintain the integrity of lineage data, and comply with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to users or service accounts on
  Data Catalog entry groups related to the Lineage Registry adhere to the principle
  of least privilege. Specifically, it verifies that entities are not granted more
  permissions than necessary to perform their job functions. To remediate, review
  IAM policies and remove unnecessary roles or privileges from users and service accounts.
  Utilize IAM Recommender for identifying and revoking excessive permissions.
