requirement: Datalake Access RBAC Least Privilege

subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Datalake Access Uses RBAC with Least Privilege
rationale: Implementing RBAC with least privilege for datalake access in GCP's Data
  Catalog reduces the risk of unauthorized data manipulation and exposure, ensuring
  sensitive information is accessed only by necessary personnel. This aligns with
  compliance mandates like GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict access controls to
  protect personal and sensitive data, thereby mitigating the risk of data breaches
  and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks that access to datalake entries in GCP Data Catalog
  is configured using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with the principle of least
  privilege. Verify that only necessary roles are assigned to users or service accounts,
  and regularly audit permissions to ensure relevance. Remediation involves reviewing
  IAM policies within the Data Catalog, removing excessive permissions, and assigning
  roles that align with user responsibilities.
