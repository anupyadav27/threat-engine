service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Database Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.entry.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Encryption of Data Catalog Database Entries
rationale: Encrypting Data Catalog entries protects sensitive metadata from unauthorized
  access, reducing the risk of data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining customer
  trust and adhering to regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate
  the protection of personal data. Encryption at rest ensures that even if physical
  drives are compromised, the data remains protected.
description: This rule checks whether entries in the Data Catalog have encryption
  enabled. It requires configuring the Data Catalog to use Google-managed or customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt metadata at rest. To verify, inspect the encryption
  settings of Data Catalog entries in the GCP Console or via the gcloud command line.
  Remediation involves enabling encryption on existing entries or ensuring new entries
  are configured with encryption from the start.
