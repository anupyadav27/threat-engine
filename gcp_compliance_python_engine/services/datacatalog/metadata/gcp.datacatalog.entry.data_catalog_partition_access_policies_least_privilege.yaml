rule_id: gcp.datacatalog.entry.data_catalog_partition_access_policies_least_privilege
service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Partition Access Policies Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Partition Access
rationale: Minimizing access to Data Catalog entries reduces the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and potential misuse. Implementing least privilege principles helps
  protect sensitive data, maintain compliance with regulatory standards, and mitigate
  the impact of insider threats or compromised credentials.
description: This rule checks for Data Catalog entries to ensure that access policies
  are configured with the principle of least privilege. It verifies that only necessary
  permissions are granted to users, groups, or service accounts for data partitions.
  To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies to align with the minimum access required
  for each role, removing unnecessary permissions and ensuring proper logging for
  audit purposes.
