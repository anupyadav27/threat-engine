title: Ensure Lineage Rule Source in Data Catalog is Trusted
rationale: Ensuring the source of lineage rules within Data Catalog is trusted helps
  protect against unauthorized data access and manipulation. This is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and privacy, as well as for compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and CCPA that require stringent data protection measures. Untrusted sources may
  introduce security vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches and financial
  penalties.
description: This rule checks whether the sources of lineage rules in Data Catalog's
  tag templates are from trusted origins. To verify, review the lineage rules associated
  with your tag templates and confirm they originate from known, secure sources. Remediation
  involves configuring access controls to restrict the creation of lineage rules to
  trusted entities only, and auditing existing rules for compliance with security
  policies.
