resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Dev Endpoint No Public Access
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: critical
title: Restrict Public Access to Data Catalog Dev Endpoints
rationale: Allowing public access to Data Catalog development endpoints can expose
  sensitive metadata and configuration details to unauthorized users, leading to potential
  data breaches and compliance violations. By restricting public access, organizations
  can reduce attack surfaces and meet regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and PCI-DSS that mandate controlled access to sensitive data.
description: This rule checks for public access configurations on Data Catalog development
  endpoints to ensure they are not exposed to the internet. Verify that access policies
  for Data Catalog entries are set to deny public access by default. Remediation involves
  reviewing IAM roles and permissions to ensure that only authorized users within
  the organization can access these endpoints. Implement firewall rules and network
  policies to further enforce restricted access.
