title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Catalog Database Policies
rationale: Implementing least privilege in Data Catalog helps minimize potential unauthorized
  access to sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  compliance with regulatory requirements like GDPR and CCPA. Misconfigured permissions
  can lead to data exposure, which could result in significant financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks that policies applied to Data Catalog entries grant
  only the necessary permissions required for users to perform their job functions.
  It involves verifying IAM roles assigned to users and service accounts against the
  principle of least privilege. To remediate, audit existing IAM policies and adjust
  permissions to ensure they are strictly necessary, using predefined roles where
  possible. Regularly review and update policies to adapt to changes in user roles
  or organizational requirements.
