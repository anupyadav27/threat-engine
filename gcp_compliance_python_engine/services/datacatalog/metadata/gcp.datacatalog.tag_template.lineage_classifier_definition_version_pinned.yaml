title: Ensure Lineage Classifier Definition Version is Pinned
rationale: Pinning the lineage classifier definition version in Data Catalog ensures
  consistency and integrity of data classification processes. Unpinned versions may
  lead to unintentional updates, potentially exposing sensitive data or causing compliance
  violations. This practice supports data governance and mitigates risks associated
  with unauthorized data access.
description: This rule verifies that the lineage classifier definition version in
  Data Catalog's tag templates is explicitly pinned. To check, review the tag template
  configurations to ensure a fixed version number is specified. If not pinned, update
  the tag template settings in the Google Cloud Console or via gcloud command-line
  to include a version identifier. This prevents automatic updates to newer, untested
  versions which could introduce vulnerabilities.
