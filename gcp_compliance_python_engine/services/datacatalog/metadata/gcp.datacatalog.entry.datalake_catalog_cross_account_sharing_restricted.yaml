title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Cross-account sharing of Data Catalog entries can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, impacting business integrity and compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Limiting this access ensures
  that sensitive metadata and data lake information are only available to approved
  accounts, reducing the risk of data exfiltration.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow cross-account sharing
  of Data Catalog entries in GCP, which should be restricted to prevent unauthorized
  access. Verify that IAM policies do not grant cross-account access to Data Catalog
  entries. Remediation involves reviewing and updating IAM roles and policies to ensure
  they align with least privilege principles, and auditing logs to detect unauthorized
  access attempts.
