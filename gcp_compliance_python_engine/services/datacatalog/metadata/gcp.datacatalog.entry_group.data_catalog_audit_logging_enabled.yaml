title: Ensure Data Catalog Audit Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Data Catalog entry groups is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into data access and modifications. It helps identify unauthorized access
  attempts, supports forensic analysis in the event of a data breach, and ensures
  compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA that require detailed logging
  of data access activities.
description: This rule checks if audit logging is enabled for Data Catalog entry groups
  on GCP. Audit logs capture all read and write operations, providing an audit trail
  of interactions with data assets. To verify, ensure that audit logs for the Data
  Catalog service are configured in the GCP Console under 'Audit Logs' settings. Remediation
  involves enabling 'Admin Read', 'Data Read', and 'Data Write' logs for Data Catalog
  in the Cloud Console.
