title: Restrict Cross Account Trusts in Data Catalog Workflows
rationale: Cross-account trusts in Data Catalog workflows can lead to unauthorized
  access and data leakage if not properly managed. Restricting these trusts reduces
  the risk of data exposure and ensures that data processing workflows are only accessed
  by authorized accounts, aligning with compliance obligations and minimizing potential
  attack vectors.
description: This rule checks for configurations in Data Catalog entries where cross-account
  trusts are allowed in workflows. Ensure that only necessary accounts have trust
  relationships and that all accounts involved are vetted and monitored. To verify,
  review the IAM policies associated with Data Catalog entries and ensure that cross-account
  permissions are minimized. Remediation involves editing IAM policies to limit trust
  relationships and implementing audit logging to monitor access patterns.
