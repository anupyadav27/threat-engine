title: Ensure Data Quality Rule Definition Version is Pinned
rationale: Pinning data quality rule definitions is crucial to maintain consistency
  and reliability in data quality assessments. Without version control, changes could
  inadvertently affect data integrity, leading to potential data mishandling, and
  impact compliance with standards like GDPR or HIPAA. This control helps mitigate
  the risk of unauthorized or accidental changes that could compromise data protection
  and privacy.
description: This rule checks whether the data quality rule definitions in Data Catalog
  tags are pinned to a specific version. To verify, inspect the Data Catalog configurations
  for tag templates and ensure each rule definition is associated with a fixed version.
  Remediate by updating rule definitions to specify a version, preventing unintended
  impacts from future updates.
