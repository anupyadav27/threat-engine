title: Enable Data Catalog Lineage Data Quality Logs
rationale: Enabling lineage data quality logs in GCP's Data Catalog helps organizations
  maintain visibility into data asset changes and ensure data integrity. This is crucial
  for identifying potential data quality issues and unauthorized access attempts,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if lineage data quality logging is enabled for Data
  Catalog tags in GCP. When enabled, it captures detailed logs about data lineage
  and quality, which can be used for auditing and debugging purposes. Administrators
  can verify this setting through the GCP Console by navigating to the Data Catalog
  settings and ensuring 'Lineage Data Quality Logs' is turned on. To enable, go to
  the specific Data Catalog entry, access the settings, and activate logging for lineage
  data quality.
