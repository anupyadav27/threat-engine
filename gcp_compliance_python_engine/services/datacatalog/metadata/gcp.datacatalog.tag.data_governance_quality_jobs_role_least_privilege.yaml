subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Governance Quality Jobs Role
rationale: Implementing least privilege for roles managing Data Catalog tags minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data access or modification, protecting sensitive metadata
  from internal and external threats. This approach supports compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls to safeguard data privacy
  and integrity.
description: This rule checks that roles assigned to manage Data Catalog tags for
  data governance quality jobs adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure
  that only essential permissions are granted, such as 'datacatalog.tags.create' and
  'datacatalog.tags.update', and avoid broader permissions that are unnecessary for
  the task. Regularly audit permissions using IAM policy analysis and adjust roles
  to remove excessive privileges. Remediation involves using the Google Cloud Console,
  IAM Policy Analyzer, or gcloud CLI to refine role permissions.
