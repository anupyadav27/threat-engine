title: Enable Data Catalog Entry Trigger Logs
rationale: Enabling trigger logs for Data Catalog entries is crucial for tracking
  changes and access patterns, which helps in identifying unauthorized access or modifications.
  This enhances data governance and compliance with regulatory requirements such as
  GDPR and CCPA, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring accountability.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for Data Catalog entries,
  ensuring all interactions are logged. To verify, ensure the 'dataAccess' audit logs
  are enabled in the Cloud Audit Logs for the Data Catalog service. Remediation involves
  navigating to the IAM & Admin section of the GCP Console, accessing the Audit Logs
  settings, and enabling 'dataAccess' logs for Data Catalog.
