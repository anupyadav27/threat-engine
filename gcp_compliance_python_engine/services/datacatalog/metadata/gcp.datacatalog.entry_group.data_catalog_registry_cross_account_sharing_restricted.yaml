title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in Data Catalog
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing in Data Catalog is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive metadata. Cross-account sharing can lead to accidental
  data exposure and increase the risk of data breaches. It helps in maintaining compliance
  with data protection regulations by ensuring that only authorized accounts have
  access to specific metadata entries.
description: This rule checks that Data Catalog Entry Groups are not shared across
  different GCP accounts unless explicitly required. To verify, review the IAM policies
  attached to the Entry Groups and ensure they do not grant permissions to external
  accounts. Remediation involves auditing current sharing settings and updating IAM
  policies to restrict access to trusted accounts only. Implement least privilege
  access and regularly monitor access logs to detect any unauthorized sharing activities.
