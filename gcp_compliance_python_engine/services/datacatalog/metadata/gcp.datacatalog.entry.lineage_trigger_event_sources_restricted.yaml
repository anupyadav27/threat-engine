title: Restrict Lineage Trigger Event Sources in Data Catalog
rationale: Restricting lineage trigger event sources is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  data modifications and lineage tracking from untrusted sources. This enhances data
  integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk of exposure to data breaches and
  ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. It helps
  organizations maintain trust with stakeholders by safeguarding sensitive data.
description: This rule checks if Data Catalog entries have restricted lineage trigger
  event sources. Ensure that only trusted and necessary services are allowed to trigger
  lineage events to prevent unauthorized data access. To verify, review the Data Catalog
  entry settings and configure access policies to limit event sources. Remediation
  involves setting IAM policies that explicitly grant permissions to trusted services
  and users only.
