title: Restrict Event Sources for Data Catalog Triggers
rationale: Restricting event sources for Data Catalog triggers is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized data access and manipulation, which could lead to data breaches and
  non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Unrestricted event sources
  increase the risk of accidental or malicious data exposure, impacting business operations
  and damaging trust.
description: This rule checks that only approved event sources are allowed to trigger
  actions within the Google Cloud Data Catalog. Ensure that event source restrictions
  are configured by setting appropriate IAM roles and permissions, limiting who can
  create and modify these triggers. Remediation involves auditing existing triggers,
  removing non-essential sources, and implementing least privilege access for those
  that remain.
