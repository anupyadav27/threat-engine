title: Ensure Data Catalog Datalake Capture is Enabled
rationale: Enabling Datalake Capture in Google Cloud Data Catalog ensures that all
  metadata and data lineage information is securely captured and stored. This feature
  helps in data governance, compliance with data protection regulations, and reduces
  the risk of data breaches by maintaining an auditable trail of data access and modifications.
description: This rule verifies that Datalake Capture is enabled for entries in Google
  Cloud Data Catalog. Enabling this feature ensures that metadata changes, data lineage,
  and access patterns are logged and preserved. To verify, check the Data Catalog
  settings under the Datalake Capture configuration and ensure it is activated. If
  not enabled, configure the Data Catalog entry settings to activate Datalake Capture,
  enhancing traceability and compliance with data privacy standards.
