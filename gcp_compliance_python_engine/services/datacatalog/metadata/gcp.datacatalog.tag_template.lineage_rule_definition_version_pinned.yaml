title: Ensure Lineage Rule Version in Data Catalog is Pinned
rationale: Pinning the version of a lineage rule definition is crucial as it ensures
  that the rule's behavior remains consistent over time, preventing unexpected changes
  that could lead to data misclassification or unauthorized data access. This practice
  mitigates the risk of compliance violations by maintaining data integrity and alignment
  with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if the version of lineage rule definitions in Google
  Cloud Data Catalog tag templates is pinned. A pinned version prevents unintended
  updates which could compromise data classification accuracy. To verify, review your
  tag template settings within Data Catalog and ensure each lineage rule has a set
  version. Remediation involves specifying a fixed version number for each lineage
  rule definition in tag templates to maintain consistent data processing logic.
