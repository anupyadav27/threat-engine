title: Implement Least Privilege for Data Catalog Lineage Triggers
rationale: Ensuring that lineage triggers in GCP Data Catalog are configured with
  the least privilege principle minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Misconfigured permissions can lead to exposure of sensitive metadata,
  impacting regulatory compliance under frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2.
  By adhering to least privilege, organizations can reduce the attack surface and
  fulfill compliance obligations.
description: This rule checks whether lineage trigger targets in GCP Data Catalog
  entries are granted only the necessary permissions to perform their functions. Users
  must review and configure IAM policies to ensure that roles are limited to the essential
  permissions required for specific tasks. Remediation involves auditing current permissions,
  removing unnecessary roles, and applying more restrictive IAM roles to limit access.
  Verification can be done through the GCP Console or gcloud CLI by inspecting IAM
  settings on Data Catalog entries.
