title: Restrict Cross-Account Lineage Workflow Trusts in Data Catalog
rationale: Restricting cross-account trusts in lineage workflows is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and data leaks across different GCP accounts. Such restrictions
  help mitigate risks associated with data sovereignty and ensure compliance with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Organizations can avoid potential
  breaches and maintain control over sensitive data by enforcing strict access controls.
description: This rule ensures that cross-account trusts in Data Catalog lineage workflows
  are restricted to prevent unauthorized access to metadata entries. Verify that IAM
  policies for Data Catalog entries do not allow broad access to external accounts.
  Remediation involves reviewing IAM policies and limiting permissions to only necessary
  GCP accounts, ensuring that trust relationships are explicitly defined and scoped
  appropriately.
