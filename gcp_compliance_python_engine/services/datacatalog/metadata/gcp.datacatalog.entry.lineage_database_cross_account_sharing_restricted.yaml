title: Restrict Cross Account Data Catalog Lineage Database Sharing
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Data Catalog lineage databases is
  crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Exposing sensitive metadata
  across accounts can lead to data leakage and compliance violations, impacting business
  trust and risking penalties under regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks for any Data Catalog lineage databases shared across
  accounts and ensures that sharing is restricted to only necessary entities. Verify
  configurations by reviewing IAM policies associated with Data Catalog entries and
  adjust permissions to minimize exposure. Remediate by restricting access to specific
  roles or identities within the same account or trusted domains, following the principle
  of least privilege.
