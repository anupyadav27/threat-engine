title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Catalog Job Roles
rationale: Ensuring least privilege in Data Catalog roles minimizes the attack surface
  by restricting access to only necessary resources. This reduces potential damage
  from compromised accounts and aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and
  SOC 2, which mandate access controls and data protection. Implementing least privilege
  helps prevent unauthorized data exposure and promotes accountability by ensuring
  users operate within their defined boundaries.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the principle of least privilege in
  Data Catalog job roles. It ensures that job roles assigned to users or service accounts
  only provide the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. To verify,
  review IAM policies for Data Catalog entries and adjust them to remove unnecessary
  permissions. Remediation involves auditing current role assignments, identifying
  excessive permissions, and updating roles to align with least privilege principles.
