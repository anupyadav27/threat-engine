title: Restrict Lineage Crawler Scope to Allowlist
rationale: Restricting the Lineage Crawler to an allowlist minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and ensures adherence to data protection regulations. This limitation
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk
  of data breaches, and aligning with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that the Data Catalog Lineage Crawler's scope is restricted
  to a defined allowlist, preventing the crawler from accessing unauthorized data
  entries. To ensure compliance, configure the Lineage Crawler to only scan entries
  listed in a pre-approved allowlist. This can be verified by reviewing the crawler's
  configuration settings in the GCP Console or via API. Remediation includes updating
  the crawler configuration to specify an allowlist of trusted entries.
