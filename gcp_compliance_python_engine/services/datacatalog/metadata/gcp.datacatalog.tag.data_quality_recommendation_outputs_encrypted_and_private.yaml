requirement: Data Quality Recommendation Outputs Encrypted And Private
scope: datacatalog.tag.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Tags Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Data quality recommendation outputs in Google Cloud's Data Catalog can
  contain sensitive metadata that, if exposed, may lead to data breaches or unauthorized
  access. Encrypting these outputs and ensuring their privacy helps in mitigating
  risks such as data tampering, unauthorized exposure, and compliance violations with
  standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that data quality recommendation outputs in Data Catalog
  are encrypted using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) and are not publicly
  accessible. To ensure compliance, configure Data Catalog to use CMEK for all tags
  and verify IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users only. Remediation
  involves updating encryption settings and auditing permissions through the Google
  Cloud Console or CLI.
