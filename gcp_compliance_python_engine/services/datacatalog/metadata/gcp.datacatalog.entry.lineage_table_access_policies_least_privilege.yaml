subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Lineage Table Access Policies Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Implementing least privilege access control for lineage tables in Data
  Catalog helps minimize the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data
  breaches. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data assets and maintaining compliance
  with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict data access
  controls. By limiting access to only those who absolutely need it, organizations
  can reduce their attack surface and prevent insider threats.
description: This rule checks whether access policies for lineage tables in Google
  Cloud Data Catalog are configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It ensures that only authorized users with a legitimate need have access. To verify,
  review IAM roles and permissions assigned to Data Catalog resources and adjust them
  to limit access to the minimum necessary. Remediation involves auditing current
  access permissions, identifying unnecessary privileges, and revoking or restricting
  access accordingly.
