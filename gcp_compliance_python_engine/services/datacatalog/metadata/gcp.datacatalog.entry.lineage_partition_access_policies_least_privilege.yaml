title: Ensure Least Privilege on Data Catalog Lineage Partition Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access policies for Data Catalog lineage partitions
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. It
  helps safeguard sensitive information from insider threats and reduces the attack
  surface by limiting user permissions to only what is necessary. Compliance with
  regulatory standards like GDPR and HIPAA often mandates strict access controls to
  protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that Data Catalog lineage partitions have access policies
  configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege. It verifies that only
  users and service accounts with a legitimate need can access specific partitions.
  To remediate, review the IAM policies associated with Data Catalog entries and adjust
  permissions to ensure they are restricted to the minimum required roles. Use GCP
  IAM policy management tools to audit and modify access levels accordingly.
