service: datacatalog
resource: tag_template
requirement: Lineage Ruleset Encrypted At Rest
scope: datacatalog.tag_template.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Lineage Ruleset is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is critical to protect sensitive information from
  unauthorized access and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Without
  encryption, data stored in the cloud is vulnerable to breaches, potentially leading
  to financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.
description: This rule checks that all Lineage Rulesets associated with Data Catalog
  Tag Templates are encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed keys.
  To verify, ensure that the Encryption Configuration in the Data Catalog settings
  specifies a valid key. Remediation involves configuring the Data Catalog to use
  Cloud KMS keys for encrypting data at rest, providing an additional layer of security.
