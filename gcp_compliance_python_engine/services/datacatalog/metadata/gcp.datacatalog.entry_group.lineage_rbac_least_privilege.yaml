rule_id: gcp.datacatalog.entry_group.lineage_rbac_least_privilege
service: datacatalog
resource: entry_group
requirement: Lineage RBAC Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry_group.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Data Catalog Entry Group RBAC Follows Least Privilege
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Data Catalog entry group lineage ensures
  that users and services have only the permissions essential for their roles, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This approach mitigates potential
  insider threats and limits the blast radius in case of credential compromise, aligning
  with compliance mandates such as NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles assigned to Data Catalog entry group
  lineage follow the principle of least privilege. Verify that only necessary roles
  with limited permissions are granted to users or service accounts. Remediation involves
  reviewing IAM policies and adjusting roles to ensure that overly permissive roles
  are replaced with roles that strictly adhere to the minimum permissions needed for
  functionality.
