title: Ensure Lineage ML Transform Logs Are Enabled for Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Enabling lineage ML transform logs in Data Catalog is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into data transformations, which helps in tracking data provenance and
  ensuring data integrity. This is important for identifying unauthorized data manipulations
  and detecting potential data breaches. Moreover, it supports compliance with regulatory
  standards that require detailed data handling records.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for machine learning data
  transformations within Data Catalog entries. To ensure compliance, ensure that the
  Data Catalog service has audit logs activated to capture all ML transformation events.
  Remediation involves configuring the appropriate logging settings in the Google
  Cloud Console or via gcloud commands to ensure that lineage logs capture all necessary
  transformation details. This setup assists in monitoring and auditing data workflows
  effectively.
