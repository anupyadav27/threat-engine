title: Store Data Catalog Lineage Credentials in Secrets Manager
rationale: Storing lineage credentials in Secrets Manager helps prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive data and limits the risk of credential exposure. Failure to
  securely manage credentials can lead to data breaches, compliance violations with
  frameworks like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, and potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks if lineage credentials used in Data Catalog entries
  are securely stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager. Ensure that all lineage credentials
  are not hardcoded in the application or stored in plaintext, but instead managed
  through Secret Manager with appropriate IAM policies limiting access. Remediation
  involves migrating credentials to Secret Manager and updating applications to retrieve
  them securely.
