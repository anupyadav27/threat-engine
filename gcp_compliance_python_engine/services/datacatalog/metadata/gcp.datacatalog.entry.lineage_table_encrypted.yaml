severity: medium
title: Ensure Lineage Table Encryption in GCP Data Catalog
rationale: Encrypting lineage tables in GCP Data Catalog is crucial to protect sensitive
  metadata from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice mitigates
  risks associated with data exposure and helps organizations comply with data privacy
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential
  and secure.
description: This rule checks if lineage tables in GCP Data Catalog entries are encrypted
  using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. Verify the encryption
  status by reviewing the Data Catalog entry settings in the GCP Console or using
  the gcloud CLI. To remediate non-compliance, enable encryption at rest by configuring
  the appropriate encryption key settings for the Data Catalog entries.
