title: Ensure Datalake Classifier Definition Version is Pinned
rationale: Pinning the version of Datalake classifier definitions is crucial to maintain
  consistent data classification and prevent unauthorized or unintended changes that
  could lead to data misclassification. This helps in mitigating risks of data breaches
  and ensures compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, which
  require stringent data management controls.
description: This rule checks whether the Datalake classifier definitions within Google
  Cloud's Data Catalog have their versions pinned to avoid unexpected updates that
  might compromise data classification integrity. To verify this, check the tag template
  configurations in the Data Catalog and ensure that the classifier version is set
  to a specific version rather than 'latest'. Remediation involves explicitly setting
  the classifier definition version in the tag template configuration.
