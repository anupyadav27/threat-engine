title: Ensure Data Catalog Entries are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting Data Catalog entries at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  metadata against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This measure reduces
  the risk of data exposure, aligns with industry best practices, and helps meet compliance
  standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 that mandate encryption of sensitive
  data.
description: This rule checks whether your Data Catalog entries are configured to
  be encrypted at rest using Google-managed encryption keys (GMEK) or customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure that encryption settings are enabled for
  all entries within the Data Catalog. Remediation involves configuring the Data Catalog
  service to use GMEK by default or setting up CMEK through Cloud KMS for enhanced
  control over encryption keys.
