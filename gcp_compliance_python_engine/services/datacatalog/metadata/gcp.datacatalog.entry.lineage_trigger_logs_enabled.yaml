title: Enable Data Catalog Lineage Trigger Logs
rationale: Enabling lineage trigger logs in GCP Data Catalog provides detailed insights
  into data movement and transformations, allowing for enhanced visibility and accountability.
  This is crucial for identifying unauthorized access or anomalies, thus mitigating
  risks of data breaches. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA often
  requires detailed audit trails, making this a key component in meeting legal obligations.
description: This rule checks whether lineage trigger logs are enabled for GCP Data
  Catalog entries. To verify, ensure that the logging configuration for each Data
  Catalog entry includes lineage triggers. Remediation involves configuring the Data
  Catalog service to log all lineage events through the Google Cloud Console or via
  the CLI. This ensures all data lineage activities are captured and can be audited
  for security and compliance purposes.
