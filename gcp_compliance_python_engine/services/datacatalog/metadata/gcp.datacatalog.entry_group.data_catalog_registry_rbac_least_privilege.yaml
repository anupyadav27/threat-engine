subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Data Catalog Entry Group Follows Least Privilege Model
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in GCP Data Catalog Entry Groups mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure and manipulation. It reduces the attack surface
  by ensuring users and services have access only to the resources they need, aligning
  with compliance requirements such as GDPR and ISO 27001, thereby protecting sensitive
  business data from breaches.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles granted to Data Catalog Entry Groups
  adhere to the principle of least privilege. Verify that only necessary permissions
  are assigned by reviewing the IAM policy bindings associated with each entry group.
  Remediation involves auditing the roles and permissions and modifying IAM policies
  to remove excessive permissions, ensuring users and services have the minimum necessary
  access.
