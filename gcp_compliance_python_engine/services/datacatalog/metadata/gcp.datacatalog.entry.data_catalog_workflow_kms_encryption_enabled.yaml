title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Data Catalog Workflows
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for Data Catalog workflows is crucial to protect
  sensitive data and metadata from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  This measure helps mitigate the risk of data exposure and supports compliance with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust encryption
  for stored data.
description: This rule verifies that Google Cloud's Data Catalog workflows use Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) to encrypt data at rest. To enable this, configure your Data
  Catalog entries to utilize a KMS key from Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
  Verify the encryption settings in the Google Cloud console under the Data Catalog
  section and ensure that the 'Encryption' field indicates a KMS key. If not, update
  the configuration to attach a KMS key to the Data Catalog entry.
