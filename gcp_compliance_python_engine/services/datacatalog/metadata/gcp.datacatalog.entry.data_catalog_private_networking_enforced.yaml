title: Enforce Private Networking for Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Data Catalog entries mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access and data exposure by restricting access to a secure, internal
  network. This is crucial for protecting sensitive metadata managed within GCP's
  Data Catalog, ensuring that only authenticated internal traffic can access it. By
  aligning with best practices for network segmentation, organizations can reduce
  the attack surface and comply with security standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if private networking is enforced for Data Catalog entries,
  ensuring they are only accessible from internal IPs. To verify, inspect the network
  settings of your Data Catalog to confirm that private IPs are used and that public
  access is disabled. Remediation involves configuring VPC Service Controls and setting
  up private Google access, ensuring all access requests come from within the defined
  network perimeter.
