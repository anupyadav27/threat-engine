service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Ml Transform Network Private Only
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog ML Transform Uses Private Network
rationale: Enforcing private network usage for Data Catalog ML Transform reduces the
  risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration by restricting access to internal
  networks only. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality,
  especially when handling sensitive data subject to regulatory compliance such as
  GDPR or HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that all Data Catalog ML Transform operations are conducted
  over private networks. To verify, ensure that the Data Catalog service is configured
  to use VPC Service Controls and restricts public network access. Remediation involves
  updating network configurations to ensure that the service endpoints are only accessible
  within a private network, leveraging VPC peering or private service access.
