title: Restrict Lineage Cross Account Sharing in Data Catalog
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of lineage data in GCP Data Catalog is
  crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, which can lead to
  data leaks and compliance violations. By ensuring that lineage data is not shared
  across accounts without proper controls, organizations can mitigate risks associated
  with data privacy breaches and align with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and
  CCPA.
description: This rule checks for configurations in GCP Data Catalog where entry group
  lineage data is shared across accounts. To verify, review IAM policies associated
  with entry groups and ensure that only authorized accounts have access. Remediation
  involves refining IAM roles and permissions to limit access to lineage data, ensuring
  it is only available to trusted accounts within the organization.
