rule_id: gcp.datacatalog.entry.lineage_rbac_least_privilege
service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Lineage RBAC Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Lineage RBAC is Configured for Least Privilege
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in Data Catalog lineage RBAC minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches, thereby protecting
  sensitive information and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
  Over-permissioned access can lead to privilege escalation and data exfiltration,
  posing significant security and compliance risks.
description: This rule checks that Data Catalog lineage RBAC settings are configured
  to grant only the necessary permissions required for users to perform their job
  functions. Verify that IAM policies associated with Data Catalog entries restrict
  access to the minimum privileges needed. Remediation involves reviewing and updating
  IAM roles and permissions to align with the principle of least privilege.
