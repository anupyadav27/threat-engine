resource: entry_group
requirement: Data Catalog Registry Metadata Encryption Enabled
scope: datacatalog.entry_group.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure Data Catalog Registry Metadata is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting metadata in Google Cloud Data Catalog safeguards sensitive information
  against unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead to compliance violations
  with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Failure to encrypt metadata at
  rest increases the risk of exposure of critical data assets and can result in financial
  penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that Google Cloud Data Catalog entry groups have encryption
  enabled for registry metadata at rest. Specifically, it checks if the Data Catalog
  entry group utilizes customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) or Google-managed keys
  to protect metadata. To ensure compliance, configure your Data Catalog entry groups
  to use CMEK by setting the appropriate encryption settings in the GCP Console or
  via the gcloud command-line tool. Regularly audit your configuration to maintain
  security posture.
