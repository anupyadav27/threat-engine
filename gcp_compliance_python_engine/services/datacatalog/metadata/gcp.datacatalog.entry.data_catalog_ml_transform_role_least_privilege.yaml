title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog ML Transform Role
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Data Catalog roles mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, which can lead to data loss,
  compliance violations, and reputational damage. Ensuring that ML Transform roles
  have only necessary permissions protects sensitive data and aligns with regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that the ML Transform role in Data Catalog is configured
  with the minimum permissions necessary for its operation. Verify that the role does
  not have excess permissions by reviewing IAM policies attached to it. Remediation
  involves adjusting IAM policies to ensure only required permissions are granted,
  removing any superfluous access that does not align with explicit job functions.
