title: Enforce Least Privilege on Data Catalog Access Policies
rationale: Implementing least privilege on Data Catalog table access ensures that
  users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Failure to apply this principle
  can lead to excessive permissions, increasing the attack surface and potentially
  violating compliance frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST SP 800-53.
description: This rule verifies that access policies on Data Catalog entries are configured
  following the principle of least privilege. It checks for overly permissive roles
  or any misconfigurations that grant unnecessary access. To remediate, audit permissions
  regularly and use predefined roles that align with job functions. Remove any roles
  that exceed the necessary permissions and implement strict access reviews.
