title: Enable ML Transform Logs in Data Catalog
rationale: Enabling logging for ML transforms in Data Catalog is vital for tracking
  access and changes to machine learning-related metadata, which can help prevent
  unauthorized access and modifications. It assists in forensic analysis and compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate detailed logging of data
  access and transformations.
description: This rule checks if logging is enabled for ML transforms within Google
  Cloud's Data Catalog service. To verify, ensure that audit logs for ML transformations
  are active by configuring the appropriate log sinks and filters in the Cloud Logging
  service. Remediation involves setting up or correcting log configuration to capture
  ML transformation activities, thereby ensuring that all relevant access and changes
  are recorded.
