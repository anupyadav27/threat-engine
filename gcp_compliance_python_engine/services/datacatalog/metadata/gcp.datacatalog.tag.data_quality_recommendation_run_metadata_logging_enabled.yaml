title: Enable Metadata Logging for Data Quality Recommendations
rationale: Enabling metadata logging for data quality recommendations in Google Cloud
  Data Catalog ensures that all actions related to data quality are tracked and auditable.
  This is crucial for identifying data quality issues promptly, preventing data misuse,
  and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. Failure
  to log metadata can lead to undetected data anomalies, impacting data integrity
  and potentially resulting in financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether metadata logging is enabled for data quality
  recommendation runs in GCP Data Catalog. To verify, ensure that audit logs are configured
  to capture all data quality recommendation events. This involves setting up a logging
  sink to export audit logs to a centralized logging solution. Remediation involves
  navigating to the Data Catalog in GCP Console, enabling audit logging, and configuring
  log sinks to capture necessary metadata.
