rule_id: gcp.datacatalog.entry.datalake_export_destination_encrypted
service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Datalake Export Destination Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.entry.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Datalake Export Destinations are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting datalake export destinations mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Unencrypted data can be exploited by attackers, leading
  to potential financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA which mandate encryption of sensitive data at rest.
description: This rule checks whether the export destination of datalake entries in
  Google Cloud Data Catalog is encrypted. Verify that the destination uses Google-managed
  or customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to protect data at rest. Remediate by
  configuring the export destination bucket with CMEK through the Google Cloud Console
  or gcloud CLI, ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations.
