title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Catalog Tag Templates
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Data Catalog tag templates minimizes potential
  unauthorized access and data exposure risks. This is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and confidentiality, especially in regulated environments where compliance
  with standards like HIPAA or PCI-DSS is required. Misconfigured permissions could
  lead to data breaches or compliance violations, impacting both financial and reputational
  aspects of the business.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles granted on Data Catalog tag templates
  adhere to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that only necessary permissions
  are delegated, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Verify that roles assigned
  have the minimal set of permissions needed for their function by auditing IAM policies
  associated with tag templates. To remediate, adjust the roles to limit permissions
  to only those that are essential for the task, and regularly review IAM policy assignments.
