title: Ensure TLS for Data Catalog Entry Lineage
rationale: TLS encryption is critical for protecting data in transit, ensuring that
  lineage information in Data Catalog entries is not exposed to unauthorized access.
  Without TLS, data could be intercepted, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance
  with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether TLS is enforced for network connections when
  accessing lineage data within Data Catalog entries. To verify, inspect the network
  settings of your Data Catalog service to ensure TLS/SSL is configured and enforced.
  Remediation involves configuring the Data Catalog to only accept TLS connections,
  which can typically be done through the Google Cloud Console by setting the appropriate
  security policies.
