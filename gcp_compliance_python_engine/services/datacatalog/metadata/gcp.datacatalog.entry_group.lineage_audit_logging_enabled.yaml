title: Enable Lineage Audit Logging for Data Catalog Entry Groups
rationale: Enabling Lineage Audit Logging for Data Catalog Entry Groups helps track
  data access and modifications, which is crucial for identifying unauthorized activities
  and maintaining data integrity. It supports compliance with regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA by providing audit trails necessary for data governance and incident
  response. Without this logging, organizations may face increased risks of data breaches
  and non-compliance fines.
description: This rule checks whether Lineage Audit Logging is enabled for entry groups
  within Google Cloud's Data Catalog service. To ensure compliance, configure audit
  logging by navigating to the Google Cloud Console, selecting Data Catalog, and verifying
  that the 'Audit Logs' settings include both 'Admin Read' and 'Data Access'. If not
  enabled, update the IAM policies to support logging. Proper configuration ensures
  that all access and changes to data entries are logged for monitoring and forensic
  purposes.
