service: datacatalog
resource: tag
requirement: Datalake Data Quality Output Location Private And Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.tag.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Datalake Outputs are Private & Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Securing datalake outputs with encryption at rest and private access mitigates
  risks of unauthorized data exposure and data breaches. This practice ensures that
  sensitive data is protected against internal and external threats, aligns with compliance
  mandates like GDPR and HIPAA, and maintains customer trust by safeguarding personal
  information.
description: This rule checks that all data quality outputs from datalakes in Data
  Catalog are stored in locations that enforce encryption at rest and are not publicly
  accessible. Verify that the storage buckets used have uniform access configured
  to private and utilize Cloud KMS for encryption. If a bucket is public or lacks
  encryption, update its IAM policy to restrict access and apply a valid KMS key for
  data encryption.
