title: Ensure Trusted Sources for Lineage Classifier in Data Catalog
rationale: Using untrusted sources for lineage classification can lead to inaccurate
  data governance, impacting decision-making and increasing the risk of data breaches.
  Trustworthy sources are essential to maintain data integrity and comply with regulations
  such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent data protection and privacy controls.
description: This rule verifies that all sources used for lineage classification in
  Google Cloud's Data Catalog are from trusted origins. It checks the configuration
  of tag templates to ensure that only approved and verified sources are used. To
  remediate, review the list of sources configured in the tag template and update
  them to include only those that are verified and compliant with your organization's
  data governance policies.
