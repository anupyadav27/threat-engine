title: Ensure Data Catalog Crawler Operates in Private Networks
rationale: Restricting Data Catalog crawlers to private networks minimizes exposure
  to unauthorized internet access, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA. This control helps prevent
  unauthorized data scraping and potential exfiltration, safeguarding sensitive data
  assets.
description: This rule verifies that Data Catalog crawlers operate solely within private
  networks, ensuring that data discovery processes do not interact with the public
  internet. To enforce this, configure Data Catalog entries to use private IP addresses
  and limit access through VPC Service Controls. Remediation involves adjusting network
  configurations to ensure private connectivity and reviewing IAM policies to enforce
  network restrictions.
