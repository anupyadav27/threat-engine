requirement: Lineage Crawler Role Least Privilege

domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Lineage Crawler Role
rationale: Limiting the privileges of the Lineage Crawler Role minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Excessive permissions can lead
  to exposure of sensitive information and non-compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby increasing the organization's liability and risk
  profile.
description: This rule verifies that the Lineage Crawler Role is assigned only the
  necessary permissions to perform its function within the Data Catalog service. The
  role should not have permissions beyond what is required for data lineage tracking.
  To assess compliance, review the IAM policy bindings for the role and ensure it
  does not include permissions unrelated to lineage crawling. Remediation involves
  adjusting the IAM policy to remove unnecessary permissions, aligning with the principle
  of least privilege.
