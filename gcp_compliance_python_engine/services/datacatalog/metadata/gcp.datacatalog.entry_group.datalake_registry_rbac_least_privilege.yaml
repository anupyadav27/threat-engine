title: Ensure Least Privilege for Datalake Registry Entry Group
rationale: Implementing least privilege in RBAC for Data Catalog entry groups helps
  minimize potential data breaches by restricting access to necessary personnel only.
  This reduces the attack surface and aids in compliance with regulations like GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate controlled access to sensitive data. It also mitigates
  insider threats and limits the damage from compromised accounts.
description: This rule verifies that RBAC policies for Data Catalog entry groups are
  configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks that only roles
  necessary for specific tasks are granted to users, groups, or service accounts.
  To remediate, review IAM policies for entry groups and remove excessive permissions,
  ensuring that each role aligns with its required data access. Use GCP IAM policy
  analysis tools to audit permissions effectively.
