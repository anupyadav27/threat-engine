title: Restrict Datalake Crawler Scope to Allowlist in Data Catalog
rationale: Restricting the scope of datalake crawlers to a defined allowlist minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure and ensures that only approved data sets
  are processed. This is critical for maintaining data privacy, meeting compliance
  obligations such as GDPR, and preventing data breaches by limiting access to sensitive
  information.
description: This check ensures that the Datalake Crawler in Google Cloud Data Catalog
  is configured to only access resources specified in an allowlist. Verify that the
  crawler's configuration includes an allowlist of approved data sources and no wildcards
  or unrestricted patterns. Remediation involves reviewing the crawler's current access
  scope, identifying necessary resources, and updating the configuration to restrict
  access accordingly.
