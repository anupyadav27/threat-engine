requirement: Data Quality Ruleset Encrypted At Rest
scope: datacatalog.tag_template.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Quality Ruleset is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This aligns with compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personal and
  sensitive data. Failure to encrypt data at rest can expose the organization to legal
  liabilities and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether all Data Quality Rulesets within Google Cloud's
  Data Catalog are encrypted at rest using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys. To verify, ensure that encryption settings are configured in the tag template
  properties of the Data Catalog. Remediation involves applying appropriate encryption
  policies, such as enabling Google Cloud KMS to manage encryption keys, to secure
  data at rest.
