title: Ensure Lineage Ruleset Version is Pinned in Data Catalog
rationale: Pinning the lineage ruleset version in Google Cloud Data Catalog ensures
  that the data classification and lineage tracking use a consistent version of rulesets.
  This prevents unexpected changes that could impact data security and compliance,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized data alterations and ensuring adherence to data
  governance policies.
description: This rule checks if the lineage ruleset version in the Data Catalog tag
  template is pinned. A pinned version ensures that lineage tracking and data classification
  remain consistent and predictable. To verify, review the Data Catalog tag templates
  for lineage ruleset configurations and ensure a specific version is set. If not
  pinned, update the tag template configuration to specify a version number for the
  lineage ruleset, ensuring stability and compliance with data governance practices.
