title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Data Quality Role
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege in GCP's Data Catalog service
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It reduces
  the attack surface by limiting permissions to only those necessary for users to
  perform their roles. This practice aligns with compliance standards like ISO 27001
  and NIST SP 800-53, which emphasize minimizing access to sensitive data to prevent
  insider threats and accidental data exposures.
description: This rule checks if roles assigned for managing Data Catalog tags adhere
  to the principle of least privilege. It verifies that only users or service accounts
  with a justified business need have access to create, update, or delete tags. To
  remediate, audit all current role assignments to ensure they are scoped to the minimum
  necessary permissions. Use predefined roles where possible, and regularly review
  and update access controls to reflect changes in job responsibilities.
