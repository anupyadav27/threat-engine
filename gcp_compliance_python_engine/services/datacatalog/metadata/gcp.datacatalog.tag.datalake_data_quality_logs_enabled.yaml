title: Enable Data Quality Logs for Datalake in Data Catalog
rationale: Enabling data quality logging in a datalake environment helps identify
  inconsistencies, errors, and non-compliance with data standards, reducing the risk
  of poor data quality impacting business intelligence and decision-making processes.
  Additionally, it aids in compliance with data governance policies by providing an
  audit trail of data quality checks.
description: This rule checks whether data quality logging is enabled for datalake
  tags in Google Cloud Data Catalog. To verify, ensure that the Data Catalog service
  is configured to log data quality metrics for all tags associated with datalake
  resources. Remediation involves accessing the Data Catalog settings in the GCP Console
  and enabling logging for data quality metrics under the specific tags used by the
  datalake. This enhances visibility into data integrity and supports data governance
  and compliance efforts.
