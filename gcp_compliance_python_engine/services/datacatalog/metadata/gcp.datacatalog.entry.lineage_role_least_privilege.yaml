service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Lineage Role Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Data Catalog Lineage Role Follows Least Privilege
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to Data Catalog lineage roles
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Over-permissioned
  roles can lead to inadvertent data exposure and non-compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent access controls to protect sensitive
  data.
description: This rule checks that the roles assigned to users or service accounts
  for Data Catalog entries are limited to the minimum necessary permissions. Verify
  that roles such as 'roles/datacatalog.viewer' or custom roles with specific permissions
  are used instead of broad roles like 'owner' or 'editor'. To remediate, audit current
  role assignments and adjust them to ensure they grant only required permissions,
  using IAM policies and Google Cloud Console.
