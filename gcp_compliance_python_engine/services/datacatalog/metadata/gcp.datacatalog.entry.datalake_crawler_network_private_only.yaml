subcategory: network_access_control
severity: medium
title: Ensure Datalake Crawler Uses Private Network Only
rationale: Using private networks for Datalake Crawlers minimizes exposure to potential
  threats by restricting access to authorized internal networks only. This reduces
  the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, which is critical for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Compliance with regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA often requires ensuring data processing activities are secure
  and access is limited to trusted environments.
description: This rule checks that Datalake Crawlers within Google Cloud's Data Catalog
  are configured to operate solely on private networks. It involves verifying that
  network interfaces are not exposed to the public internet and ensuring that private
  IPs are used. Remediation involves updating network configurations to restrict Datalake
  Crawler access to internal IP addresses only, potentially using VPCs or other network
  segmentation methods.
