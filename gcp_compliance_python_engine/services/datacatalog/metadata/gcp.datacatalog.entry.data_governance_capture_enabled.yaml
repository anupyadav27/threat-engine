title: Ensure Data Governance Capture is Enabled for Data Catalog Entries
rationale: Enabling Data Governance Capture in GCP Data Catalog entries ensures that
  sensitive data is adequately monitored and protected through lifecycle management.
  This is crucial for mitigating risks such as unauthorized access and data breaches,
  while also fulfilling compliance requirements for data privacy regulations like
  GDPR and CCPA.
description: This check verifies that Data Governance Capture is activated for entries
  within the GCP Data Catalog. This setting helps in maintaining audit trails and
  managing data access policies effectively. To verify, ensure the Data Catalog service
  is configured to log access and changes to entries. Remediation involves enabling
  logging and governance features in the Data Catalog settings to track data usage
  and modifications comprehensively.
