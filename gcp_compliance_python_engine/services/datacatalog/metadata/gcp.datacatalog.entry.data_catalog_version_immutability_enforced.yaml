title: Ensure Immutability of Data Catalog Entry Versions
rationale: Enforcing immutability on Data Catalog entries ensures that once data is
  cataloged, it cannot be altered, mitigating risks of data tampering and unauthorized
  changes. This enhances the integrity and reliability of metadata, which is crucial
  for compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and supports audit trails for
  forensic analysis.
description: This rule checks if Data Catalog entries have version immutability enforced,
  ensuring that once a version is created, it cannot be modified or deleted. To verify,
  review the Data Catalog settings within the GCP Console to confirm that immutability
  policies are configured. Remediation involves setting up a policy that enforces
  version immutability, which can be done through the IAM policy bindings or using
  gcloud CLI commands to lock entry versions.
