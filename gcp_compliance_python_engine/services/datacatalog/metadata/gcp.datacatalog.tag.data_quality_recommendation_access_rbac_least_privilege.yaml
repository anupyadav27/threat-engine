title: Enforce Least Privilege for DataCatalog Tag Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for Data Catalog tags minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice is crucial
  in preventing exposure of sensitive metadata and ensuring compliance with regulatory
  frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA. Unauthorized access to data quality recommendations
  can lead to data integrity issues and undermine trust in data-driven decisions.
description: This rule checks if access to Data Catalog tags related to data quality
  recommendations is granted based on the principle of least privilege. Specifically,
  it verifies that only users or service accounts with a legitimate need have the
  necessary roles assigned. To remediate, review IAM policies and adjust roles to
  ensure minimal access is granted. Use the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI to
  audit and modify roles associated with Data Catalog, focusing on removing excessive
  permissions.
