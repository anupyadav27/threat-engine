title: Ensure Datalake Catalog Audit Logging is Enabled
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Datalake Catalog entries is crucial for maintaining
  visibility over data access and modifications. This helps identify unauthorized
  access, mitigate data exfiltration risks, and supports compliance with regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. By monitoring access and changes, organizations
  can quickly respond to potential security incidents and ensure data integrity.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for all entries in the
  Datalake Catalog within Google Cloud's Data Catalog service. Audit logs should be
  configured to capture 'ADMIN_READ', 'DATA_READ', and 'DATA_WRITE' activities to
  provide comprehensive visibility. To enable logging, configure the appropriate IAM
  roles and permissions, and ensure that Cloud Audit Logs are set up in the Google
  Cloud Console under 'IAM & Admin' -> 'Audit Logs'. Regularly review the logs to
  ensure compliance and address any anomalies.
