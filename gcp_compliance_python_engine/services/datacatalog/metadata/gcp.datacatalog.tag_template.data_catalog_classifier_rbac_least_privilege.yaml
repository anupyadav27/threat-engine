title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Tag Templates
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for Data Catalog Tag Templates minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It helps protect sensitive metadata
  by ensuring only necessary permissions are granted, reducing the attack surface
  and aiding compliance with standards like ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS, which mandate strict
  access controls.
description: This rule checks that permissions on Data Catalog Tag Templates are configured
  to follow the principle of least privilege. Verify that roles assigned to users
  or service accounts have only the minimum necessary permissions. Regularly review
  IAM policies to ensure they do not grant excessive access. To remediate, audit current
  role bindings and adjust IAM policies to align with least privilege principles,
  removing unnecessary permissions.
