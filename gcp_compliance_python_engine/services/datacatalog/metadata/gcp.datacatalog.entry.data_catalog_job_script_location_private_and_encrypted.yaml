service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Job Script Location Private And Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.entry.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Job Script Locations Are Secure and Encrypted
rationale: Securing and encrypting job script locations in Google Cloud's Data Catalog
  ensures that sensitive data scripts are protected from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity,
  especially when handling regulated data, and helps organizations comply with data
  protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks that all job script locations in GCP's Data Catalog
  are set to be private and encrypted. Scripts should be stored in Cloud Storage buckets
  configured with Bucket Policy Only, ensuring that only authorized users can access
  them. Encryption at rest should be enabled using Google-managed or customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK). Verification involves reviewing bucket IAM policies and
  encryption settings. Remediation includes updating bucket policies to restrict access
  and enabling CMEK as needed.
