title: Ensure Data Catalog Lineage is Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting lineage data at rest protects sensitive metadata from unauthorized
  access and potential breaches. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and
  confidentiality, especially in regulated industries such as healthcare and finance
  where compliance with standards like HIPAA and GDPR is required. Failure to encrypt
  data can lead to data exposure, violating compliance requirements and resulting
  in significant legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks that all Data Catalog entry lineage information is encrypted
  at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). To verify, ensure that the
  Data Catalog service is configured to use CMEK by setting the appropriate encryption
  key on the resources handling sensitive lineage data. Remediation involves updating
  the Data Catalog configuration to select a suitable CMEK for encrypting the data
  at rest, thus enhancing the security posture and meeting compliance mandates.
