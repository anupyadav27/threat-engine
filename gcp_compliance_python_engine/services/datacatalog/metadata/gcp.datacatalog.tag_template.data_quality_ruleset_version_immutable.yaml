title: Ensure Data Quality Ruleset Version is Immutable
rationale: Immutability of data quality ruleset versions prevents unauthorized changes
  that could compromise data integrity and privacy. It ensures that once a ruleset
  is applied, it remains consistent, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious
  alterations. This integrity is crucial for maintaining trust with stakeholders and
  complying with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that the data quality ruleset version within Google
  Cloud Data Catalog tag templates is immutable. To verify, ensure that once a ruleset
  version is created, it cannot be edited or deleted. Remediation involves configuring
  the tag template settings to lock the ruleset version upon creation. This can be
  done through the GCP Console or using the gcloud CLI, ensuring only authorized personnel
  can manage these settings.
