requirement: Datalake Catalog RBAC Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Datalake Catalog Entry RBAC Follows Least Privilege
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Datalake Catalog entries
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access, reducing potential data breaches
  and maintaining compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Overly permissive
  roles can lead to inadvertent exposure of sensitive data, impacting business reputation
  and incurring regulatory fines.
description: This rule checks that access permissions for Datalake Catalog entries
  are granted based on the principle of least privilege. It ensures that roles assigned
  to users or service accounts are scoped appropriately, avoiding overly broad permissions.
  Verification requires auditing IAM policies associated with data catalog entries
  and adjusting them to limit access to what is strictly necessary. Remediation involves
  reviewing and modifying IAM policies to remove excessive permissions and ensure
  only necessary roles are granted.
