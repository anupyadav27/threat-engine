title: Restrict Data Catalog Crawler Scope to Allowlist
rationale: Limiting the Data Catalog Crawler's scope to a predefined allowlist helps
  prevent unauthorized access and data leaks by ensuring that only specified data
  sources are indexed and managed. This controls access, minimizes exposure to sensitive
  information, and supports compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that the Data Catalog Crawler's scope is restricted
  to an allowlist of approved data sources. To ensure compliance, regularly review
  and update the allowlist to include only necessary and authorized data sets. Remediation
  involves configuring the Data Catalog settings to specify an allowlist, which can
  be managed through the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud command-line tool.
