requirement: Data Catalog Ruleset Encrypted At Rest
scope: datacatalog.tag_template.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Ruleset Encryption at Rest
rationale: Encrypting Data Catalog rulesets at rest protects sensitive metadata from
  unauthorized access and helps mitigate the risk of data breaches. This security
  measure is critical for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially
  in sectors subject to regulatory compliance such as finance, healthcare, and government.
  Failure to apply encryption could lead to significant financial penalties and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule verifies that Data Catalog tag templates are encrypted at rest
  using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. To confirm compliance,
  check that the Data Catalog API is configured to use encryption for tag templates.
  Remediation involves ensuring that all tag templates are stored in a project where
  encryption at rest is enforced, utilizing Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)
  if necessary.
