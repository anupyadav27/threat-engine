title: Ensure Data Quality Outputs are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting Data Quality Recommendation outputs in Google Cloud's Data Catalog
  ensures that sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. This mitigates the risk of data exposure and aligns with
  compliance requirements such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA. Proper encryption also
  helps in maintaining customer trust and safeguarding intellectual property.
description: This rule checks that outputs generated from Data Quality Recommendations
  in Google Cloud's Data Catalog are encrypted and kept private. It ensures that the
  data is secured using Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. To verify
  compliance, review the Data Catalog settings to confirm that encryption is enabled
  and configured correctly. Remediation involves setting up and applying the appropriate
  encryption keys to the Data Catalog outputs to ensure they are encrypted at rest.
