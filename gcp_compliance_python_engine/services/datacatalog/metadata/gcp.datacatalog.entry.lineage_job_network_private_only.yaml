title: Ensure Lineage Jobs Use Private Networks Only
rationale: Using private network connectivity for lineage jobs in Google Cloud Data
  Catalog minimizes exposure to public internet threats, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and unauthorized access. This practice supports compliance with data protection
  regulations like GDPR and enhances the security posture by limiting network access
  to authorized entities only.
description: This rule checks that lineage jobs within Data Catalog entries are configured
  to use private networks exclusively. To verify, ensure that the network settings
  for lineage jobs are set to private IPs, avoiding public IP exposure. Remediation
  involves updating the network configuration of these jobs to use VPC Service Controls
  or Private Google Access, thereby restricting access to internal networks only.
