service: datacatalog
resource: tag
requirement: Lineage Data Quality Output Location Private And Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.tag.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Lineage Data Quality Output is Private and Encrypted
rationale: Storing lineage data quality outputs insecurely can expose sensitive information,
  leading to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
  Encrypting this data at rest and ensuring its storage location is private mitigates
  risks of unauthorized access and data leakage, protecting organizational and customer
  data integrity.
description: This rule checks that the storage location for lineage data quality outputs
  in Google Cloud's Data Catalog is both private and encrypted. It ensures that Cloud
  Storage buckets used for this purpose have appropriate IAM policies restricting
  public access and that bucket-level encryption is enabled. Verification involves
  reviewing bucket settings in the Cloud Console or using command-line tools. Remediation
  steps include configuring IAM policies to restrict access and enabling encryption
  either by using Google-managed keys or customer-managed keys.
