title: Enable Data Quality Recommendation Logs in Data Catalog
rationale: Enabling logs for Data Quality Recommendations in Data Catalog is crucial
  for ensuring auditability and traceability of data quality assessments. It aids
  in identifying potential misconfigurations or errors in data tagging processes,
  which can lead to inaccurate data insights. This practice supports compliance with
  data governance frameworks by providing evidence of data accuracy and integrity
  assessments.
description: This rule verifies if logging is enabled for data quality recommendation
  runs in Google Cloud's Data Catalog. To ensure this, users should configure the
  Data Catalog to log all recommendation activities by enabling the appropriate logging
  settings in Stackdriver (or Cloud Logging). This can be done by setting up an audit
  log that captures 'Admin Read' and 'Data Write' actions. Failure to do so may result
  in the inability to trace data quality recommendations and could hinder troubleshooting
  and compliance efforts.
