requirement: Data Catalog Dev Endpoint Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.entry.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Dev Endpoint Encryption in Data Catalog
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in the Data Catalog is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with standards
  such as NIST and ISO 27001. Unencrypted endpoints can lead to data breaches, resulting
  in financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
description: This rule checks if the development endpoints in GCP Data Catalog entries
  are encrypted at rest. Encryption is achieved using Cloud KMS keys to protect sensitive
  metadata. To verify, ensure that all entries in the Data Catalog have encryption
  configured using customer-managed keys. Remediation involves setting up Cloud KMS
  and configuring the Data Catalog to use these keys for encryption.
