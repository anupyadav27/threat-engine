resource: entry_group
requirement: Lineage Registry Cross Account Sharing Restricted
scope: datacatalog.entry_group.security
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Restrict Cross-Account Lineage Registry Sharing
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of lineage registries in GCP Data Catalog
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, which could lead
  to data leaks or breaches. It is crucial for maintaining data sovereignty and complying
  with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Unrestricted sharing could
  expose critical lineage information to external accounts, posing a significant security
  risk.
description: This rule checks if lineage registries within GCP Data Catalog entry
  groups are shared across accounts, which should be restricted to prevent unauthorized
  access. Verify that IAM policies for entry groups do not grant access to external
  accounts. Remediation involves reviewing and refining IAM policies to limit access
  to trusted internal accounts only, ensuring compliance with organizational data
  protection policies. Use the GCP Console or CLI to audit and manage access control
  settings.
