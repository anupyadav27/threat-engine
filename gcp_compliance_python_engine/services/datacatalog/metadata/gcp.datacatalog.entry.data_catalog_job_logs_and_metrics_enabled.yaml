subcategory: audit_logging
severity: low
title: Ensure Data Catalog Job Logs and Metrics are Enabled
rationale: Enabling logs and metrics for Data Catalog jobs is crucial for monitoring
  data access and modifications, which helps identify and mitigate potential data
  breaches. It supports incident response and forensic investigations by providing
  a trail of activities. Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance requirements
  like GDPR and CCPA by ensuring accountability and transparency in data operations.
description: This rule verifies that logging and metrics are enabled for Google Cloud
  Data Catalog entries, ensuring that all access and changes to data are tracked.
  To check this, confirm that audit logs are configured for Data Catalog within the
  Google Cloud Console under Logging > Logs Router. Remediation involves setting up
  appropriate sinks and enabling audit logging for 'DATA_READ', 'DATA_WRITE', and
  'ADMIN_READ' activities for better visibility and control.
