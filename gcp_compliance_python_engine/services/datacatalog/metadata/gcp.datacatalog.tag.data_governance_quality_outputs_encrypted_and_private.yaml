requirement: Data Governance Quality Outputs Encrypted And Private
scope: datacatalog.tag.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Data Catalog Tags Are Encrypted and Private
rationale: Encrypting data governance quality outputs ensures that sensitive data
  is protected against unauthorized access, mitigating the risk of data breaches.
  It supports compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  mandate the protection of personal and sensitive information. By maintaining data
  privacy and confidentiality, organizations reduce legal liabilities and preserve
  their reputation.
description: This rule checks that all data governance quality outputs in Google Cloud
  Data Catalog are encrypted at rest and are configured to be private. Ensure that
  the tagging system in Data Catalog is set up to use customer-managed encryption
  keys (CMEK) for robust security control. Verification involves reviewing the Data
  Catalog settings in the GCP Console under the 'Security' section or using the gcloud
  CLI to ensure encryption settings use CMEK. Remediation requires configuring the
  Data Catalog to use CMEK and setting access controls to restrict visibility to authorized
  users only.
