title: Enable Data Governance Change Audit Logging for Entry Groups
rationale: Enabling audit logging for data governance changes in Google Cloud's Data
  Catalog helps track the modification history of entry groups. This is crucial for
  identifying unauthorized changes, ensuring accountability, and meeting compliance
  requirements such as SOC2 and ISO 27001. Without audit logs, detecting potential
  security breaches or misconfigurations becomes challenging, increasing organizational
  risk.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for data governance
  changes in Data Catalog entry groups. Audit logs should capture 'admin read' and
  'admin write' operations to ensure all modifications are tracked. Verify this setting
  by reviewing the audit log configuration in the Cloud Console under the Logging
  section or using the gcloud command-line tool. To enable, configure the appropriate
  logging settings in the IAM & Admin section, specifying the 'dataAccess' log type
  for entry group resources.
