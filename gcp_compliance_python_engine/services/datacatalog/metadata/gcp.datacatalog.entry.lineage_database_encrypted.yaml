requirement: Lineage Database Encrypted
scope: datacatalog.entry.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Encryption of Lineage Database in Data Catalog
rationale: Encrypting the lineage database in GCP Data Catalog is crucial to protect
  sensitive metadata from unauthorized access and to comply with data protection regulations.
  Unencrypted metadata can expose critical lineage information, risking data leaks
  and non-compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA. Encrypting data at rest mitigates
  these risks and ensures that sensitive information is protected even if the storage
  is compromised.
description: This rule checks if the lineage database associated with GCP Data Catalog
  entries is encrypted at rest. Ensure that encryption is enabled to protect metadata
  integrity and confidentiality. Verification involves checking the encryption configuration
  settings in your Data Catalog setup. To remediate, configure the Data Catalog to
  use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) or Google-managed encryption for all
  stored metadata.
