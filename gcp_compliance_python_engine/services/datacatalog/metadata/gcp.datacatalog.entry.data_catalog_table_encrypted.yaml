title: Ensure Data Catalog Table Entries are Encrypted at Rest
rationale: Encrypting Data Catalog table entries at rest is crucial to protect sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This measure reduces
  the risk of data exposure in case of a security incident and helps organizations
  comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate the protection
  of personal data. Encryption at rest also safeguards intellectual property and maintains
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether Data Catalog table entries are encrypted at
  rest using Google-managed encryption keys or customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).
  To verify, examine the encryption settings of your entries in the Google Cloud Console
  under the Data Catalog service. If entries are not encrypted, enable encryption
  by configuring CMEK or relying on default Google-managed encryption. Remediation
  involves updating the Data Catalog configuration to ensure all entries are encrypted
  at rest.
