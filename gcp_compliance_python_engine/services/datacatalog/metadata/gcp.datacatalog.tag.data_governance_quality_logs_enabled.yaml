title: Enable Data Catalog Tag Governance Logging
rationale: Enabling data governance quality logs in Google Cloud Data Catalog helps
  organizations maintain visibility over tag management and usage. This is crucial
  for ensuring data integrity, preventing unauthorized access, and meeting compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. Without proper logging, misconfigurations or
  unauthorized changes could go unnoticed, leading to potential data breaches or loss
  of compliance.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for Data Catalog tags to
  monitor the governance quality of data. To verify, ensure that audit logging is
  configured for Data Catalog in the Google Cloud Console under the 'IAM & Admin'
  section, then 'Audit Logs'. Remediation involves enabling Data Catalog audit logs
  by selecting the appropriate log type (Admin Activity, Data Access, etc.) and specifying
  the necessary log sinks for long-term storage and analysis.
