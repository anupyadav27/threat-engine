title: Ensure Lineage Crawlers Use Private Networks Only
rationale: Restricting Data Catalog lineage crawlers to private networks minimizes
  exposure to unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration. This practice is
  crucial for protecting sensitive metadata from being accessed by malicious actors
  over the internet. Compliance with network security standards like PCI-DSS and SOC2
  requires strict access controls to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks if Data Catalog lineage crawlers operate solely within
  private networks, ensuring they do not have public internet access. Verify that
  the network configuration for lineage crawlers is set to use only private IP addresses.
  To remediate, configure the network settings in the GCP console to restrict the
  crawler's communication to VPCs and disable any public IP allocation.
