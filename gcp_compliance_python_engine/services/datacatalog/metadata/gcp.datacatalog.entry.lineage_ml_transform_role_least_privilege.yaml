title: Ensure Least Privilege for Lineage Ml Transform Role in Data Catalog
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for the Lineage ML Transform
  Role in GCP Data Catalog minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality,
  especially when handling sensitive information that could be exposed or altered
  by overly permissive permissions. Adhering to this principle also supports compliance
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and CCPA, reducing legal and financial risks.
description: This rule verifies that the Lineage ML Transform Role in GCP Data Catalog
  is configured with the minimum permissions necessary to perform its intended functions,
  ensuring it does not have excessive access rights. To verify, review the IAM policies
  associated with Data Catalog entries and ensure roles are appropriately scoped.
  If a role has more permissions than needed, modify the policy to restrict access.
  Use the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to audit and update IAM policies, ensuring they
  align with the principle of least privilege.
