service: datacatalog
resource: entry
requirement: Data Catalog Crawler Role Least Privilege
scope: datacatalog.entry.logging
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Data Catalog Crawler Role Enforces Least Privilege
rationale: Enforcing least privilege for Data Catalog crawler roles minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. Misconfigured roles can lead to privilege
  escalation, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory standards such as
  GDPR and HIPAA. By limiting permissions, organizations can reduce their attack surface
  and improve their security posture.
description: This rule checks that the Data Catalog crawler role is configured to
  follow the principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions.
  Verify that roles assigned to crawlers do not exceed the minimum required permissions
  for their tasks. To remediate, audit the IAM policies associated with the Data Catalog
  and adjust permissions accordingly, ensuring compliance with least privilege principles.
