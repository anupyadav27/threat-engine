title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Entry Access
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for Data Catalog entries minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure and helps prevent potential data breaches.
  This is crucial for protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. A least privilege model
  limits access to only what is necessary for users to perform their job functions,
  reducing the attack surface and potential for insider threats.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles and permissions granted to users for
  Data Catalog entries adhere to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that
  users have access only to the necessary resources and operations required for their
  role. To verify compliance, review IAM policies on Data Catalog entries and remove
  any excessive permissions. Remediation may involve adjusting IAM roles, customizing
  policies, or using predefined roles that align with job responsibilities.
