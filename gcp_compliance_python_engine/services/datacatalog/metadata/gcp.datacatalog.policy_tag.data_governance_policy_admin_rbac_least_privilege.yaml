title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Governance Policy Admin in Data Catalog
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Data Governance Policy Admin roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, safeguarding sensitive
  data. This is crucial to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA,
  which mandate strict access controls to protect personal data and mitigate security
  threats.
description: This rule checks whether users assigned the 'Data Governance Policy Admin'
  role in Data Catalog have permissions strictly necessary for their duties. It verifies
  that no excessive permissions are granted that could lead to privilege escalation
  or data exposure. Remediation involves reviewing existing role assignments, removing
  unnecessary permissions, and ensuring roles align with the principle of least privilege.
  This can be done via the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI by inspecting IAM policies
  and revising them accordingly.
