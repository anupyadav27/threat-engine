title: Ensure Data Catalog Trigger Targets Use Least Privilege
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to Data Catalog triggers minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This approach is crucial
  for protecting sensitive information and avoiding compliance violations with standards
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls to maintain data
  integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks if Data Catalog triggers have permissions exceeding
  their functional requirements. Specifically, it examines IAM roles assigned to triggers
  and ensures they only have the minimum necessary permissions. To verify, review
  IAM policies associated with Data Catalog entries and adjust roles to align with
  least privilege principles. Remediation involves auditing roles and permissions,
  and restricting access to essential operations only.
