title: Ensure Least Privilege for Datalake Classifier Tag Templates
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for the Datalake Classifier in Data
  Catalog helps minimize the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
  Excessive permissions can lead to accidental or intentional misuse of sensitive
  data, impacting business operations and violating compliance mandates such as GDPR
  and CCPA.
description: This rule checks that only necessary permissions are granted to users
  or groups for accessing tag templates associated with the Datalake Classifier in
  the Data Catalog. It verifies that permissions align with least privilege principles,
  specifically focusing on reducing over-privileged accounts. Remediation involves
  reviewing and adjusting IAM policies to ensure that only essential roles are assigned,
  utilizing predefined roles where possible instead of overly permissive custom roles.
