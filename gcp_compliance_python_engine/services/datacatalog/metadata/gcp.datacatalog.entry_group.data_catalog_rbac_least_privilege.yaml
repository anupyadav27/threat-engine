title: Enforce Least Privilege on Data Catalog Entry Groups
rationale: Implementing least privilege principles for Data Catalog Entry Groups reduces
  the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. This control helps
  prevent privilege escalation and limits the impact of compromised accounts, aligning
  with compliance mandates such as GDPR and CCPA which emphasize data protection and
  privacy.
description: This rule verifies that RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies for
  Data Catalog Entry Groups are configured to ensure users and service accounts have
  only the permissions necessary to perform their roles. It checks for overly permissive
  roles and provides guidance on assigning predefined roles with the minimum required
  permissions. To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies for Entry Groups, removing
  excessive permissions and applying least privilege principles.
