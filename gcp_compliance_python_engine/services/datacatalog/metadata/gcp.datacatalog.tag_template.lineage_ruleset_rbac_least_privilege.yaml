subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Catalog Tag Template Lineage
rationale: Implementing least privilege for lineage rulesets in GCP Data Catalog minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Misconfigured permissions can
  lead to data leaks, violating compliance requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, and
  may result in financial and reputational damage. Proper access control is critical
  for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule checks that access to Data Catalog tag templates with lineage
  rulesets is restricted to only those identities that require it. Verify that IAM
  roles assigned to users or service accounts have the least privileges necessary.
  Remediate by auditing current permissions, removing unnecessary roles, and using
  predefined roles over primitive roles whenever possible. Regularly review and adjust
  access rights to adapt to organizational changes.
