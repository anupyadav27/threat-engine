title: Enforce 90-Day Rotation for User-Managed IAM Keys
rationale: Frequent rotation of user-managed IAM keys mitigates the risk of compromised
  credentials being used for unauthorized access. Stale or long-lived keys can be
  exploited by attackers, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with
  security standards. Regular key rotation is essential for maintaining strong security
  posture and adhering to compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if user-managed IAM keys are rotated within 90 days.
  It requires configuring IAM policies to enforce key rotation schedules and monitoring
  key age. To verify, audit IAM key last used dates and ensure automated alerts for
  keys nearing expiration. Remediation involves setting up automated scripts or using
  GCP tools to rotate keys and update dependent services, ensuring all keys comply
  with the 90-day rotation policy.
