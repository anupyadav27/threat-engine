title: Detect and Resolve IAM Role Conflicts for Service Accounts
rationale: Role conflicts for service accounts can lead to unauthorized access or
  privilege escalation, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with
  regulations. Properly configured roles help to enforce least privilege principles
  and ensure that service accounts have only the necessary permissions to perform
  their tasks, reducing the attack surface.
description: This rule checks for role conflicts in GCP IAM service accounts where
  multiple roles may grant overlapping or excessive permissions. To verify, audit
  the roles assigned to service accounts and ensure no conflicting roles are configured.
  Remediation involves reviewing the roles and removing any redundant or excessive
  permissions, aligning them with the principle of least privilege.
