title: Rotate IAM Access Keys Every 90 Days
rationale: Regularly rotating access keys mitigates the risk of credential exposure
  and reduces the impact of a compromised key. Non-rotated keys are more susceptible
  to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches and non-compliance with
  security regulations such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks if IAM access keys have been rotated within the last
  90 days. Keys that have not been rotated may expose your resources to security vulnerabilities.
  To verify, review the 'last used' date of each key in the IAM console. Remediate
  by deleting old keys and creating new ones, updating any dependent systems to use
  the new keys to maintain operational continuity.
