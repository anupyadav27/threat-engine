title: Enforce Least Privilege for Service Account Access Scopes/Roles
rationale: Limiting access scopes and roles for service accounts is crucial to minimizing
  the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.
  Over-permissioned roles can lead to potential data breaches and non-compliance with
  regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. By adhering to least privilege principles, organizations
  can better protect their cloud environment and meet compliance requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all service accounts are assigned the minimal
  set of access scopes or roles necessary for their function. It checks for overly
  broad permissions that exceed operational requirements. To ensure least privilege,
  audit all service accounts and adjust their roles to the minimum required. Regularly
  review and update these permissions in accordance with any changes in service account
  usage or organizational policy.
