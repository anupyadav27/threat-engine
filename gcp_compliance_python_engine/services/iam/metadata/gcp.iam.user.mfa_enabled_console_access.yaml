title: Ensure MFA for Console Access of IAM Users
rationale: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly enhances security by requiring
  additional verification beyond just a password, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access. This is crucial for protecting sensitive resources and data from identity
  theft and account breaches, which can lead to financial loss, reputational damage,
  and non-compliance with standards like NIST SP 800-53 and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule verifies that all IAM users with console access have MFA enabled.
  To check compliance, review user security settings in the Google Cloud Console under
  IAM & Admin > Users, ensuring MFA is configured. Remediation involves enabling MFA
  through the 'Security' section of the user's profile, requiring additional steps
  for login verification. This ensures that only authenticated users can access the
  console, mitigating potential unauthorized access risks.
