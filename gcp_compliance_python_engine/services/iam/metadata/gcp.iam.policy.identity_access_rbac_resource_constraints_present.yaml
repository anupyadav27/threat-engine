title: Ensure RBAC Resource Constraints are Defined in IAM Policies
rationale: Defining RBAC resource constraints in IAM policies is crucial to minimize
  over-privileged access, reducing the risk of unauthorized data access and potential
  compliance violations. It helps maintain the principle of least privilege by ensuring
  that IAM roles are applied only to necessary resources, thereby mitigating internal
  and external threats.
description: This rule checks that Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in
  GCP have clearly defined RBAC resource constraints. Without these constraints, roles
  may have excessive access to resources, leading to potential security risks. To
  verify, review IAM policies for the presence of resource-level constraints. Remediation
  involves updating IAM policies to include specific resource constraints, ensuring
  roles are limited to only the necessary resources required for their function.
