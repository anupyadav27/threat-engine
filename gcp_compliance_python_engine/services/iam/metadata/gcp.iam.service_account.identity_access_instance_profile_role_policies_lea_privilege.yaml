domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: high
title: Restrict Service Account Role to Least Privilege
rationale: Allowing excessive permissions to service accounts can lead to unauthorized
  access and privilege escalation, posing significant security risks such as data
  breaches and compromised resources. Ensuring least privilege aligns with compliance
  requirements such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, reducing the attack surface and safeguarding
  sensitive operations.
description: This rule checks for service accounts assigned with IAM roles that exceed
  the necessary permissions required for their function. It verifies that no service
  account has over-privileged roles such as 'Owner' or 'Editor'. To remediate, review
  and adjust IAM policies to ensure each service account has only the permissions
  necessary for its specific tasks. This can be done through the GCP Console or gcloud
  CLI by auditing current role assignments and modifying them accordingly.
