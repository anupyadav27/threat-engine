title: Ensure IAM Policies Meet Compliance Standards
rationale: Adhering to IAM policy compliance is crucial for protecting sensitive data
  and maintaining operational integrity. Non-compliance can lead to unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and regulatory fines. Organizations must ensure their IAM policies
  reflect the least privilege principle and comply with industry standards to reduce
  security risks and meet regulatory obligations.
description: This rule checks if IAM policies are configured to comply with defined
  security standards and best practices. It involves verifying that policies enforce
  the least privilege, do not include overly permissive roles, and are regularly reviewed
  and updated. Remediation includes auditing IAM policies, removing unnecessary permissions,
  and utilizing predefined roles where possible. Automated tools or scripts can assist
  in continuous compliance monitoring.
