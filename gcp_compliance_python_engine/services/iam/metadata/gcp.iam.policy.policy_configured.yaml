title: Ensure IAM Policy is Correctly Configured
rationale: Proper configuration of IAM policies is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access to resources, reducing the risk of data breaches and supporting compliance
  with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Misconfigured policies can lead to privilege
  escalation and unauthorized data manipulation, impacting business operations and
  reputational standing.
description: This rule checks if IAM policies are correctly configured, ensuring that
  least privilege principles are applied and no overly permissive roles are assigned.
  Verify that all IAM policies are documented and reviewed regularly, with roles assigned
  only as needed. Remediation involves auditing current policies, removing unnecessary
  permissions, and utilizing custom roles where appropriate to minimize access.
