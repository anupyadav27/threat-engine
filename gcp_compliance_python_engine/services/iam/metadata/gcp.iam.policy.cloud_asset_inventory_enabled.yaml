title: Ensure Cloud Asset Inventory is Enabled for IAM Policies
rationale: Enabling Cloud Asset Inventory is crucial for maintaining visibility over
  your IAM policies and understanding resource access. Without it, organizations face
  risks such as unauthorized access and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR
  and CCPA. This can lead to data breaches, financial penalties, and loss of customer
  trust.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud Asset Inventory is enabled in your GCP
  environment, specifically for tracking IAM policies. Cloud Asset Inventory provides
  a detailed inventory of your cloud assets, which helps in monitoring and managing
  access controls effectively. To verify, navigate to the Cloud Console, ensure the
  Cloud Asset API is enabled, and check that asset history is being recorded. Remediate
  by enabling the API and configuring asset types to include IAM policies, ensuring
  a comprehensive view of your access policy landscape.
