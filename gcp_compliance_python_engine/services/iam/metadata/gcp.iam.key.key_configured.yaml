title: Ensure IAM Keys are Properly Configured
rationale: Improperly configured IAM keys can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and potential non-compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
  Ensuring that IAM keys are securely configured helps protect sensitive information
  and maintain system integrity, minimizing the risk of exploitation by malicious
  actors.
description: This rule checks that all IAM service account keys are configured with
  strong security settings, such as expiration dates and restricted permissions. Ensure
  keys are rotated regularly and audit logs are enabled to track usage. Remediation
  involves setting expiration dates, regularly reviewing key permissions, and removing
  unused keys to reduce the attack surface.
