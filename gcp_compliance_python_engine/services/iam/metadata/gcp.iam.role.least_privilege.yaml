severity: high
title: Ensure IAM Roles Follow Least Privilege Principle
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, which can lead to financial losses and compliance
  penalties. By restricting roles to only the permissions necessary for their tasks,
  organizations reduce the attack surface and protect sensitive data from malicious
  actors.
description: This rule checks if IAM roles in GCP are configured with permissions
  that adhere to the least privilege principle. Review roles to ensure they do not
  have more permissions than necessary for their intended purpose. Remediation involves
  auditing role permissions and adjusting them to align with specific job functions,
  ensuring they are not overly permissive. Verification can be conducted via the IAM
  section in the GCP Console or using gcloud CLI commands to list and review role
  permissions.
