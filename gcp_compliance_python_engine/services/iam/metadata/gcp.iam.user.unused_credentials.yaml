title: Identify and Disable Unused GCP IAM User Credentials
rationale: Unused IAM user credentials pose a significant security risk as they can
  be exploited by unauthorized users if compromised. These credentials increase the
  attack surface and can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential
  regulatory non-compliance. Regularly reviewing and disabling unused credentials
  helps mitigate these risks and ensures compliance with security best practices.
description: This rule checks for IAM user credentials that have not been used within
  a specified timeframe, indicating they may no longer be necessary. To enhance security,
  credentials that have been inactive for 90 days or more should be disabled or removed.
  Administrators can review the 'Last Used' information in the IAM console or via
  the gcloud CLI to identify such credentials. Remediation involves either confirming
  the necessity of the credentials or disabling them to prevent unauthorized access.
