title: Enforce IAM Policy Password Minimum Length of 14 Characters
rationale: Ensuring a minimum password length of 14 characters significantly enhances
  security by making it more difficult for attackers to use brute force or dictionary
  attacks to compromise user accounts. Longer passwords exponentially increase the
  number of possible combinations, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  Adhering to this requirement helps meet compliance standards such as NIST SP 800-63
  for password policies, which many organizations are obligated to follow.
description: This rule verifies that all IAM policies enforce a minimum password length
  of 14 characters. Administrators should configure Google Cloud IAM settings to set
  password policies that adhere to this length requirement. To verify, check the IAM
  settings under the Google Cloud Console or use gcloud CLI commands to list current
  policies. Remediation includes updating the policy settings to ensure the minimum
  length criteria is met, thus strengthening account security against unauthorized
  access.
