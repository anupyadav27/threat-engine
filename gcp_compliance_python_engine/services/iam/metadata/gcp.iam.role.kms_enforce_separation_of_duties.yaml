title: Ensure KMS Roles Enforce Separation of Duties
rationale: Implementing separation of duties in KMS roles mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches by distributing responsibilities among multiple individuals.
  This approach reduces the potential for insider threats and aligns with compliance
  requirements, such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, promoting secure key management practices.
description: This rule checks that roles associated with Google Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS) are configured to enforce separation of duties by ensuring that critical
  permissions are not concentrated within a single role. Verify that roles are defined
  to separate key creation, rotation, and usage tasks among different users or service
  accounts. To remediate, review IAM policies and adjust role assignments to comply
  with this principle, ensuring no single role has excessive permissions.
