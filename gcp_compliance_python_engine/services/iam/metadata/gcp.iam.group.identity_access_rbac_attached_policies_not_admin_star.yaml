service: iam
resource: group
requirement: Identity Access RBAC Attached Policies Not Admin Star
scope: iam.group.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Restrict Admin Role in Group IAM Policies
rationale: Assigning broad admin permissions to IAM groups can lead to unchecked access
  across the GCP environment, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and accidental
  or malicious misuse of resources. This poses significant security threats and could
  lead to non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require
  least privilege access controls.
description: This rule checks that IAM policies attached to groups do not include
  overly permissive roles, such as 'roles/*', which grant admin-level access. To verify,
  review IAM policies for groups and ensure no policies include wildcard roles. Remediation
  involves narrowing permissions by using predefined roles or custom roles that align
  with the principle of least privilege, thereby reducing risk exposure.
