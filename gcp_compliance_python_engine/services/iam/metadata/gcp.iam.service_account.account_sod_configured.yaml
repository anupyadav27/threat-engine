title: Enforce Separation of Duties for Service Accounts
rationale: Separation of duties (SoD) for service accounts mitigates the risk of privilege
  misuse by ensuring that no single service account has excessive permissions that
  could compromise security. Misconfigured service accounts can lead to unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Properly configured SoD aligns with compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties.
description: This rule checks whether service accounts are configured with separation
  of duties to minimize security risks. It verifies that no single service account
  has overly broad permissions that could allow unauthorized actions. To remediate,
  review permissions for each service account, and ensure roles such as 'editor' and
  'owner' are not assigned to service accounts unnecessarily. Implement least privilege
  by assigning only essential roles and monitor changes using audit logs.
