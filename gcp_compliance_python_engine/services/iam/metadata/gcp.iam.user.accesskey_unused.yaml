title: Identify and Disable Unused GCP IAM Access Keys
rationale: Unused IAM access keys pose a significant security risk as they can be
  exploited in unauthorized access attempts, leading to potential data breaches. Regularly
  auditing and disabling unused keys helps maintain a secure environment and ensures
  compliance with security frameworks such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require
  strict access controls.
description: This rule checks for IAM user access keys in GCP that have not been used
  within a specified period. Identifying these keys is crucial as they may indicate
  stale or abandoned accounts that could be targeted for exploitation. To mitigate
  risk, unused access keys should be disabled and rotated regularly. Administrators
  can use the GCP Console or gcloud CLI to review key usage and take appropriate action.
