title: Avoid Inline Policies for IAM Group Access Control
rationale: Using inline policies for IAM groups can lead to fragmented and hard-to-manage
  permissions, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. This practice can complicate
  audits and compliance efforts, as inline policies are less visible and harder to
  track compared to managed policies. Adhering to this rule helps maintain clear and
  consistent access control, reducing potential security breaches and ensuring compliance
  with frameworks such as ISO 27001 and NIST.
description: This rule checks that IAM groups do not use inline policies, which should
  be replaced with managed policies for better visibility and control. Inline policies
  are directly attached to a resource, complicating permission management and auditing.
  To verify, inspect IAM group policies and ensure they reference managed policies
  only. Remediation involves detaching inline policies and applying equivalent managed
  policies instead.
