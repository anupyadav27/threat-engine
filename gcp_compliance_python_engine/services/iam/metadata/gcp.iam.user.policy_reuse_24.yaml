title: Ensure Unique IAM Policies for User Accounts
rationale: Reusing IAM policies across multiple user accounts can lead to elevated
  security risks, including privilege escalation and unauthorized access. Distinct
  policies help maintain principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface
  and fulfilling compliance requirements such as NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001. Ensuring
  unique policies also aids in more effective auditing and incident response.
description: This rule checks for reused IAM policies among user accounts within GCP
  to ensure that each user has a unique set of permissions. Verify that IAM roles
  are not overly permissive and are tailored to the specific needs of each user. Remediation
  involves reviewing existing IAM policies, identifying shared policies, and creating
  customized roles to limit permissions according to job functions. Regular audits
  and updates to IAM policies help maintain compliance and security posture.
