title: Ensure IAM Audit Logs Are Enabled for All Services
rationale: Enabling audit logs for IAM services is crucial for tracking access and
  modifications to resources, which helps in identifying unauthorized actions or potential
  security breaches. This practice supports regulatory compliance by providing a detailed
  record of activities, aiding in forensic investigations and demonstrating adherence
  to security policies.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for Google Cloud IAM
  policies, ensuring that all read, write, and administrative activities are recorded.
  To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select Logging > Logs Configuration,
  and confirm that audit logs are active for all IAM services. If not enabled, configure
  audit logging by setting up appropriate log sinks and permissions. This ensures
  comprehensive monitoring and accountability of IAM-related actions.
