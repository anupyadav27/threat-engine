title: Identify and Mitigate Overly Permissive IAM Policies
rationale: Overly permissive IAM policies can lead to unauthorized access, resulting
  in potential data breaches and compliance violations. Such policies increase the
  risk of privilege escalation and data exfiltration, impacting the organization's
  security posture and regulatory requirements under frameworks like PCI-DSS and ISO
  27001.
description: This rule checks for IAM policies that grant excessive permissions, such
  as roles with wildcard ('*') permissions or broad access across resources. To verify,
  review IAM policy bindings and ensure roles are assigned on a principle of least
  privilege basis. Remediation involves auditing and refining IAM roles to limit permissions
  to only what is necessary for users to perform their job functions.
