title: Restrict Instance Profile Wildcard Permissions on Service Accounts
rationale: Allowing wildcard permissions on IAM instance profiles for service accounts
  can lead to excessive privilege escalation. This misconfiguration may allow services
  to perform unauthorized actions and access sensitive data, increasing the risk of
  data breaches and non-compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for service accounts that have IAM instance profiles
  with wildcard permissions ('*') that are overly permissive. To verify, review the
  IAM policies associated with each service account and ensure that specific permissions
  are granted rather than wildcards. Remediation involves refining IAM policies to
  grant only the necessary permissions required for the service account's intended
  tasks, following the principle of least privilege.
