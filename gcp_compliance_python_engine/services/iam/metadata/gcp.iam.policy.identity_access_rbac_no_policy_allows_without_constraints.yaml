title: Restrict IAM Policies Without Constraints
rationale: Allowing IAM policies without constraints can lead to excessive permissions,
  increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This can affect business
  continuity and result in non-compliance with standards like ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS,
  potentially leading to financial penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks for IAM policies that grant permissions without specifying
  constraints such as conditions. Such lax policies can inadvertently provide more
  access than intended. To remediate, review and update IAM policies to include necessary
  conditions, ensuring access is restricted to specific circumstances. Verification
  involves inspecting IAM policy bindings for the presence of conditions.
