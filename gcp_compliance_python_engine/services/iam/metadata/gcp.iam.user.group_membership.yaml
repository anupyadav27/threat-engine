requirement: Group Membership

subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Users are Assigned to Appropriate IAM Groups
rationale: User group memberships in IAM are crucial for maintaining least privilege
  access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Assigning
  users to the correct groups ensures that permissions are managed centrally and consistently,
  aligning with organizational security policies and regulatory compliance such as
  PCI-DSS and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks that all users in GCP are part of appropriate IAM groups,
  ensuring they have the correct access permissions. To verify, review the IAM settings
  and ensure that users are assigned to predefined groups that match their roles.
  Remediation involves assigning users to the appropriate group using the Google Cloud
  Console or gcloud CLI. This process helps streamline permission management and enforce
  security best practices.
