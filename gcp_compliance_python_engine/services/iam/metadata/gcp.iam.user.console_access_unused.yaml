title: Identify Unused IAM User Console Access
rationale: Unused console access for IAM users can represent a significant security
  risk, as inactive accounts may be more vulnerable to compromise. Attackers may exploit
  these neglected accounts to gain unauthorized access to your GCP environment, potentially
  leading to data breaches or resource misuse. Additionally, maintaining inactive
  users could lead to non-compliance with various security frameworks that require
  regular review and deactivation of unused accounts.
description: This rule checks for IAM users who have not accessed the Google Cloud
  Console for a specified period, indicating potentially unnecessary access permissions.
  Regularly reviewing and disabling unused console access helps minimize the attack
  surface by ensuring that only active users retain access. To verify, review the
  'last sign-in' details under IAM users in the GCP Console and disable or delete
  accounts that have been inactive beyond your organization's defined threshold. Remediation
  steps include configuring automated alerts for inactive accounts and establishing
  a process for periodic access reviews.
