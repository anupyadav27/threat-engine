title: Restrict External Sharing of IAM Group Access
rationale: Restricting external sharing of IAM group access is critical to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. External sharing without proper
  controls can lead to exposure of confidential information, non-compliance with data
  protection regulations, and increased risk of security breaches. Ensuring that only
  authorized identities have access minimizes the risk of insider threats and data
  leaks.
description: This rule checks whether IAM groups have restrictions in place to prevent
  unauthorized external sharing of access rights. It ensures that IAM group configurations
  do not allow identities outside the organization to gain unintended access. Verification
  involves reviewing IAM policies and group memberships for compliance with organizational
  policies. Remediation includes configuring IAM policies to limit access to trusted
  identities and regularly auditing group memberships to ensure compliance.
