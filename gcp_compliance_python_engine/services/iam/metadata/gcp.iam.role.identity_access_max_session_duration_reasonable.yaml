subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure IAM Role Session Duration is Configured Appropriately
rationale: Setting a reasonable session duration for IAM roles reduces the risk of
  credential misuse by limiting the time an identity can remain active without re-authentication.
  This helps mitigate potential unauthorized access in case of compromised sessions,
  aligning with compliance requirements such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53. Ensuring
  appropriate session durations enhances security by enforcing periodic re-authentication,
  which is critical for maintaining the integrity of sensitive operations.
description: This rule checks that the maximum session duration for IAM roles in GCP
  is set to a reasonable value. By default, roles can have a session duration of up
  to 12 hours, but it is recommended to configure this setting to a shorter period,
  such as 1 hour, to minimize security risks. To verify, inspect the IAM role settings
  in the Google Cloud Console or use the `gcloud` command-line tool to check the `maxSessionDuration`
  attribute. Remediation involves adjusting this configuration to a lower value, balancing
  operational needs with security best practices.
