title: Ensure MFA is Enabled for All IAM Users
rationale: Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for users enhances security
  by requiring an additional factor beyond just a password, thus protecting against
  unauthorized access. This is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining
  trust. Non-compliance can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and legal penalties
  under frameworks like PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks if MFA is enabled for all Google Cloud IAM users. To
  verify compliance, confirm that all user accounts have MFA configured using Cloud
  Identity. Remediation involves setting up and enforcing an MFA policy via the Google
  Admin console, ensuring that users register their devices and enable MFA. Regular
  audits should be performed to maintain compliance.
