title: Ensure IAM Keys Are Rotated Every 90 Days
rationale: Rotating IAM keys every 90 days minimizes the risk of key compromise. Stale
  or long-lived keys increase the attack surface, making it easier for malicious actors
  to exploit outdated credentials. Regular rotation of keys is a best practice that
  supports compliance with regulations such as NIST and ISO 27001, which mandate strict
  access control mechanisms.
description: This rule checks that IAM keys in your GCP environment are rotated at
  least every 90 days. To verify, review the 'last_used' and 'created' timestamps
  of IAM keys and ensure no key exceeds the 90-day threshold. If a key is older than
  90 days, it's recommended to create and distribute new keys, then revoke the old
  ones. Use the 'gcloud iam service-accounts keys list' command to audit key ages
  and manage rotations programmatically.
