title: Disable Long-Lived Keys for User-Managed Service Accounts
rationale: Long-lived keys associated with user-managed service accounts pose a significant
  security risk as they can be exposed or compromised, leading to unauthorized access.
  Ensuring that service accounts do not use long-lived keys enhances security by reducing
  the attack surface and aligning with compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001, which mandate strict access control and key management practices.
description: This rule checks for the presence of user-managed long-lived keys in
  service accounts, which should be avoided to minimize security risks. Instead, use
  short-lived keys or OAuth tokens for service account access, promoting the use of
  IAM roles for authentication. Remediation involves removing existing long-lived
  keys and transitioning to more secure authentication methods by following Google
  Cloud's best practices for service account key management.
