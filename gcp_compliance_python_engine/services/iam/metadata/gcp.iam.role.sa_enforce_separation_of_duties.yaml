title: Enforce Separation of Duties for Service Accounts
rationale: Implementing separation of duties for service accounts in GCP minimizes
  the risk of privilege misuse and unauthorized access. By ensuring that critical
  tasks are divided among different accounts, organizations can prevent a single point
  of failure and reduce insider threats. This practice supports compliance with regulatory
  standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, which require strict access control
  measures.
description: This rule checks that GCP service accounts are configured to enforce
  separation of duties by restricting permissions to necessary roles only. Ensure
  service accounts do not have excessive or overlapping privileges by regularly auditing
  and adjusting IAM roles. Remediation involves reviewing service account roles via
  the IAM console or CLI and removing any unnecessary permissions, aligning roles
  with the principle of least privilege.
