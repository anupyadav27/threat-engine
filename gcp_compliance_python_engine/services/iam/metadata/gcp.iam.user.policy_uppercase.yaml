title: Ensure IAM Policies Use Uppercase for User Identifiers
rationale: Using consistent uppercase identifiers for IAM policies enhances readability
  and reduces the risk of human error in policy management. It helps prevent unauthorized
  access due to misconfiguration and supports compliance with best practices for identity
  governance. Consistent formatting aids in maintaining a secure, manageable cloud
  environment.
description: This check ensures that user identifiers in IAM policies are in uppercase
  format. Verify policy configurations by reviewing IAM roles and bindings for case
  consistency. Remediate by updating policies to use uppercase identifiers, ensuring
  all IAM roles and user accounts comply with this standard. This practice prevents
  accidental privilege escalation and simplifies auditing processes.
