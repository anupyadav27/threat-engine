title: Ensure IAM Policies Enforce Strong Authentication
rationale: Implementing strong authentication mechanisms prevents unauthorized access
  to critical cloud resources, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with security regulations such as NIST and PCI-DSS. Without strong authentication,
  attackers could exploit weak credentials or identity vulnerabilities, leading to
  potential data loss and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks if IAM policies enforce strong authentication by requiring
  multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with access to sensitive resources.
  To verify, audit IAM policies to ensure MFA is enabled and enforced. Remediation
  involves configuring IAM roles and policies to mandate the use of MFA for high-privilege
  accounts, and regularly reviewing access logs for compliance.
