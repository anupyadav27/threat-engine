title: Ensure GCP IAM Users Belong to Appropriate Groups
rationale: Grouping IAM users within GCP allows for centralized management of access
  permissions, reducing the risk of excessive privileges and potential data breaches.
  This practice supports compliance with principle of least privilege and aligns with
  regulatory standards like PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, ensuring users have only the necessary
  access for their roles.
description: This rule checks if IAM users are assigned to appropriate groups within
  GCP, allowing for streamlined and secure management of permissions. Users not in
  groups may have unmanaged or over-privileged access. To verify, review IAM settings
  to ensure all users are correctly grouped, and align their permissions with organizational
  policies. Remediate by assigning users to relevant groups or creating groups that
  reflect access requirements.
