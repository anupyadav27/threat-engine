title: Enforce 90-Day Rotation for Service Account Keys
rationale: Regularly rotating service account keys helps mitigate the risk of key
  compromise, which could lead to unauthorized access to resources. This practice
  aligns with security best practices and compliance mandates such as PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001, reducing the window of opportunity for malicious actors exploiting stale
  keys.
description: This rule checks for service accounts in GCP that do not have enforced
  key rotation within 90 days. Service account keys should be rotated regularly to
  prevent unauthorized access due to key exposure. Verify key rotation policies in
  the IAM settings and update any service accounts to ensure keys are rotated every
  90 days. Remediation involves using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line
  tool to implement and manage key rotation policies.
