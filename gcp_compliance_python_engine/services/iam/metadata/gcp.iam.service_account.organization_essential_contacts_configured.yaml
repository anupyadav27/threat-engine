title: Ensure Org Essential Contacts for IAM Service Accounts
rationale: Configuring Organization Essential Contacts for IAM Service Accounts helps
  ensure that critical notifications, such as security alerts or compliance issues,
  reach the right stakeholders promptly. This reduces the risk of missed alerts that
  could lead to data breaches or non-compliance with regulatory frameworks, potentially
  resulting in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether essential contacts are configured at the organization
  level for IAM service accounts. Essential contacts receive important notifications
  about security, privacy, and compliance issues. To verify, ensure that your organization
  has defined at least one essential contact via the Google Cloud Console under the
  Essential Contacts section. Remediation involves adding appropriate contacts to
  receive relevant alerts, ensuring they are kept up to date.
