title: Avoid Inline Policies in IAM Roles
rationale: Inline policies attached directly to IAM roles can lead to complex policy
  management and potential security risks, as they may not be centrally managed or
  easily reviewed. This poses a risk of unintended privilege escalation or unauthorized
  access, impacting compliance with security standards such as NIST and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks for inline policies directly attached to IAM roles in
  GCP. Inline policies should be avoided in favor of using managed policies, which
  offer better control and auditing capabilities. To verify, inspect IAM roles for
  any inline policies and migrate them to managed policies. This enhances security
  posture by simplifying policy management and ensuring consistent access controls.
