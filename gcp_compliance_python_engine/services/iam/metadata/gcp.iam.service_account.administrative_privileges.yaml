subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Restrict Admin Privileges for Service Accounts
rationale: Service accounts with administrative privileges pose a significant security
  risk as they can be exploited by attackers to access sensitive resources and perform
  unauthorized actions. Limiting these privileges reduces the attack surface and helps
  prevent potential data breaches and compliance violations under frameworks like
  NIST and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks for service accounts that have been granted excessive
  administrative privileges, which violate the principle of least privilege. It is
  crucial to audit permissions regularly and ensure service accounts have only the
  necessary permissions for their functions. Remediation involves reviewing roles
  attached to service accounts and removing unnecessary admin-level roles, such as
  'roles/owner' or 'roles/editor', replacing them with more granular roles as needed.
