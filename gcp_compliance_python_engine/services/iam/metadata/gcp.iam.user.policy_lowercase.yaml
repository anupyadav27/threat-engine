title: IAM Policies Should Use Lowercase Identifiers
rationale: Using lowercase identifiers in IAM policies reduces the risk of configuration
  errors caused by case sensitivity, preventing unauthorized access due to mismatches
  in policy definitions. This practice enhances consistency and aligns with best security
  practices, aiding in maintaining a clear audit trail and compliance with regulatory
  standards like SOC2 and ISO 27001.
description: This rule checks IAM policies to ensure all identifiers are in lowercase
  format. This includes roles, permissions, and other policy components that are case
  sensitive. To verify, review IAM policy configurations in the GCP Console or via
  gcloud CLI, ensuring identifiers are uniformly lowercase. Remediation involves updating
  policy files and applying changes using the gcloud CLI or directly through the GCP
  Console.
