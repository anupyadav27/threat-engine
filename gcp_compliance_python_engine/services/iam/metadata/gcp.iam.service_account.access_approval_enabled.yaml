title: Ensure Access Approval is Enabled for Service Accounts
rationale: Enabling Access Approval for service accounts mitigates unauthorized access
  by requiring explicit approval before access is granted to sensitive resources.
  This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized operations, aligning with
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and SOC2, which mandate strict access controls
  and audit capabilities.
description: This rule verifies that Access Approval is enabled for all Google Cloud
  service accounts to enforce a secondary approval process before granting access
  to sensitive resources. Administrators need to configure Access Approval in the
  Google Cloud Console under 'Security' settings for each service account. Regularly
  review and audit Access Approval configurations to ensure compliance with organizational
  security policies and standards.
