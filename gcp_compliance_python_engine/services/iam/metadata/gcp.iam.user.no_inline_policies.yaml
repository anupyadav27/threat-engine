requirement: No Inline Policies

subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Restrict User Inline Policies in IAM
rationale: Inline policies increase complexity and risk of misconfiguration, leading
  to excessive permissions and potential unauthorized access. Centralized policy management
  helps maintain a consistent security posture, ensuring compliance with regulations
  like ISO 27001 and SOC 2 by reducing risk of privilege escalation.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline policies attached directly
  to IAM users. Inline policies can lead to inconsistent access controls and are harder
  to audit and manage. Instead, use IAM roles with managed policies to achieve a centralized
  and standardized permission model. To remediate, identify users with inline policies
  and migrate these permissions to IAM roles with predefined policies.
