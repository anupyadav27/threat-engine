requirement: Root Hardware MFA Enabled

subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Ensure Root Account Hardware MFA is Enabled
rationale: Enabling hardware MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk
  of unauthorized access by adding an additional layer of security. This is critical
  because the root account has extensive permissions and control over the entire GCP
  environment. Compromise of this account can lead to full exposure of data and resources,
  resulting in severe business and financial impacts. Compliance with standards such
  as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 also necessitates robust authentication controls.
description: This rule checks if the root account in GCP has hardware MFA enabled.
  To verify, ensure that the root user has a hardware security key or other approved
  MFA device configured. Remediation involves accessing the Google Cloud Console,
  navigating to the 'Security' section of the account settings, and adding a hardware
  MFA device to the root account. This enhancement prevents unauthorized access and
  aligns with best practices for securing privileged accounts.
