title: Ensure No User-Managed Keys in IAM for Enhanced Security
rationale: User-managed keys introduce significant security risks as they are prone
  to loss, unauthorized access, and lack of lifecycle management controls. Using these
  keys can lead to potential data breaches and non-compliance with regulations like
  PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which require robust access controls and key management practices.
description: This rule checks for the presence of user-managed keys in IAM user accounts,
  as these keys are not centrally managed and can bypass security policies. To verify,
  audit IAM users for any non-service account keys and transition to using Google-managed
  keys or service accounts for automated processes. Remediation involves revoking
  user-managed keys and configuring IAM roles with least privilege using Google-managed
  keys.
