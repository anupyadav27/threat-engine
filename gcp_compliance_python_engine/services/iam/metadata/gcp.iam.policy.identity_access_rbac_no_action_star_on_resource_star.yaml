subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Restrict IAM Action Star on Resource Star
rationale: Allowing all actions on all resources can lead to excessive permissions,
  increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. This setup can violate
  compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS and SOC2, which mandate least privilege
  access. Misuse of such permissions could result in data loss, service disruption,
  and financial penalties.
description: 'This rule checks for IAM policies where any identity has been granted
  wildcard (*) permissions on all resources (*). To verify, review IAM policies in
  the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud CLI for any entries with ''action: *''
  and ''resource: *''. Remediation involves revising these policies to specify exact
  actions and resources required, aligning with the principle of least privilege.'
