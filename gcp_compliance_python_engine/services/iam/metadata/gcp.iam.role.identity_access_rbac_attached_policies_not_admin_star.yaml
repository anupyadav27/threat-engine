title: Ensure IAM Roles Avoid Admin * Permissions
rationale: Assigning overly permissive roles with wildcard permissions like '*' can
  lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This exposure may violate
  compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and SOC2, and can result in significant financial
  and reputational damage if exploited by malicious actors.
description: This rule checks for IAM roles that have attached policies with overly
  broad permissions such as 'admin *'. These permissions should be avoided because
  they grant more access than necessary, contradicting the principle of least privilege.
  Review and modify the IAM roles to ensure they only include necessary permissions.
  This can be verified by listing all IAM roles and inspecting their associated policies,
  ensuring no wildcards are present in critical permissions.
