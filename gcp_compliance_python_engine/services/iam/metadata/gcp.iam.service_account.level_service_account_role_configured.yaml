title: Service Account Role Configured for Least Privilege
rationale: Configuring service account roles with the principle of least privilege
  minimizes the attack surface by restricting permissions to only those necessary
  for tasks. This reduces the risk of privilege escalation and potential unauthorized
  access, which can lead to data breaches or service disruptions. Ensuring roles are
  appropriately configured is also crucial for compliance with standards such as NIST
  and ISO 27001, which require strict access controls.
description: This rule checks if service accounts in GCP have been assigned roles
  that adhere to the principle of least privilege. It verifies that no over-privileged
  roles are configured, which could grant excessive permissions beyond what is necessary.
  To remediate, audit all service account roles and ensure each is appropriately scoped,
  removing any unnecessary permissions. Verification can be done via the GCP Console
  or gcloud CLI by examining role assignments and adjusting them to align with operational
  needs.
