title: Restrict Administrative Privileges for Service Accounts
rationale: Service accounts with excessive administrative privileges pose significant
  security risks, including potential unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Limiting
  these privileges helps mitigate insider threats and reduces the attack surface.
  Compliance with frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001 often requires implementing least
  privilege principles, which is crucial for maintaining a secure cloud environment.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud service accounts have been assigned
  administrative privileges that are not necessary for their function. It verifies
  the IAM roles and permissions associated with each service account to ensure they
  adhere to the principle of least privilege. To remediate, review and adjust the
  IAM policies to remove unnecessary administrative roles from service accounts, ensuring
  they only have permissions essential to their tasks.
