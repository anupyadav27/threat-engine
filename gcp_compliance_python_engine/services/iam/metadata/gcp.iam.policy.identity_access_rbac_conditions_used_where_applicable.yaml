title: Ensure Use of Conditional Access in IAM Policies
rationale: Conditional access in IAM policies allows for fine-grained control over
  resource access, reducing the risk of over-permissioned roles. It mitigates potential
  unauthorized access by enforcing conditions like time-based access or IP restrictions.
  This aligns with compliance frameworks requiring least privilege and adaptive access
  controls, thereby reducing the attack surface and enhancing overall security posture.
description: This rule checks if IAM policies utilize RBAC conditions where applicable,
  such as using 'conditions' in role bindings to specify context-aware access controls.
  Verifying implementation involves reviewing IAM policy bindings for conditional
  logic. Remediation includes updating IAM policies to incorporate conditions, like
  resource attributes, request attributes, or environment attributes, to enforce contextual
  access controls.
