requirement: Identity Access Workload Identity Federation Used Supported

domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Use of Workload Identity Federation for Service Accounts
rationale: Using Workload Identity Federation reduces the risk of long-lived credentials
  being compromised. It allows external identities to access GCP resources without
  using service account keys, aligning with best practices for secure identity management.
  This approach also aids in meeting compliance requirements by minimizing the attack
  surface associated with credential management.
description: This rule checks whether Workload Identity Federation is used to authenticate
  workloads using external identities instead of traditional service account keys.
  To verify, ensure that workloads are set up to utilize Workload Identity Pools and
  Providers, allowing secure access management. Remediation involves configuring identity
  pools and updating workloads to authenticate using the federation, removing any
  direct service account key dependencies.
