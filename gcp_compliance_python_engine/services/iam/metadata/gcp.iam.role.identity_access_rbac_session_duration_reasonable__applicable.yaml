title: Ensure Reasonable IAM Role Session Duration
rationale: Restricting IAM role session duration reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and minimizes the impact of credential theft. Shorter sessions limit the
  time window in which compromised credentials can be exploited, aligning with regulatory
  requirements and best practices for secure identity management.
description: This rule checks for IAM roles with session durations exceeding recommended
  limits. Session durations should be set to a reasonable timeframe, typically not
  exceeding an hour, to balance usability and security. Administrators can verify
  and adjust session durations through the IAM settings in the Google Cloud Console
  or via gcloud commands. Reducing session duration is a key step in mitigating extended
  unauthorized access risks.
