title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication for Console Access
rationale: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for GCP console access significantly
  reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. MFA protects
  sensitive resources and data from being accessed by attackers exploiting weak or
  stolen passwords, thus safeguarding against potential data breaches and financial
  losses. Additionally, it helps meet compliance requirements for standards such as
  PCI-DSS, NIST, and ISO 27001 that mandate strong authentication mechanisms.
description: This rule checks that all users accessing the GCP console have MFA enabled
  on their accounts. To verify, review the IAM policies and ensure that MFA is required
  for all users. Remediation involves configuring IAM settings to enforce MFA, which
  can be done via the Google Cloud Console under the 'Security' section or by using
  the gcloud command-line tool. It is critical to communicate and enforce this policy
  across all teams to ensure compliance and security.
