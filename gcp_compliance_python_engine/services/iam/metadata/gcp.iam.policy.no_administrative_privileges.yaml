resource: policy
requirement: No Administrative Privileges

domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Restrict IAM Policies to Prevent Excessive Privileges
rationale: Limiting administrative privileges in IAM policies reduces the risk of
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Excessive permissions can lead
  to accidental or malicious misuse, compromising the integrity and confidentiality
  of cloud resources. Ensuring least privilege aligns with regulatory requirements
  and helps protect sensitive information from internal and external threats.
description: This rule checks IAM policies to ensure that no user or service account
  is granted administrative roles, such as Owner or Editor, unless absolutely necessary.
  Review and modify IAM policies to follow the principle of least privilege by assigning
  roles with only the required permissions. Use the 'IAM Recommender' tool to get
  suggestions for role adjustments. Regularly audit IAM policies and update them to
  remove unnecessary permissions.
