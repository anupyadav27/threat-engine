title: Ensure Service Account Keys Rotated Every 90 Days
rationale: Regular rotation of service account keys mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access due to key compromise. Stale or unused keys can be exploited by attackers
  to gain prolonged access to critical resources, potentially leading to data breaches
  or service disruptions. Compliance with regulatory frameworks often requires strict
  key management practices, ensuring the organization meets legal and industry standards.
description: This rule checks for service account identity access keys in Google Cloud
  Platform that have not been used or rotated within the last 90 days. To verify compliance,
  review the 'Last Used' and 'Created' timestamps of all service account keys. Remediation
  involves disabling and deleting any stale keys and generating new ones as necessary,
  ensuring that key access is logged and monitored. Implement automated processes
  to enforce key rotation policies and reduce human error.
