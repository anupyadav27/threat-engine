title: Detect and Manage Unused User-Managed IAM Keys
rationale: Unused IAM keys can pose a significant security risk as they may become
  vulnerable to unauthorized access or misuse over time. Regularly auditing and removing
  unused keys reduces the attack surface and helps maintain compliance with security
  frameworks such as NIST, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001, thereby protecting sensitive data
  and resources.
description: This rule checks for user-managed IAM keys that have not been used for
  an extended period, indicating potential neglect or abandonment. To verify, examine
  the last used timestamp of IAM keys in the GCP console or via the gcloud CLI. If
  a key is identified as unused for over 90 days, it should be evaluated for necessity
  and either rotated or deleted to mitigate security risks. Ensuring keys are actively
  managed aligns with best practices for key management and access control.
