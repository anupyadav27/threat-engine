title: Ensure IAM User Passwords Minimum Length of 14 Characters
rationale: Setting a minimum password length of 14 characters for IAM users helps
  mitigate the risk of unauthorized access through brute force attacks. Longer passwords
  significantly increase the computational effort required to crack them, enhancing
  the security of sensitive data and systems. This practice is essential for compliance
  with standards such as NIST SP 800-63 and supports the protection of organizational
  assets and user identities.
description: This rule checks whether IAM user passwords adhere to a minimum length
  of 14 characters. To enforce this policy, configure the password policy within your
  identity management settings. Verifying compliance involves reviewing IAM password
  policies and updating them if necessary to meet the required length. Remediation
  includes accessing the Google Cloud Console, navigating to the IAM settings, and
  setting the password policy to enforce a minimum length of 14 characters.
