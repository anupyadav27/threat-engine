rule_id: gcp.iam.service_account.account_role_check_admin_privileges
service: iam
resource: service_account
requirement: Account Role Check Admin Privileges
scope: iam.service_account.least_privilege
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Ensure Service Accounts Lack Admin Privileges
rationale: Service accounts with excessive privileges pose a severe security risk,
  as they can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to resources, escalate privileges,
  and compromise the entire cloud environment. Adhering to the principle of least
  privilege is crucial for minimizing attack surfaces and meeting compliance requirements
  such as PCI-DSS and NIST.
description: This rule checks that service accounts do not possess admin roles or
  equivalent high-privilege roles, which could lead to unauthorized access and control
  over GCP resources. To verify, review IAM policies and ensure that service accounts
  are granted only the necessary roles for their intended function. Remediation involves
  auditing current permissions, removing unnecessary admin roles, and using custom
  roles to enforce least privilege.
