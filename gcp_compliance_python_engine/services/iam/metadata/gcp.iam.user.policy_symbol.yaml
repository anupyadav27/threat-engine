title: Ensure User IAM Policies Do Not Use Symbols
rationale: Using symbols in IAM policy names can lead to potential parsing errors
  and misconfiguration risks, impacting access control and security posture. Properly
  named policies enhance clarity, reduce human error, and support compliance with
  standards that require clear and auditable access controls.
description: This rule checks that IAM policies for users do not contain symbols in
  their names. Symbols can complicate parsing and integration with other systems,
  leading to misconfigurations or security loopholes. It is recommended to use alphanumeric
  characters and underscores for policy names. To remediate, review and rename policies
  with symbols to a more standardized naming convention, ensuring consistent application
  of security policies.
