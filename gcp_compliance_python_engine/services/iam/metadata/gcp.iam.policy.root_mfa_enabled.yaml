requirement: Root MFA Enabled

subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Root Account MFA Must Be Enabled
rationale: Enabling MFA for the root account significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access, which can lead to data breaches and compromise of critical resources. Root
  accounts have extensive privileges, making them a prime target for attackers. Ensuring
  MFA is enabled aligns with security best practices and compliance with standards
  like NIST SP 800-53 and PCI-DSS, protecting organizational integrity and data confidentiality.
description: This rule checks if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for
  the root account in Google Cloud Platform. MFA adds an additional layer of security,
  requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the user
  has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have immediately
  to hand. To verify and enable MFA, navigate to the IAM & Admin section in the GCP
  Console, select the root account, and ensure MFA is configured. Remediation involves
  setting up an authenticator application or enabling SMS-based verification if not
  already configured.
