title: Limit IAM User Policy Bindings to Necessary Minimum
rationale: Excessive IAM policy bindings for users can lead to unauthorized access
  and privilege escalation, increasing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and ISO 27001. Limiting policy bindings helps maintain
  the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface and potential exploitation
  of elevated permissions.
description: This rule checks the number of IAM policy bindings assigned to user accounts
  in GCP. It identifies users with an excessive number of roles and permissions, which
  should be minimized to only what is necessary for their job functions. To verify,
  review IAM policies in the Google Cloud Console under 'IAM & Admin' and remove any
  unnecessary roles. Remediation involves auditing current permissions and adjusting
  policy bindings to align with least privilege principles.
