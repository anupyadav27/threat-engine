title: Ensure Absence of User-Managed Keys for Service Accounts
rationale: User-managed keys for service accounts pose a security risk as they can
  be easily exposed, leading to unauthorized access. This exposure can result in data
  breaches or service disruptions, violating compliance with standards like PCI-DSS
  and ISO 27001. Ensuring keys are only managed by Google mitigates these risks and
  aligns with best practices for secure identity management.
description: This rule checks for the presence of user-managed keys for Google Cloud
  Platform service accounts. User-managed keys should be avoided because they require
  manual management, increasing the risk of mismanagement or accidental exposure.
  To verify, list the service account keys and ensure all keys are Google-managed.
  If user-managed keys are detected, delete them and recreate the access using Google-managed
  keys to enhance security and compliance.
