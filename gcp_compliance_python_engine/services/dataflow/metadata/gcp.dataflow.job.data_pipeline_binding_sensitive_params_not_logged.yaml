title: Prevent Logging of Sensitive Params in Dataflow Jobs
rationale: Logging sensitive parameters in Dataflow jobs can expose confidential information,
  leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. This rule helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
  data, protecting organizational assets and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks that Dataflow jobs do not log sensitive parameters,
  which can occur if logging levels are misconfigured. To verify, ensure that logging
  configurations exclude sensitive data by checking job settings in the GCP Console
  or using the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves adjusting logging settings
  to mask or exclude sensitive information from being logged.
