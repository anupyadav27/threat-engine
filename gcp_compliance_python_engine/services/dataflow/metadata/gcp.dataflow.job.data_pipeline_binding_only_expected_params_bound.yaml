title: Ensure Dataflow Job Parameters Are Properly Bound
rationale: Ensuring that only expected parameters are bound in Dataflow jobs is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized data access and manipulation. Improper parameter binding
  can lead to data leakage, unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance breaches,
  affecting the organization's data integrity and confidentiality. This is particularly
  important for meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA that mandate
  strict data protection controls.
description: This rule checks that Dataflow jobs only bind expected parameters, which
  helps prevent injection attacks and unauthorized data access. Verify that Dataflow
  job configurations do not include extraneous parameters and that all parameters
  are explicitly defined in job templates. Remediation involves auditing the job configurations
  and removing any unexpected or unnecessary parameters, ensuring that the job adheres
  to the security policies defined by your organization.
