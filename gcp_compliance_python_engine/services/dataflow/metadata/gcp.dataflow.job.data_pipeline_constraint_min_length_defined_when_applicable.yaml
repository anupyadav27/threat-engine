title: Ensure Dataflow Pipeline Min Length Constraint Is Defined
rationale: Defining a minimum length constraint for data pipelines in Dataflow is
  crucial to prevent data breaches by ensuring that data fields meet necessary security
  and integrity requirements. This minimizes the risk of processing incomplete or
  malformed data, which can lead to data leakage or processing errors that compromise
  data privacy. Compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS often
  demands stringent data integrity checks.
description: This rule verifies whether a minimum length constraint is defined for
  applicable data pipelines within Dataflow jobs. To check compliance, inspect the
  pipeline configurations to ensure that all relevant data fields have an explicitly
  set minimum length constraint. If not configured, modify the Dataflow job settings
  to include these constraints, ensuring that sensitive data is processed with appropriate
  length validations, enhancing data integrity and security.
