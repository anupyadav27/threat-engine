title: Enable Dataflow Job Data Pipeline Object Logging
rationale: Enabling logging for Dataflow jobs provides visibility into data processing
  activities, crucial for detecting anomalies and unauthorized access. This enhances
  the ability to respond to security incidents and supports compliance with data protection
  regulations like GDPR and SOC 2, which require audit trails for data processing
  activities.
description: This rule checks if Dataflow jobs have object logging enabled to record
  interactions with data pipeline components. Verify logging settings in the Dataflow
  console under the job's configuration or via the Google Cloud CLI. To enable logging,
  adjust job configurations to include appropriate logging flags. Ensure that logs
  are stored securely and monitored for suspicious activities.
