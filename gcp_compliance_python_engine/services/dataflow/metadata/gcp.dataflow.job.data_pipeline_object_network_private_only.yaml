title: Ensure Dataflow Jobs Use Private Network for Data Pipeline
rationale: Utilizing private networks for Dataflow jobs minimizes exposure to the
  public internet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This practice is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, particularly
  for organizations handling sensitive information or adhering to strict compliance
  standards like PCI-DSS or HIPAA.
description: This rule checks that Dataflow jobs are configured to use private IPs
  for data pipeline operations, ensuring network traffic remains within Google Cloud's
  secure network. To verify, inspect Dataflow job configurations for the use of 'enablePrivateIps'
  within the 'network' settings. Remediation involves setting 'enablePrivateIps' to
  true in the Dataflow job configuration to route traffic through private IPs only,
  thereby enhancing network security.
