subcategory: network_access_control
severity: low
title: Ensure Dataflow Pipeline Definitions are Stored Privately
rationale: Storing Dataflow pipeline definitions in publicly accessible locations
  can expose sensitive configuration details and business logic, increasing the risk
  of data breaches and unauthorized access. Keeping these definitions private helps
  mitigate potential attacks and aligns with compliance requirements for data protection
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that Dataflow job pipeline definitions are stored
  in private locations, preventing unauthorized access. To ensure privacy, configure
  Google Cloud Storage buckets containing pipeline definitions with IAM policies that
  restrict access to only necessary service accounts and users. Regularly audit bucket
  permissions to maintain security posture. Remediation involves adjusting bucket
  permissions via the Google Cloud Console or using gcloud commands to enforce private
  access.
