title: Enable Bucket Retention Policies for Immutable Data
rationale: Implementing immutable retention policies for storage buckets is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized modifications and deletions, which
  is vital for maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulations like GDPR
  and HIPAA. Immutable retention ensures that once data is stored, it cannot be altered,
  mitigating risks from insider threats and accidental data loss.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Storage buckets have an immutable retention
  policy locked, which prevents any changes to the data until the retention period
  expires. To verify, ensure that the 'retentionPolicy' is set and locked on the bucket
  configuration. If not configured, apply a policy using the GCP Console or gcloud
  CLI by setting 'retention-policy' and locking it to prevent modifications. This
  action ensures long-term data integrity and adherence to data governance standards.
