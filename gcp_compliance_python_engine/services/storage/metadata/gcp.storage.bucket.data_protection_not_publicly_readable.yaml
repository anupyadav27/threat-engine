title: Ensure Storage Buckets Are Not Publicly Readable
rationale: Publicly readable storage buckets can lead to unauthorized data access,
  exposing sensitive information to anyone on the internet. This can result in data
  breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance with regulations
  like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Ensuring buckets are not publicly readable mitigates
  these risks and protects organizational data integrity.
description: This rule checks if any Google Cloud Storage buckets are configured to
  allow public read access. Public access can be verified through the bucket's permissions
  settings, specifically by examining the IAM policy bindings and ensuring that 'allUsers'
  or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' are not granted 'roles/storage.objectViewer' or higher.
  To remediate, remove any public access permissions and implement granular access
  controls based on the principle of least privilege.
