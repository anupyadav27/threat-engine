rule_id: gcp.storage.bucket.data_protection_policy_denies_public_and_insecure
service: storage
resource: bucket
requirement: Data Protection Policy Denies Public And Insecure
scope: storage.bucket.public_access
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Enforce Private and Secure GCP Storage Bucket Access
rationale: Exposing storage buckets to the public or allowing weak security configurations
  can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and violation of compliance standards
  such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA. Protecting sensitive data is critical to maintaining
  trust and avoiding costly data leakage incidents.
description: This rule ensures that GCP storage buckets are not publicly accessible
  and do not use insecure configurations. It checks for bucket policies that allow
  public access and weak authentication settings. To comply, ensure bucket policies
  explicitly deny public access, and use IAM roles to restrict access to authenticated
  and authorized users only. Review and update bucket configurations via the GCP Console
  or CLI to enforce these constraints.
