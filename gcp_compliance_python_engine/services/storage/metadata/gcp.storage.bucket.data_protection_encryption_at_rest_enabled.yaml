title: Ensure Storage Bucket Encryption At Rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access
  and is crucial for protecting sensitive information stored in Google Cloud Storage.
  Without encryption, data breaches can lead to severe financial and reputational
  damage. Compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA often mandates encryption
  to protect personal and financial information.
description: This rule checks if Cloud Storage buckets have server-side encryption
  enabled to protect data at rest. By default, Google Cloud encrypts all data using
  Google-managed keys, but you can enhance security by using Customer-Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) for added control. Verify encryption settings in the Google Cloud Console
  under the 'Encryption' section of the bucket settings, and ensure that CMEK is configured
  if required by your organization's policy.
