title: Ensure GCP Storage Bucket Versioning is Enabled
rationale: Enabling versioning on GCP storage buckets provides a critical layer of
  protection against accidental deletions or overwrites, ensuring that previous versions
  of objects can be restored if needed. This is important for maintaining data integrity
  and availability, especially in scenarios involving human error or malicious activities.
  Additionally, versioning can aid in compliance with regulations that require data
  retention and recoverability.
description: This rule checks whether versioning is enabled on GCP storage buckets.
  To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, select 'Cloud Storage', and check
  the 'Versioning' configuration for each bucket. If versioning is not enabled, it
  can be activated by editing the bucket's settings and turning on 'Object Versioning'.
  This ensures that older versions of objects are preserved, allowing recovery if
  current data is lost or corrupted.
