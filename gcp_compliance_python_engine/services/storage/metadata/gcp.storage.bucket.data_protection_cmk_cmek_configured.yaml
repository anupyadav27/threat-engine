title: Ensure CMEK Configured for Storage Bucket Encryption
rationale: Encrypting data at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) enhances
  data security by giving organizations full control over the encryption keys, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access. This is crucial for meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate robust data protection measures. Failure to
  implement CMEK could lead to data breaches and regulatory penalties.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Storage buckets are configured to use
  Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data encryption at rest. To verify,
  check the bucket's configuration in the GCP Console or via the gcloud command-line
  tool to ensure a CMEK is specified. Remediation involves navigating to the 'Storage'
  section in the GCP Console, selecting the bucket, and configuring it to use a CMEK
  from Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
