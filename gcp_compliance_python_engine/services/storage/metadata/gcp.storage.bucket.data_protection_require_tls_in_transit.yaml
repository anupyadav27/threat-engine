title: Ensure Buckets Require TLS for Data in Transit
rationale: Requiring TLS for data in transit protects sensitive information from interception
  and tampering. This is crucial to maintain data confidentiality and integrity, especially
  for enterprises handling sensitive or personal data. Compliance with frameworks
  such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 often mandates encrypted data transmission,
  reducing legal and financial liabilities.
description: This rule checks if Google Cloud Storage buckets enforce TLS for data
  in transit. Buckets should be configured to only permit encrypted connections, ensuring
  data is protected from unauthorized access during transmission. To verify, ensure
  that the bucket's settings enforce secure connections using TLS. Remediation involves
  updating the bucket's policy to require TLS, which can be done via the GCP Console
  or by using the 'gsutil' command-line tool.
