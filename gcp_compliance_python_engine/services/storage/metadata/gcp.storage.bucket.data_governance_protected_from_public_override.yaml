service: storage
resource: bucket
requirement: Data Governance Protected From Public Override
scope: storage.bucket.public_access
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: critical
title: Prevent Public Access to Sensitive Storage Buckets
rationale: Unrestricted public access to storage buckets can lead to unauthorized
  data exposure, resulting in potential data breaches, financial loss, and reputational
  damage. This is critical for compliance with data protection regulations such as
  GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict access controls to safeguard personal and sensitive
  information.
description: This rule checks for any storage buckets that allow public overrides,
  ensuring that data governance policies are enforced and sensitive data is not exposed
  to public access. Specifically, it verifies that the 'allUsers' and 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
  entities are not granted access to buckets. Remediation involves reviewing and adjusting
  bucket IAM policies to restrict public access and implementing appropriate access
  controls to meet compliance requirements.
