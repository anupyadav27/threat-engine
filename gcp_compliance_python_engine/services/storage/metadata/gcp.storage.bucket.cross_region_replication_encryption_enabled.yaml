title: Ensure Cross Region Replication Encryption for GCP Buckets
rationale: Enabling encryption for cross-region replication in GCP storage buckets
  is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access during transit between
  regions. This mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized disclosures,
  which can lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks if cross-region replication for GCP storage buckets
  is encrypted to secure data during transit. To verify, ensure that the 'replication'
  configuration in the bucket settings includes 'data encryption' enabled. If not
  configured, enable encryption by updating the bucket replication policy to include
  encryption options, utilizing either Google-managed or customer-managed encryption
  keys to meet compliance and security requirements.
