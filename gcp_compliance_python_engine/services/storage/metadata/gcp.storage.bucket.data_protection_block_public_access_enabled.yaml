subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: critical
title: Ensure Block Public Access on Storage Buckets is Enabled
rationale: Public access to storage buckets can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive
  information to unauthorized users. Enabling block public access is critical to prevent
  inadvertent exposure of data, which can have severe business impacts, including
  financial losses, reputational damage, and non-compliance with regulations such
  as GDPR and PCI-DSS.
description: This rule checks if the 'Block Public Access' setting is enabled on Google
  Cloud Storage buckets to ensure no public access is permitted. To verify, navigate
  to the Google Cloud Console, select the Storage service, and review the bucket's
  permissions settings. Remediation involves setting 'Block Public Access' to 'on'
  for all applicable buckets through the console or using gcloud CLI to update bucket
  IAM policies, ensuring that no 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' permissions
  are granted.
