title: Ensure Object Retention Policies Are Configured for Buckets
rationale: Configuring object retention policies in GCP Storage buckets is critical
  to prevent accidental or malicious data deletion, ensuring data integrity and availability.
  This is particularly important for compliance with data retention regulations and
  standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA, which mandate specific data retention periods.
  Without these policies, organizations risk data breaches, legal penalties, and loss
  of data critical for business operations.
description: This check verifies that each GCP Storage bucket has an object retention
  policy configured, ensuring data cannot be deleted or overwritten until a specified
  retention period has elapsed. To verify, review the bucket's settings in the GCP
  Console under the 'Retention' section of the bucket's 'Lifecycle' settings. Remediation
  involves setting a retention policy by specifying the desired period and enabling
  the policy, which can be done through the GCP Console or by using the 'gsutil retention
  set' command.
