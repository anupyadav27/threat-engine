title: Ensure GCS Buckets Do Not Allow Public Access
rationale: Public access to Google Cloud Storage buckets can lead to unauthorized
  data exposure, potentially resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
  Protecting sensitive data is crucial for maintaining customer trust and adhering
  to regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Unauthorized access can lead to
  financial losses and damage to organizational reputation.
description: This rule checks if any Google Cloud Storage buckets are publicly accessible.
  Publicly accessible buckets may allow unauthorized users to read, write, or delete
  data. Ensure that the bucket's IAM policy does not grant 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
  roles, and review ACL settings to restrict access. Remediation involves updating
  bucket permissions to limit access to trusted identities only, using the GCP Console
  or CLI.
