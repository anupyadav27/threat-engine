title: Prevent Public Access to Storage Buckets
rationale: Publicly accessible storage buckets can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  individuals, leading to data breaches. This can result in financial losses, reputational
  damage, and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA, which
  mandate data protection and privacy.
description: This rule checks for any Google Cloud Storage buckets that are configured
  to allow public access. Buckets should be configured to restrict access to authenticated
  users only. To verify, inspect the bucket's ACL and IAM policies to ensure no public
  permissions are granted. To remediate, remove 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'
  from the bucket's permissions and apply the principle of least privilege.
