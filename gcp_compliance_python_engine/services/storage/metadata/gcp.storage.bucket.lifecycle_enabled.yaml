title: Ensure Bucket Lifecycle Management is Enabled
rationale: Enabling lifecycle management for GCP Storage buckets helps automate data
  retention policies, reducing storage costs by transitioning objects to appropriate
  storage classes or deleting them when they are no longer needed. This prevents accumulation
  of unnecessary data and mitigates potential data breaches by ensuring that sensitive
  data is not retained longer than required.
description: This rule checks if lifecycle management policies are configured for
  GCP Storage buckets. These policies define actions such as transitioning objects
  to cheaper storage classes or deleting them after a certain period. To verify, review
  the bucket configuration in the GCP Console or use the 'gsutil lifecycle get' command.
  Remediate by setting up lifecycle policies either via the console or by using JSON
  configuration files with 'gsutil lifecycle set'.
