title: Ensure Bucket Lifecycle Management for Compute Disk Replication
rationale: Enabling lifecycle management for GCP Storage Buckets ensures that data
  is automatically managed and retained according to policy, thereby optimizing cost
  and compliance. Without proper lifecycle management, organizations risk accumulating
  outdated or unnecessary data, which can lead to increased storage costs and potential
  non-compliance with data retention policies. Additionally, replication of compute
  disk snapshots without lifecycle policies can result in excessive and unmanaged
  data growth.
description: This rule checks if lifecycle management is enabled on GCP Storage Buckets
  used for replicating GCP Compute Disk snapshots. Lifecycle policies should be configured
  to automatically delete or transition data to cheaper storage classes after a specified
  period. To verify, review the bucket's lifecycle settings in the GCP Console or
  use the gcloud command-line tool. Remediation involves setting up lifecycle rules
  to manage the retention of disk snapshot data appropriately, ensuring compliance
  with organizational data management policies.
