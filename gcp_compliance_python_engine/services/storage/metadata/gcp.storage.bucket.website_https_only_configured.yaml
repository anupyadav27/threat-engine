title: Enforce HTTPS for GCP Storage Bucket Website Config
rationale: Configuring your GCP Storage Bucket to serve content only via HTTPS ensures
  data in transit is encrypted, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and maintaining
  data integrity. This is crucial for compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS and
  HIPAA, which mandate secure transmission of sensitive information. Failing to enforce
  HTTPS could expose sensitive data to attackers, leading to data breaches and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks if GCP Storage Buckets configured as static websites
  enforce HTTPS connections. To verify, ensure that the bucket's website configuration
  has the 'https://www.example.com' URL format and does not allow 'http://'. Remediation
  involves updating the bucket's configuration to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS,
  ensuring all data transfers are encrypted. This can be configured via the Google
  Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool.
