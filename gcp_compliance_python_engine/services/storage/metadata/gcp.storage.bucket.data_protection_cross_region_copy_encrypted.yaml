title: Ensure Cross-Region Bucket Copies are Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting cross-region bucket copies is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data against unauthorized access, especially during transit over potentially insecure
  networks. This helps mitigate risks such as data breaches, which can lead to financial
  loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA
  that mandate data protection.
description: This rule checks if cross-region copies of Cloud Storage buckets are
  configured to use encryption. Ensure that all bucket transfers between regions use
  either Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. Verify this by inspecting
  bucket settings in the GCP Console or using the gcloud CLI. Remediation involves
  updating bucket settings to enforce encryption during cross-region data transfers.
