service: storage
resource: bucket
requirement: Data Governance Enforced On Sensitive Datasets
scope: storage.bucket.security
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
severity: low
title: Ensure Data Governance on Sensitive Storage Buckets
rationale: Enforcing data governance on sensitive datasets is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and data breaches, which can lead to financial loss and reputational damage.
  It ensures compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict
  data protection and privacy measures. Without proper governance, organizations risk
  non-compliance, leading to potential fines and legal repercussions.
description: This rule checks whether data governance policies are enforced on storage
  buckets containing sensitive datasets. It involves verifying that access controls,
  encryption settings, and audit logging are properly configured. To remedy any deficiencies,
  ensure that IAM policies limit access to authorized users only, enable Object Versioning
  to preserve data integrity, and use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for
  enhanced data protection. Regularly review and update access permissions and audit
  logs to ensure ongoing compliance.
