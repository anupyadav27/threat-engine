title: Ensure Versioning is Enabled for GCP Storage Buckets
rationale: Enabling versioning on GCP storage buckets is crucial for data recovery
  and integrity. It helps protect against accidental deletion or modification of objects,
  ensuring that previous versions can be restored if needed. This practice mitigates
  risks associated with data loss and supports compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and CCPA.
description: This rule checks if versioning is enabled on GCP storage buckets. Versioning
  allows you to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket and retrieve
  previous versions when necessary. To verify and enable versioning, navigate to the
  Google Cloud Console, select the storage bucket, and check the 'Versioning' status
  under the 'Lifecycle' settings. If not enabled, activate versioning through the
  console or by using the 'gsutil' command-line tool with the command 'gsutil versioning
  set on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]'.
