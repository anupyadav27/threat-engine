title: Ensure Secure Configuration for Governance Delivery Channel
rationale: Misconfigured delivery channels can expose sensitive data to unauthorized
  entities, leading to potential data breaches or non-compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and CCPA. Ensuring secure destinations for governance data helps protect
  against unauthorized access and eavesdropping, reducing the risk of data leaks and
  enhancing the overall security posture.
description: This rule checks for the secure configuration of destination settings
  in the Governance Delivery Channel for GCP assets. It verifies that delivery channels
  are configured to send data to secure, authorized destinations using encrypted protocols
  (e.g., HTTPS, TLS). To verify, ensure that all delivery channel destinations are
  correctly configured with encryption and access controls. Remediation involves updating
  the delivery channel settings to use secure endpoints and validating access permissions.
