title: Ensure Least Privilege for Asset Feed Delivery Channel
rationale: Limiting access privileges for asset feed delivery channels minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data, ensuring compliance with security
  standards such as NIST and ISO 27001. By enforcing least privilege, organizations
  can reduce the attack surface and protect against potential data breaches and insider
  threats.
description: This rule verifies that the IAM policies associated with the destination
  of asset feed delivery channels are configured with the principle of least privilege.
  It checks for overly permissive roles that may grant unnecessary access to sensitive
  data. To remediate, review and adjust IAM policies to only include roles essential
  for operational needs, prioritizing roles with least privilege access. Regular audits
  should be performed to maintain compliance.
