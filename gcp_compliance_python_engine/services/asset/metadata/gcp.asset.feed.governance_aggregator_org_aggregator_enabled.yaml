title: Enable Governance Aggregator for Organization Asset Monitoring
rationale: Enabling Governance Aggregator Org Aggregator allows centralized visibility
  into asset changes across the organization, which is crucial for detecting unauthorized
  modifications, ensuring policy adherence, and maintaining compliance with regulatory
  frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27001. Without this feature, organizations risk
  missing critical asset changes that could lead to data breaches or non-compliance
  penalties.
description: This rule checks whether the Governance Aggregator Org Aggregator is
  enabled in GCP Asset Inventory. This feature aggregates asset data across all projects
  within an organization, providing a comprehensive view for security and compliance
  monitoring. To verify, ensure that asset feeds are configured with an organizational
  scope and that necessary permissions are granted. Remediation involves configuring
  the asset feed using Cloud Asset Inventory's API or Console, ensuring it's set to
  monitor organization-wide asset changes.
