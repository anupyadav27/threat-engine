service: asset

requirement: Governance Aggregation Authorization Present And Valid
scope: asset.feed.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Valid Authorization for Asset Feed Governance Aggregation
rationale: Proper authorization for governance aggregation is crucial as it ensures
  that only legitimate and verified entities can access and aggregate sensitive asset
  metadata. A lack of this oversight can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  or inadvertent exposure of confidential information, potentially resulting in non-compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.
description: This rule checks whether the authorization for asset feed governance
  aggregation is present and valid within GCP. It verifies that correct IAM policies
  are applied to ensure only authorized users or service accounts have access to create
  and manage asset feeds. To remediate any issues, review and update IAM policies
  to include only necessary permissions, ensuring that the principle of least privilege
  is adhered to. Regularly audit and validate these configurations to maintain compliance
  and security integrity.
