requirement: Governance Aggregation Authorization Not Expired Or Revoked
scope: asset.asset.authorization
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: medium
title: Ensure Governance Authorization is Valid and Not Revoked
rationale: Expired or revoked governance aggregation authorizations pose a risk by
  allowing unauthorized access to sensitive asset data, potentially leading to data
  breaches and non-compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR or SOC2. Maintaining
  valid authorizations ensures that only designated entities can view and aggregate
  asset data, mitigating unauthorized data access and maintaining organizational security
  posture.
description: This rule checks if governance aggregation authorizations for Google
  Cloud assets are neither expired nor revoked. It verifies that each authorization
  token used for asset aggregation is active and has not been revoked, ensuring secure
  and compliant aggregation processes. To remediate, review the asset governance authorization
  settings, renew expired authorizations, and revoke any that are no longer needed
  or have been compromised. Regularly auditing these settings helps maintain a secure
  and compliant environment.
