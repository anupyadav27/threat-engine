title: Enforce Least Privilege in Governance Aggregation Authorization
rationale: Ensuring that governance aggregation authorizations adhere to the principle
  of least privilege is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. This approach reduces the attack surface by ensuring that
  users or services have only the permissions necessary to perform their functions.
  Compliance with least privilege principles helps meet regulatory requirements such
  as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate strict access controls.
description: This rule checks that permissions granted for governance aggregation
  in Google Cloud are limited to the minimum necessary. Specifically, it verifies
  that roles assigned to service accounts or users for asset aggregation tasks do
  not exceed the required permissions. To verify, review IAM policies for roles associated
  with asset aggregation and adjust any overly permissive roles. Use predefined roles
  like 'roles/viewer' instead of 'roles/editor' or 'roles/owner'.
