title: Ensure Proper Authorization for Governance Aggregation
rationale: Proper authorization for governance aggregation in GCP is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Incorrect configurations may lead
  to unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data, posing compliance risks
  with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. This rule helps maintain the integrity and
  confidentiality of aggregated governance data across accounts.
description: This rule checks that target accounts for governance aggregation in GCP
  have the correct authorization settings. It verifies that only authorized accounts
  are allowed to aggregate governance data, preventing unauthorized access. To remediate,
  review IAM policies and ensure that only necessary accounts have permissions for
  governance aggregation. Confirm with the GCP Console or gcloud CLI that the IAM
  roles and permissions are correctly set for each target account.
