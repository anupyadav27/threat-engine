title: Auto-Enroll New Accounts in Governance Aggregator
rationale: Automatically enrolling new accounts in an asset governance aggregator
  ensures that all resources are monitored from the outset, reducing the risk of unmanaged
  assets which can lead to compliance failures and security vulnerabilities. This
  proactive approach supports regulatory compliance by maintaining visibility and
  control over the entire asset inventory as per standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST.
description: This rule verifies that new accounts are automatically enrolled in the
  Governance Aggregator within the GCP Asset service. It ensures that asset feeds
  are configured to include new projects, allowing for continuous security monitoring
  and compliance checks. To verify, check the asset feed configuration for automatic
  enrollment settings. Remediation involves setting up the asset feed with the necessary
  permissions and configuration to include new accounts by default.
