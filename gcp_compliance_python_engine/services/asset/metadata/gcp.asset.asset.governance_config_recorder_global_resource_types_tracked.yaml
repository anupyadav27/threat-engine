title: Track Global Resource Types with Governance Config Recorder
rationale: Ensuring that all global resource types in Google Cloud are tracked by
  the Governance Config Recorder is crucial for maintaining visibility and compliance
  across cloud assets. Failing to track these resources could lead to undetected policy
  violations, configuration drift, and security vulnerabilities, which could have
  significant business and regulatory impacts.
description: This check verifies that the Governance Config Recorder has been configured
  to track all global resource types across your Google Cloud environment. Administrators
  should ensure that the Asset Inventory service is properly set up to record changes
  in global resources, such as organization policies and IAM settings. To remediate,
  update the recorder settings to include all necessary global resource types and
  regularly review the asset inventory reports for anomalies.
