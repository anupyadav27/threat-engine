title: Ensure Governance Config Recorder is Enabled for Asset Monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Governance Config Recorder is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into asset configurations and changes within your GCP environment. This helps in
  identifying unauthorized alterations, ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks,
  and mitigating risks associated with misconfigurations or malicious activities.
  Without it, organizations may face compliance violations and increased security
  vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks if the Governance Config Recorder is enabled on your
  GCP assets. The Governance Config Recorder is a critical component for tracking
  configuration changes and maintaining a historical record of asset states. To verify,
  ensure that the Asset Inventory API is enabled and properly configured in your GCP
  project. Remediation involves enabling the API via the GCP Console under APIs &
  Services, and setting up the necessary permissions for continuous asset monitoring.
