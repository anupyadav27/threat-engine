requirement: Governance Delivery Channel KMS Encryption Enabled

domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: high
title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Asset Feed Governance Channels
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for asset feed governance channels is crucial to
  protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without
  encryption, data at rest could be exposed to malicious actors, leading to legal
  penalties and damage to the organization's reputation. This practice aligns with
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that encryption is enforced
  as a standard security measure.
description: This rule checks whether Cloud Asset Governance Delivery Channels have
  Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) encryption enabled. To verify, ensure
  that each asset feed within your GCP environment is configured to use a customer-managed
  encryption key (CMEK) from KMS. To remediate, navigate to the Cloud Console, select
  the appropriate asset feed, and configure it to use a CMEK. This ensures that all
  data transmitted through governance channels is encrypted at rest, using strong
  encryption standards.
