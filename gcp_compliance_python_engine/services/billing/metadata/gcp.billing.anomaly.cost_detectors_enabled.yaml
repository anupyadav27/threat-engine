title: Enable GCP Billing Cost Anomaly Detectors
rationale: Enabling cost anomaly detection in GCP billing helps organizations proactively
  identify unexpected charges, potentially indicating security breaches or misconfigurations.
  Early detection of billing anomalies can prevent financial loss and ensure compliance
  with budgetary constraints, aligning with governance and compliance frameworks.
description: This rule checks whether cost anomaly detectors are enabled in GCP billing.
  To verify, navigate to the 'Billing' section in the GCP Console, and ensure that
  anomaly detection is configured under 'Budgets & alerts.' If not enabled, configure
  cost anomaly detectors by setting thresholds and notification preferences to receive
  alerts on any unusual billing activities promptly.
