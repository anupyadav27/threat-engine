subcategory: security_monitoring
severity: low
title: Restrict Cost Savings Plan Purchase Permissions
rationale: Restricting permissions for purchasing Cost Savings Plans mitigates the
  risk of unauthorized financial commitments that could lead to unexpected expenses
  and budget overruns. It ensures that only authorized personnel with a clear understanding
  of the organization's financial strategy can make such purchases, aligning with
  financial governance policies and reducing the risk of financial mismanagement.
description: This rule checks that only designated IAM roles have permissions to purchase
  Cost Savings Plans in GCP. Specifically, it ensures that roles like 'roles/billing.admin'
  are assigned to users who are responsible for financial decisions. To verify, review
  IAM policies for the billing account and limit permissions using the principle of
  least privilege. Remediation involves auditing IAM policies and adjusting permissions
  as needed to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
