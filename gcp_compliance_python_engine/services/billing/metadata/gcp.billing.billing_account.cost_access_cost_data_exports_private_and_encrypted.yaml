service: billing
resource: billing_account
requirement: Cost Access Cost Data Exports Private And Encrypted
scope: billing.billing_account.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
severity: medium
title: Ensure Cost Data Exports are Private and Encrypted
rationale: Encrypting cost data exports ensures that sensitive financial information
  is protected from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This practice mitigates
  risks such as data leakage and supports compliance with financial regulations, safeguarding
  organizational reputation and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks that billing account cost data exports are configured
  to be private and encrypted at rest. To verify, ensure that cost data export settings
  are configured to use Google Cloud Storage buckets with default encryption enabled
  and access permissions restricted to necessary personnel. Remediation involves setting
  up a bucket with encryption and applying IAM policies to limit access.
