title: Ensure Billing Budget Cost Alert Thresholds Are Configured
rationale: Configuring cost alert thresholds in GCP billing budgets helps organizations
  proactively manage and monitor their cloud expenditure, preventing unexpected overspending.
  This is crucial for maintaining budget discipline and ensuring financial accountability.
  By setting cost alerts, businesses can mitigate the risk of financial mismanagement
  and align their cloud spending with strategic financial goals.
description: This rule checks if cost alert thresholds are configured for GCP billing
  budgets. Proper configuration involves setting thresholds at specific percentage
  levels of the budget that trigger notifications when exceeded. To verify, review
  your GCP Console under Billing > Budgets & alerts and ensure thresholds are set
  at strategic levels like 50%, 90%, and 100%. Remediation involves accessing the
  GCP Console and configuring these thresholds to align with your financial policies.
