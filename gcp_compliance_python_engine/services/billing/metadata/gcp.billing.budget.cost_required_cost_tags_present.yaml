title: Ensure Cost Tags are Present for GCP Billing Budgets
rationale: Having cost tags in place allows organizations to effectively track and
  allocate spending within GCP, ensuring financial accountability and enabling cost
  optimization. Without these tags, it becomes challenging to identify unnecessary
  expenditures and allocate costs accurately across departments, potentially leading
  to overspending and budget mismanagement. Regulatory requirements may also necessitate
  detailed financial reporting, making proper cost tagging essential for compliance.
description: This rule checks if all required cost tags are applied to GCP billing
  budgets. Cost tags help categorize and track expenses related to specific projects
  or departments within an organization. To verify compliance, ensure that each budget
  within your GCP billing account has the necessary tags applied. If tags are missing,
  update your budget settings in the GCP Console to include all required tags. This
  can typically be done under the 'Budgets & Alerts' section by editing the budget
  settings.
