title: Ensure Cost Alert Destinations Are Configured
rationale: Configuring cost alert destinations in GCP budgets helps organizations
  manage spending effectively, preventing unexpected costs and ensuring financial
  accountability. Without these alerts, businesses might exceed budgets, leading to
  financial risk and impacting profitability. Compliance frameworks often require
  monitoring of spending to manage financial risk, making this practice essential
  for adhering to standards like ISO 27001 and SOC2.
description: This rule checks whether cost alert destinations are configured within
  GCP budgets. To verify, ensure that each budget has designated alert recipients,
  such as email addresses, configured in the Google Cloud Console under 'Budgets &
  alerts' settings. Remediation involves accessing the 'Budgets & alerts' section,
  selecting a budget, and adding notification recipients to receive alerts when spending
  exceeds specified thresholds.
