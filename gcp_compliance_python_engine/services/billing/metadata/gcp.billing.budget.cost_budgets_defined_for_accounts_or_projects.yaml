title: Ensure Cost Budgets Are Set for GCP Projects or Accounts
rationale: Setting cost budgets for GCP projects or accounts is crucial to prevent
  unexpected overspending, which can lead to financial constraints and impact operational
  budgets. Without defined budgets, organizations risk exceeding financial limits,
  potentially violating internal governance policies or external compliance requirements
  related to cost management.
description: This rule checks whether cost budgets are established for GCP billing
  accounts or specific projects. A budget helps monitor spending and sends alerts
  when costs exceed defined thresholds. To verify, navigate to the Google Cloud Console,
  select 'Billing', and ensure that budgets are set under the 'Budgets & alerts' tab.
  To remediate, create a budget by specifying a target amount and configuring alert
  thresholds to align with financial policies.
