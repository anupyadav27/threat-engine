title: Ensure Billing Account Access Uses Least Privilege RBAC
rationale: Implementing least privilege for billing account access reduces the risk
  of unauthorized financial data exposure and potential mismanagement of billing settings,
  which could lead to financial loss or non-compliance with regulations requiring
  data confidentiality and integrity. Proper access control is crucial for maintaining
  organizational security posture and meeting compliance standards such as PCI-DSS
  and SOC 2.
description: This rule checks if billing account access is granted based on the principle
  of least privilege using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Ensure users have only
  the permissions necessary for their roles by assigning predefined roles such as
  'Billing Viewer' or 'Billing Admin' instead of overly permissive custom roles. Verify
  and adjust permissions through the Google Cloud Console by reviewing IAM policies
  for each billing account and removing excess permissions. Regular audits should
  be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
