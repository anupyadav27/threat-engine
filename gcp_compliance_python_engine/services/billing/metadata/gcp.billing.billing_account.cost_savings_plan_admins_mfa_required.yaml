service: billing
resource: billing_account
requirement: Cost Savings Plan Admins MFA Required
scope: billing.billing_account.authentication
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
severity: critical
title: Enable MFA for Cost Savings Plan Admins on Billing Accounts
rationale: Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Cost Savings Plan Admins
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized access to critical financial settings and data.
  This prevents potential financial losses and exposure of sensitive billing information,
  which could arise from compromised credentials. Ensuring MFA aligns with compliance
  requirements such as PCI-DSS and enhances security posture against identity-based
  threats.
description: This rule checks that all users with the 'Cost Savings Plan Admin' role
  on GCP billing accounts have MFA enabled. Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to
  unauthorized access from compromised passwords. Verify by reviewing identity settings
  in the IAM section of the GCP Console and ensure MFA is enforced for these users.
  Remediate by configuring identity policies to enforce MFA for all billing account
  administrators.
