severity: critical
title: Enforce MFA for Cost Access Admins on Billing Accounts
rationale: Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Cost Access Admins reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive billing data, which can lead to financial
  losses and data breaches. This practice helps to protect against credential theft
  and account hijacking, ensuring compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS and
  ISO 27001 that mandate strong authentication controls.
description: This rule checks whether MFA is enabled for users with Cost Access Admin
  privileges on GCP billing accounts. To verify, ensure that all IAM users with `billing.accounts.get`
  or `billing.accounts.list` permissions have MFA enforced through Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) policies. Remediation involves configuring IAM to require MFA for
  these roles, typically by enabling security key enforcement or app-based authentication
  for user accounts.
