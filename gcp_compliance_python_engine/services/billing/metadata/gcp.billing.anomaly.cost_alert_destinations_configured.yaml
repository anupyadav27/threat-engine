title: Ensure Billing Anomaly Cost Alert Destinations Configured
rationale: Configuring cost alert destinations for billing anomalies is crucial to
  timely detect and respond to unexpected expenses, which can indicate security breaches
  or misconfigurations leading to cost spikes. This reduces financial risk and ensures
  accountability in billing management, while supporting compliance with financial
  governance standards.
description: This rule checks if alert destinations are configured for billing anomalies
  in GCP. It requires setting up notifications to specific channels (e.g., email,
  Pub/Sub) to alert stakeholders of abnormal cost activities. To verify, ensure that
  alert policies are configured in the Cloud Console under Billing > Budgets & alerts,
  and specify destinations. Remediation involves setting up an alert policy with notification
  channels to promptly detect and handle billing anomalies.
