title: Enable Alerts for Untagged Resource Costs
rationale: Enabling alerts for untagged resource costs helps organizations identify
  and manage potential cost overruns due to misconfigured or untracked resources.
  This can mitigate the risk of unexpected expenses, ensure better budget adherence,
  and support financial compliance. Untagged resources can lead to inefficiencies
  and lack of accountability, impacting overall cloud cost management.
description: This rule checks that alerts are configured for resources without tags
  that incur costs, enabling proactive monitoring. To verify, ensure that budget alerts
  in the GCP Billing console are set up for untagged resource expenditures. Remediation
  involves configuring alerts via the GCP Console or using Cloud Monitoring to notify
  stakeholders when costs for untagged resources exceed predefined thresholds.
