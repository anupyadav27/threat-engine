title: Ensure Cost Severity Thresholds Are Configured for Billing Anomalies
rationale: Configuring cost severity thresholds is crucial to promptly identify unusual
  billing activities that could indicate misconfigurations or unauthorized usage,
  potentially leading to significant financial losses. It helps organizations detect
  and address anomalies before they escalate, ensuring budget adherence and financial
  governance. Compliance with financial controls and governance frameworks such as
  SOC2 and ISO 27001 often requires proactive monitoring of billing anomalies.
description: This rule checks whether cost severity thresholds have been configured
  for billing anomalies in GCP. Proper configuration involves setting thresholds that
  trigger alerts when billing exceeds expected levels, allowing for timely investigation.
  To verify, access the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Billing section, and
  ensure that anomaly detection is enabled with defined severity thresholds. Remediate
  by configuring these thresholds to align with your organization's budget and risk
  tolerance.
