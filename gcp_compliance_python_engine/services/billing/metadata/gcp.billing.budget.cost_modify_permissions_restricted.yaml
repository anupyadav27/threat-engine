title: Restrict Cost Modification Permissions for GCP Budgets
rationale: Restricting cost modification permissions for GCP budgets is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized changes that could lead to financial mismanagement and unexpected
  expenditures. This control helps mitigate insider threats, where individuals with
  excessive permissions might alter budget settings, resulting in budget overruns
  or misaligned financial reporting. Ensuring only authorized personnel have these
  permissions supports compliance with financial governance requirements and audit
  readiness.
description: This rule verifies that only designated users or groups have permissions
  to modify cost settings in GCP Budgets. To check this, review IAM roles assigned
  to users for billing accounts and ensure that only roles with necessary permissions,
  like 'Billing Account Admin', are assigned. Remediation involves auditing current
  IAM policies, revoking excessive permissions, and implementing least privilege principles
  by assigning roles like 'Billing Account Viewer' to users who do not need modification
  capabilities.
