title: Enforce Approval Workflow for Cost Savings Plans
rationale: Implementing an approval workflow for Cost Savings Plans helps prevent
  unauthorized commitments that could lead to unexpected financial liabilities. This
  measure mitigates risks of overspending and helps maintain budgetary control, ensuring
  alignment with strategic financial goals and compliance with organizational policies.
description: This rule checks if an approval workflow is in place for any Cost Savings
  Plans created under the billing account. The workflow should require authorization
  from designated stakeholders prior to plan activation. Verification involves reviewing
  the billing account's configuration settings to ensure that requests for Cost Savings
  Plans trigger approval mechanisms. To remediate, configure billing account settings
  to enforce an approval workflow, ensuring all cost-saving initiatives are vetted
  and authorized appropriately.
