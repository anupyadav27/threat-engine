title: Restrict Cost Export Destinations to Least Privilege
rationale: Implementing least privilege for cost export destinations reduces the risk
  of unauthorized access to sensitive billing data, which can lead to financial exposure
  and compliance violations. Ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted
  helps prevent data leaks and unauthorized financial insights, aligning with regulatory
  standards such as PCI-DSS and SOC2.
description: This rule checks whether cost export destinations in GCP Billing Accounts
  are configured with the least privilege principle. Specifically, it verifies that
  only necessary roles and permissions are assigned to users or service accounts accessing
  cost export destinations. To remediate, review IAM policies associated with billing
  accounts and adjust roles to ensure they have only the permissions needed for their
  function. Use the GCP Console or gcloud command-line tool to audit and modify IAM
  roles.
