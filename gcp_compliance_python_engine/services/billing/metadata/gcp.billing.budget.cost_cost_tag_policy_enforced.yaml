title: Enforce Cost Tag Policy on GCP Billing Budgets
rationale: Enforcing cost tag policies on billing budgets ensures that costs are accurately
  tracked and attributed to the appropriate projects or departments, which aids in
  financial management and accountability. Without this enforcement, there is a risk
  of cost misallocation, leading to budget overruns and potential financial loss.
  This practice also supports compliance with financial regulations and audit requirements
  by ensuring transparent and traceable spending.
description: This rule checks whether a cost tag policy is enforced on all GCP billing
  budgets to ensure that each expenditure is tagged appropriately. To verify, check
  the billing settings in the GCP Console to confirm that a cost tag policy is associated
  with each budget. To remediate, navigate to the Billing section of the GCP Console,
  create or edit a budget, and apply a cost tag policy to ensure all expenditures
  are categorized correctly. This configuration helps in maintaining strict budgetary
  controls and financial transparency.
