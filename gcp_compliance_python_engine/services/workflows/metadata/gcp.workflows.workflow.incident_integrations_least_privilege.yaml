title: Enforce Least Privilege for GCP Workflow Incident Integrations
rationale: Implementing least privilege for workflows in GCP ensures that only necessary
  permissions are granted, reducing the risk of unauthorized access which can lead
  to data breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance with regulatory standards
  such as PCI-DSS and SOC2. By controlling access, organizations can protect sensitive
  data and maintain trust with customers and partners.
description: This rule checks that GCP workflows interacting with incident management
  systems have the minimal set of permissions required. Verify that IAM roles are
  assigned based on the 'principle of least privilege', ensuring roles are specific
  to job functions. Remediation involves auditing permissions of workflows, removing
  excess privileges, and assigning roles that align with the exact tasks the workflow
  needs to perform.
