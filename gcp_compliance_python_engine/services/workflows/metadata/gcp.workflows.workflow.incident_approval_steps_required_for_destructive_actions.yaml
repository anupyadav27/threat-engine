title: Require Approval Steps for Destructive Workflow Actions
rationale: Implementing incident approval steps for destructive actions in workflows
  reduces the risk of unauthorized or accidental resource modifications that can lead
  to data loss or service disruption. This control helps to ensure that critical operations
  are vetted by multiple stakeholders, enhancing accountability and compliance with
  governance policies.
description: This rule checks if workflows involving destructive actions, such as
  data deletion or modification, include mandatory incident approval steps. Organizations
  should configure workflows to incorporate human intervention for approval before
  execution of potentially harmful operations. Remediation involves modifying the
  workflow to include conditional approval steps or using Google Cloud IAM to enforce
  stringent access controls.
