title: Ensure Health Check is Enabled for IBM Cloud Load Balancer Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling health checks on load balancer groups is critical for ensuring
  high availability and reliability of applications. Health checks allow the load
  balancer to monitor the health of backend resources and reroute traffic away from
  unhealthy instances, thereby minimizing downtime and maintaining optimal performance.
  This proactive approach helps businesses maintain service continuity and meet service-level
  agreements (SLAs).
description: This rule verifies that health checks are enabled for all IBM Cloud load
  balancer groups. Health checks are essential for assessing the operational status
  of backend resources by periodically sending requests to determine their health.
  By enabling health checks, organizations can automatically exclude non-responsive
  or faulted instances from the load balancing pool, thereby preventing potential
  service disruptions. This practice not only enhances the security posture by ensuring
  that only healthy resources handle traffic but also aids in compliance with industry
  standards that require robust monitoring and failover mechanisms.
