title: Ensure Load Balancer is Configured Across Multiple Availability Zones
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring a load balancer across multiple availability zones (AZs) enhances
  application resilience and uptime by distributing traffic and workloads across different
  physical locations. This setup mitigates the risk of a single point of failure and
  ensures continuity of service in the event of an AZ-level outage, thus safeguarding
  business operations and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether an IBM Cloud load balancer is deployed across
  multiple AZs, ensuring redundancy and high availability. By spreading resources
  across different geographical zones, this configuration reduces the risk of service
  disruption due to localized failures, such as hardware malfunctions or natural disasters.
  Compliance with this rule aligns with best practices for fault tolerance and supports
  adherence to regulatory requirements for critical infrastructure protection.
