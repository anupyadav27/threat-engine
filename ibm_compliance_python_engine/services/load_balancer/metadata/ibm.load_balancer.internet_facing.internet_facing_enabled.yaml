title: Ensure Internet-Facing Load Balancers are Appropriately Configured
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Internet-facing load balancers are critical for directing external traffic
  to internal resources. Proper configuration is essential to prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Ensuring these load balancers are securely configured
  minimizes exposure to external threats and supports compliance with security standards.
description: This rule verifies that internet-facing load balancers within IBM Cloud
  are correctly configured to manage traffic securely. It checks for the presence
  of security features such as SSL termination, access control lists, and logging
  to enhance the security posture. Proper configuration of these load balancers helps
  organizations mitigate risks associated with external network exposure, ensuring
  compliance with governance policies and improving the overall security monitoring
  of cloud environments.
