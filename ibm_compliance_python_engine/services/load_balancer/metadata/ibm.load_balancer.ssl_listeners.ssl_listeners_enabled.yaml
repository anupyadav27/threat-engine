rule_id: ibm.load_balancer.ssl_listeners.ssl_listeners_enabled
title: Ensure SSL Listeners are Enabled on IBM Cloud Load Balancers
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling SSL listeners on load balancers is crucial for encrypting data
  in transit, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and is protected
  from interception during transmission. This not only safeguards customer data but
  also helps organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, thereby avoiding potential legal ramifications and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks that SSL listeners are enabled on IBM Cloud load balancers,
  which ensures that all data passing through the load balancer is encrypted using
  SSL/TLS protocols. By enforcing SSL listeners, organizations can prevent unauthorized
  access and data breaches by securing the data exchange between clients and the server.
  Additionally, this enhances overall security posture and aligns with best practices
  for data protection and privacy, providing assurance to clients and stakeholders
  that robust security measures are in place.
