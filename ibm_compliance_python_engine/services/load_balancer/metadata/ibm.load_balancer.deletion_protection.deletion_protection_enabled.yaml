title: Enable Deletion Protection for IBM Cloud Load Balancers
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling deletion protection for load balancers is crucial to prevent accidental
  or malicious removal of these resources, which can lead to significant service disruptions
  and potential data loss. Maintaining the availability and integrity of load balancers
  ensures continuous traffic management and distribution, supporting business continuity
  and minimizing operational risk.
description: This rule verifies that deletion protection is enabled for IBM Cloud
  load balancers, a security measure that safeguards against inadvertent deletion.
  By implementing deletion protection, organizations can ensure that critical load
  balancing configurations remain intact, thereby maintaining the resilience of application
  deployments. This compliance measure not only fortifies infrastructure security
  but also aligns with governance practices by enforcing controlled access and change
  management over critical resources.
