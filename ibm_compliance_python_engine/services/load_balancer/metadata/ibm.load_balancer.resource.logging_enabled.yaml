rule_id: ibm.load_balancer.resource.logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Load Balancers
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for load balancers is essential for maintaining visibility
  into network traffic and detecting anomalous activities. This practice aids in forensic
  investigations following security incidents and helps in meeting compliance requirements
  for data security and auditing.
description: This security rule checks whether logging is enabled on IBM Cloud Load
  Balancer resources. By enabling logging, organizations can capture detailed records
  of network requests, which are crucial for monitoring traffic patterns, identifying
  potential threats, and conducting post-incident analysis. Enabling audit logging
  enhances the security posture by ensuring that all access and configuration changes
  are recorded, thus supporting compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
