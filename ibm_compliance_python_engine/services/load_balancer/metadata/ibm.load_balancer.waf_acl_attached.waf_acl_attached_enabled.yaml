title: Ensure WAF ACL is Attached and Enabled on IBM Cloud Load Balancers
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) on
  IBM Cloud Load Balancers is crucial for protecting web applications from common
  threats and vulnerabilities. By filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic, WAF ACLs
  help to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, thereby
  safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that a WAF ACL is properly attached and enabled on
  IBM Cloud Load Balancers. When this configuration is in place, it provides an additional
  layer of security by inspecting incoming traffic and applying predefined security
  rules to detect and block malicious activities. Enabling WAF ACLs is a critical
  step in meeting compliance standards and ensuring robust security monitoring, thereby
  enhancing the overall security posture of your cloud environment.
