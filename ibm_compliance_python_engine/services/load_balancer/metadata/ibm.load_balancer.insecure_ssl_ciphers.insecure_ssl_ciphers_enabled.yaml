title: Disable Insecure SSL Ciphers on IBM Cloud Load Balancers
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling insecure SSL ciphers on load balancers can expose sensitive data
  to interception and decryption by malicious actors. This compromises data integrity
  and confidentiality, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with
  industry standards like PCI DSS and GDPR. By disabling these ciphers, organizations
  can enhance their security posture and protect sensitive information.
description: This rule checks for the presence of insecure SSL ciphers enabled on
  IBM Cloud load balancers. Insecure ciphers are those that have known vulnerabilities
  or are considered weak due to their outdated cryptographic algorithms. By identifying
  and disabling these ciphers, organizations can prevent potential attacks such as
  man-in-the-middle (MITM) and downgrade attacks. This action not only strengthens
  the security of data in transit but also aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements
  related to data protection and privacy.
