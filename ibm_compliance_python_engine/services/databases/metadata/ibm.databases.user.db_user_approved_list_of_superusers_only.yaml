rule_id: ibm.databases.user.db_user_approved_list_of_superusers_only
title: Restrict Database Superuser Access to Approved List Only
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Limiting database superuser access to a predefined list of approved users
  is crucial for minimizing potential security risks. Unauthorized or excessive superuser
  access can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, and compliance
  violations, impacting business operations and reputation.
description: This rule ensures that only users included in an approved list are granted
  superuser privileges within IBM Cloud databases. By enforcing this restriction,
  organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  insider threats. It enhances security by ensuring that superuser roles are assigned
  based on need-to-know and need-to-do principles, thus supporting compliance with
  data protection regulations and internal security policies.
