title: Ensure Encryption of Database Cluster Snapshots for Enhanced Data Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting database cluster snapshots is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access, both in transit and at rest. Without encryption,
  these backups may be vulnerable to data breaches, potentially resulting in financial
  loss and reputational damage. Ensuring encrypted snapshots aligns with regulatory
  compliance requirements and strengthens the overall security posture of the organization.
description: This rule verifies that database cluster snapshots within IBM Cloud are
  encrypted, thereby ensuring that data is protected against unauthorized access and
  potential breaches. The encryption of snapshots at rest involves using industry-standard
  encryption algorithms to secure data, which is a fundamental aspect of data protection
  and privacy. Implementing this encryption enhances security by providing an additional
  layer of protection, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, and offering peace of mind that sensitive information is secure.
