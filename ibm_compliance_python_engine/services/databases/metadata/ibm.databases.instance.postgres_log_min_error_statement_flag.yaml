rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.postgres_log_min_error_statement_flag
title: Ensure Postgres Log Min Error Statement Flag is Configured
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring the Postgres Log Min Error Statement flag is vital for capturing
  and logging erroneous SQL statements, which aids in detecting and diagnosing potential
  security incidents. Proper logging helps maintain the integrity and availability
  of the database by enabling timely identification and resolution of issues, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and operational disruptions.
description: This rule checks whether the Log Min Error Statement flag is configured
  appropriately on PostgreSQL instances within IBM Cloud databases. By ensuring that
  this flag is set, database administrators can capture detailed logs of SQL statements
  that result in errors, enabling more effective auditing and monitoring. This enhances
  the security posture by facilitating the identification of anomalous activities
  and supporting compliance with auditing requirements, such as those outlined in
  SOC 2 and GDPR.
