rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.in_transit_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure In-Transit Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling in-transit encryption is crucial for protecting data as it traverses
  networks. Without encryption, sensitive information such as customer data, personal
  identifiers, and proprietary business data can be intercepted, leading to data breaches
  and compliance violations. This rule helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access
  during data transmission, thus safeguarding the organization's reputation and maintaining
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether in-transit encryption is enabled for database
  clusters within IBM Cloud. It ensures that data is encrypted while moving between
  the client and the database server using protocols like TLS. By mandating encryption
  in transit, this rule strengthens data protection and privacy, aligning with industry
  standards and regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Enforcing this security
  measure helps organizations achieve a robust security posture and protects against
  data interception threats.
