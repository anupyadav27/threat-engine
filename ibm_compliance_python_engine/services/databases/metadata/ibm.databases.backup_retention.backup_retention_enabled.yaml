rule_id: ibm.databases.backup_retention.backup_retention_enabled
title: Ensure Backup Retention is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling backup retention for databases is crucial for data recovery and
  business continuity. It safeguards against data loss due to accidental deletions,
  corruption, or cyberattacks, ensuring that critical business operations can continue
  with minimal disruption. Proper backup retention also supports compliance with industry
  regulations and standards by maintaining historical data integrity.
description: This rule checks that backup retention is configured and enabled for
  databases hosted on IBM Cloud. Backup retention ensures that copies of database
  states are periodically saved and can be restored in the event of data loss. By
  implementing backup retention, organizations enhance their security posture by mitigating
  the risk of prolonged downtime and data loss. Additionally, maintaining backups
  aids in meeting compliance requirements related to data archival and recovery, such
  as those mandated by GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks.
