title: Enforce Auto Minor Version Upgrade for Database Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling auto minor version upgrades ensures that databases remain up-to-date
  with the latest security patches and performance improvements. This proactive approach
  mitigates vulnerabilities associated with outdated software, reducing the risk of
  data breaches and ensuring compliance with industry standards. Regular updates also
  enhance system reliability and operational efficiency, positively impacting business
  continuity.
description: This rule checks whether the auto minor version upgrade feature is enabled
  for databases within IBM Cloud. By enforcing automatic updates, organizations can
  ensure that their databases receive critical security patches and enhancements without
  manual intervention. This practice aligns with best practices for data protection
  and privacy, as it minimizes the window of exposure to known vulnerabilities. Compliance
  with this rule helps organizations maintain robust security postures and adhere
  to regulatory requirements for data encryption and protection.
