rule_id: ibm.databases.whitelist.db_sg_only_required_ports_open
title: Ensure Only Required Ports Are Open for Database Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that only necessary ports are open in database security groups
  is crucial to minimize the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access. Open
  ports can be exploited by malicious actors to access sensitive data, leading to
  data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards. By restricting access
  to essential ports, organizations can enhance their data protection measures, maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of their database resources.
description: This rule checks that database security groups are configured to allow
  traffic only through ports that are essential for operation. By restricting open
  ports to those required for database functionality, this rule helps prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data exfiltration. Implementing this control aligns with best
  practices for data protection and supports compliance with data privacy regulations
  by ensuring that encryption and access controls are effectively enforced.
