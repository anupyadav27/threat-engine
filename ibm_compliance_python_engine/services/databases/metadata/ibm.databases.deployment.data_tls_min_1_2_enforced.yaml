rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.data_tls_min_1_2_enforced
title: Enforce Minimum TLS 1.2 for Secure Database Deployments
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher is crucial
  for protecting sensitive information from interception and tampering. This requirement
  mitigates the risk of data breaches and ensures compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, thereby maintaining customer trust and safeguarding business integrity.
description: This security rule mandates that all database deployments on IBM Cloud
  enforce a minimum of TLS 1.2 for data transmission. By verifying the use of TLS
  1.2, the rule enhances the security posture by ensuring robust encryption protocols
  that protect data from unauthorized access during transit. This practice aligns
  with compliance frameworks such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR, which require strong
  encryption standards to protect sensitive data. Adhering to this rule helps organizations
  prevent potential data exposure and fulfill regulatory obligations, ultimately reducing
  the risk of financial penalties and reputational damage.
