title: Ensure Automatic Failover is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases Clusters
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling automatic failover in database clusters is crucial for maintaining
  high availability and minimizing downtime in the event of a node failure. This feature
  ensures that database operations can continue uninterrupted, thereby protecting
  business operations and preserving data integrity. Additionally, it enhances customer
  trust by ensuring data is consistently accessible, aligning with business continuity
  and disaster recovery strategies.
description: This security rule checks whether automatic failover is enabled for database
  clusters within the IBM Cloud environment. Automatic failover is a critical configuration
  that allows seamless transition and continuity of services when a primary node fails,
  by promoting a standby node to become the new primary. Enabling this feature strengthens
  the resilience of the database infrastructure, reducing the risk of data loss and
  ensuring compliance with data protection standards by maintaining service availability
  even during hardware or software failures.
