rule_id: ibm.databases.user.data_warehouse_endpoint_authz_no_anonymous_access
title: Ensure No Anonymous Access to Data Warehouse Endpoints
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: This rule is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored
  within data warehouse services on IBM Cloud. Anonymous access can lead to data breaches,
  unauthorized data manipulation, and can compromise the integrity and confidentiality
  of business-critical information. By enforcing authenticated access, organizations
  can better protect their data assets and maintain compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that all data warehouse endpoints are configured to
  deny anonymous access, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can
  interact with the data. By implementing strict authentication measures, the rule
  enhances the security posture by preventing unauthorized data access and potential
  data leaks. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry standards and
  regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of sensitive data
  and the implementation of robust access controls.
