title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment for IBM Cloud Databases Instances
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment for database instances
  enhances data durability and availability by replicating data across multiple geographic
  zones. This configuration minimizes the risk of data loss due to a single point
  of failure and ensures business continuity, which is critical for maintaining operational
  integrity and meeting regulatory compliance.
description: The rule checks if IBM Cloud database instances are configured with Multi-AZ
  deployment, which involves replicating data across multiple availability zones to
  provide robust fault tolerance and disaster recovery capabilities. Enabling Multi-AZ
  ensures that your data remains available and secure even in the event of a zone
  failure, thereby protecting against data loss and downtime. This practice not only
  aligns with best security practices but also supports adherence to compliance standards
  that mandate high availability and data protection.
