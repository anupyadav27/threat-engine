title: Ensure Encrypted Cross-Region Backup for DB Cluster Snapshots
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for cross-region copies of DB cluster snapshots is
  crucial to protect sensitive data as it traverses different geographic locations.
  By securing these backups with encryption, organizations mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches during transit and storage. This practice not only enhances
  data privacy but also aids in compliance with industry regulations and standards.
description: This rule verifies that all cross-region copies of database cluster snapshots
  are encrypted to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality. The rule checks for
  the presence of encryption configurations in the backup settings of IBM Cloud databases.
  Implementing encryption for cross-region snapshot copies ensures that sensitive
  data remains protected against potential threats, such as interception or unauthorized
  access, during transfer. By enforcing this rule, organizations align with best practices
  for data protection, enhancing their overall security posture and achieving compliance
  with regulatory requirements related to encryption at rest and in transit.
