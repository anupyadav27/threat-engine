rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.backup_enabled
title: Ensure Backups are Enabled for IBM Cloud Database Instances
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling backups for IBM Cloud database instances is crucial for safeguarding
  data integrity and ensuring business continuity. Without regular backups, organizations
  risk data loss due to unforeseen events such as hardware failures, cyber-attacks,
  or accidental deletions, which can lead to significant financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks whether automatic backups are enabled for IBM Cloud
  database instances. Enabling backups ensures that data is regularly saved and can
  be restored in the event of data loss or corruption, enhancing the overall resilience
  of the data storage solution. Furthermore, maintaining regular backups is often
  a compliance requirement for various data protection standards, providing organizations
  with a foundation for meeting regulatory obligations and demonstrating due diligence
  in data management practices.
