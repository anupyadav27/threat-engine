title: Ensure SSL Connection is Enabled for Flexible Server Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling SSL connections for flexible server databases is crucial for safeguarding
  data in transit from unauthorized access and interception. This security measure
  ensures that sensitive information is encrypted while being transmitted between
  clients and databases, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining
  business trust.
description: This rule checks whether SSL connections are enabled for flexible server
  databases within IBM Cloud. By enforcing SSL, data transmitted over networks is
  encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering. This enhances the overall
  security posture of the database services and helps organizations comply with industry
  standards and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of
  personal and sensitive data during transmission.
