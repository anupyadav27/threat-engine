title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for IBM Cloud Databases Deployments
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for databases ensures that sensitive data is
  protected against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This measure
  helps in safeguarding business-critical information, enhancing customer trust, and
  complying with various regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS,
  which mandate stringent data protection protocols.
description: This security rule checks that all Platform as a Service (PaaS) database
  deployments on IBM Cloud have encryption at rest enabled. By encrypting data stored
  on disk, the rule prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data in case
  of physical theft or unintentional exposure. Implementing encryption at rest is
  a critical component of a comprehensive data protection strategy, ensuring compliance
  with industry standards and regulations while mitigating the risk of data breaches
  and financial penalties.
