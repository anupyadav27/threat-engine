rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.data_encrypted_at_rest_cmek
title: Ensure Database Backups Are Encrypted with Customer-Managed Keys
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting database backups using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
  ensures that sensitive data remains secure even when stored at rest. This approach
  not only enhances data security by giving customers control over their encryption
  keys but also facilitates compliance with various regulatory requirements, thus
  protecting the organization from potential data breaches and legal penalties.
description: This security rule checks whether backups of IBM Cloud databases are
  encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). By implementing
  CMEK, organizations retain control over the encryption keys used to secure their
  data, thereby enhancing the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in
  backups. This method of encryption aligns with industry best practices for data
  protection and supports compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring
  that data is protected against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
