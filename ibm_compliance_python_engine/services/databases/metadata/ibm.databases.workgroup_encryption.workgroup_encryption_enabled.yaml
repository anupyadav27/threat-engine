rule_id: ibm.databases.workgroup_encryption.workgroup_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Workgroup Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling workgroup encryption for databases in IBM Cloud is crucial for
  safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access. Encrypting data at rest
  ensures that even if physical storage is compromised, the data remains unreadable
  without the proper decryption keys. This measure is vital for maintaining data integrity,
  complying with regulatory requirements, and preserving customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that workgroup encryption is enabled for
  databases hosted on IBM Cloud. By enforcing encryption at the storage layer, it
  protects sensitive information from potential breaches or data leaks. Encrypting
  data at rest is a fundamental practice in data protection, aligning with industry
  standards and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Ensuring that workgroup
  encryption is consistently applied enhances the overall security posture and compliance
  readiness of your cloud environment.
