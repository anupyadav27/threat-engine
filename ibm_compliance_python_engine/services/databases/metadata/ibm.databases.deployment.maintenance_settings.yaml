title: Enforce Encryption for Database Maintenance Settings
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring encryption during maintenance operations for IBM Cloud databases
  is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. By enforcing
  encryption, organizations can mitigate risks associated with data breaches and ensure
  compliance with data protection regulations, thereby safeguarding business integrity
  and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud database deployments have encryption
  enabled for maintenance settings. It ensures that all data accessed, processed,
  or stored during maintenance activities is encrypted using robust encryption algorithms.
  By implementing this rule, organizations enhance their security posture by protecting
  data at rest and aligning with industry standards and compliance requirements such
  as GDPR and HIPAA. This proactive measure also prevents potential data exposure
  during routine maintenance operations, reducing the risk of data compromise.
