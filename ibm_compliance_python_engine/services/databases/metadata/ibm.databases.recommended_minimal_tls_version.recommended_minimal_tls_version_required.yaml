rule_id: ibm.databases.recommended_minimal_tls_version.recommended_minimal_tls_version_required
title: Enforce Minimal TLS Version for Database Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring a recommended minimal TLS version is essential for protecting
  database communications against vulnerabilities associated with older encryption
  protocols. Implementing this rule helps prevent unauthorized data access and mitigates
  risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, thereby safeguarding sensitive business
  information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the database instances in IBM Cloud enforce
  a recommended minimal TLS version for secure communications. By ensuring that only
  strong, up-to-date encryption protocols are used for data in transit, this rule
  enhances the security posture of your databases. Adhering to this practice not only
  aligns with industry best practices but also aids in compliance with various data
  protection regulations, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
