rule_id: ibm.databases.connection.data_access_private_only
title: Ensure Database Connections Use Private Networking Only
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing database connections to utilize private networks ensures that
  sensitive data is transmitted within a secure, controlled environment, minimizing
  exposure to the public internet. This practice helps protect against unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, which can have significant financial and reputational
  impacts on the business.
description: This rule checks whether database connections in IBM Cloud are configured
  to use only private networking for data access. By restricting connections to private
  networks, organizations can enhance their security posture by limiting exposure
  to external threats and ensuring that data remains within designated secure boundaries.
  This aligns with best practices for network security and supports compliance with
  regulatory standards that require robust data protection measures.
