title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment for IBM Cloud Databases Clusters
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ deployment for database clusters is crucial to enhance
  data availability and resilience against outages. By distributing database instances
  across multiple availability zones, businesses can minimize the risk of data loss
  and ensure continuity of operations, which is essential for maintaining customer
  trust and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud database clusters are configured with
  Multi-AZ deployments, which means that the database instances are distributed across
  different availability zones. Multi-AZ deployment improves the security posture
  by providing redundancy and failover capabilities, ensuring that data remains available
  even if one zone experiences an outage. Additionally, this setup supports compliance
  with data protection regulations that require high availability and disaster recovery
  strategies. Implementing Multi-AZ deployment aligns with best practices for data
  protection and contributes to a robust security framework.
