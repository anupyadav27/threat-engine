rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_instance_deletion_protection_enabled
title: Ensure Db Instance Deletion Protection is Enabled for Secure Data Retention
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling deletion protection for database instances is crucial to prevent
  accidental or malicious removal of critical data, which could result in significant
  business disruption and potential data loss. By securing these instances, organizations
  can maintain data integrity and ensure compliance with data protection regulations,
  minimizing the risk of financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that deletion protection is enabled for IBM Cloud
  database deployments, ensuring that instances cannot be inadvertently or intentionally
  deleted without proper authorization. Enabling this feature enhances the security
  of data at rest by adding an additional layer of protection against unauthorized
  access, thereby supporting compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. This proactive measure helps maintain data availability and integrity,
  crucial for business continuity and regulatory adherence.
