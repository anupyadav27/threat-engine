rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_cluster_audit_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Db Cluster Audit Logging is Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for database clusters is crucial for tracking access
  and modifications to data, helping to identify unauthorized activities and potential
  security breaches. This practice not only enhances the security posture by providing
  visibility into data interactions but also supports compliance with regulatory requirements,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and associated penalties.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for database deployments
  on IBM Cloud. Audit logging captures detailed records of data access and modifications,
  which are vital for forensic analysis and incident response. By maintaining comprehensive
  logs, organizations can quickly detect suspicious activities, investigate security
  incidents, and meet compliance standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Enabling
  audit logging ensures that an organization has the necessary audit trails to safeguard
  sensitive information and adhere to regulatory mandates.
