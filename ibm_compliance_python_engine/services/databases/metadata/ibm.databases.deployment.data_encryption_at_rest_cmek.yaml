title: Enforce CMEK for Data Encryption at Rest in IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data encryption
  at rest is crucial for maintaining control over sensitive data and meeting compliance
  requirements. It ensures that organizations have the ability to manage and rotate
  encryption keys, thereby enhancing data security and reducing the risk of unauthorized
  data access, which could lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud database deployments utilize Customer
  Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting data at rest. By leveraging CMEK,
  organizations maintain full control over the encryption keys used to secure their
  data, allowing for periodic key rotation and revocation. This practice not only
  strengthens data protection by providing customizable encryption management but
  also aids in compliance with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular
  checks ensure that all database instances adhere to this security standard, thereby
  safeguarding sensitive data against potential breaches.
