rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.copy_tags_to_snapshots_enabled
title: Ensure Tags are Copied to Database Snapshots for Enhanced Traceability
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling the copying of tags to database snapshots ensures that metadata
  related to data ownership, environment, and compliance is preserved across backups.
  This practice enhances traceability and accountability, aiding in efficient data
  management and compliance reporting. It simplifies the process of identifying and
  managing snapshots, reducing the risk of mismanagement or data loss.
description: This rule verifies that tags assigned to IBM Cloud database clusters
  are consistently copied to their respective snapshots. By maintaining metadata across
  snapshots, organizations can ensure continuity in data classification and compliance
  with internal policies and external regulations. This capability facilitates efficient
  data lifecycle management and strengthens governance by providing clear visibility
  into the origin and purpose of data assets. Enabling this feature also supports
  disaster recovery and auditing processes, ensuring that snapshots can be easily
  identified and managed according to their tagging information.
