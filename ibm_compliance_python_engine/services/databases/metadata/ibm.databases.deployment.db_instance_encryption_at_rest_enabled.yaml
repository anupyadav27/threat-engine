title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for IBM Cloud Database Deployments
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for database instances is essential to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that
  any data stored on disk is encrypted, thereby providing a critical layer of security
  that helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity. This measure is particularly
  significant for meeting regulatory and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection standards.
description: This security rule verifies that all database instances deployed within
  the IBM Cloud environment have encryption at rest enabled. It checks the configuration
  settings of each database deployment to ensure that data stored in the database
  is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data exposure in the
  event of unauthorized access or physical theft of storage media. Additionally, this
  practice aligns with global compliance frameworks, providing assurance to stakeholders
  that sensitive data is being handled with the utmost security standards.
