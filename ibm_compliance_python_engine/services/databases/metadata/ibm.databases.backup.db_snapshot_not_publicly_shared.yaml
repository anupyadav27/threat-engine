rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.db_snapshot_not_publicly_shared
title: Ensure Database Snapshots Are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Preventing public access to database snapshots is crucial to maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity. Publicly shared snapshots can expose sensitive
  data, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring snapshots are not publicly accessible mitigates
  these risks and protects organizational data assets.
description: This rule checks that database snapshots within IBM Cloud are not publicly
  shared, ensuring that only authorized users have access. By restricting public access,
  it safeguards sensitive data from unauthorized viewing or manipulation. Implementing
  this rule enhances the overall security posture by aligning with best practices
  for data protection and compliance frameworks. It also reduces the attack surface
  by limiting potential exposure points in cloud storage environments.
