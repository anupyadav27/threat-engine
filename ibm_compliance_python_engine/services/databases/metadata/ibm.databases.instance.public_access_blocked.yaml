rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.public_access_blocked
title: Enforce No Public Access to IBM Cloud Database Instances
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to database instances is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible databases are vulnerable
  to attacks, which can lead to data exposure and compliance violations. Ensuring
  database instances are not publicly accessible mitigates these risks and helps maintain
  the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.
description: This rule ensures that IBM Cloud database instances are configured to
  block any public access, safeguarding them from unauthorized external threats. The
  check verifies that no database instance is exposed to the public internet by reviewing
  network access settings and compliance with access control policies. Enforcing this
  rule enhances security by limiting access to pre-approved users and systems, thereby
  aligning with industry-standard compliance frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA.
