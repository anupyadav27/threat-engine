rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.data_audit_logging_enabled
title: Ensuring Data Audit Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling data audit logging for IBM Cloud databases is crucial for maintaining
  accountability and traceability of database transactions. It allows organizations
  to detect unauthorized access or anomalies, thereby enhancing data security and
  compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Without audit logs,
  businesses could face significant risks, including data breaches and non-compliance
  fines.
description: This rule checks whether data audit logging is enabled for database deployments
  in IBM Cloud. By ensuring audit logging is active, organizations can maintain a
  detailed record of all database transactions, which is vital for forensic analysis
  and incident response. This practice not only strengthens the security posture by
  providing visibility into database activities but also supports compliance with
  various legal and regulatory requirements by demonstrating rigorous data governance.
