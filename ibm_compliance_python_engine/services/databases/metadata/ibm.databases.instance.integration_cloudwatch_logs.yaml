title: Ensure Database Instances Integrate with Cloudwatch Logs
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Integrating database instances with Cloudwatch Logs is crucial for effective
  monitoring and auditing of database activities. It helps in quickly identifying
  anomalous behaviors and potential security threats, thus minimizing downtime and
  safeguarding data integrity. Additionally, it supports compliance with regulatory
  standards by maintaining comprehensive audit trails.
description: This rule verifies that all database instances within IBM Cloud are configured
  to integrate with Cloudwatch Logs. The integration facilitates the centralized collection,
  storage, and analysis of log data, enhancing the visibility of database operations.
  By enabling this logging mechanism, organizations can detect unauthorized access
  attempts, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain a secure environment. Furthermore,
  it aligns with compliance requirements by ensuring that all database activities
  are recorded and available for audit purposes.
