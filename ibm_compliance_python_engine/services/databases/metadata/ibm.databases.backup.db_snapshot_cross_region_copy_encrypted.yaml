rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.db_snapshot_cross_region_copy_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for Cross-Region Db Snapshot Copies
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting database snapshot copies during cross-region transfers is critical
  to safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential exposure
  during transit. This practice not only ensures compliance with data protection regulations
  but also mitigates the risk of data breaches, thereby maintaining customer trust
  and preserving business integrity.
description: This rule ensures that all database snapshot copies transferred across
  regions are encrypted. It checks for the presence of encryption configurations on
  cross-region snapshot backups, thereby enhancing the security of data at rest and
  in transit. By enforcing encryption, organizations align with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures. This proactive
  approach to data security helps prevent unauthorized data access and ensures that
  sensitive information remains confidential and secure.
