rule_id: ibm.databases.user.db_user_no_unused_or_default_superusers
title: Ensure No Unused or Default Superuser Accounts in Databases
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Unused or default superuser accounts in databases pose significant security
  risks, as they are often targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. By ensuring
  these accounts are either removed or properly managed, organizations reduce the
  potential attack surface and mitigate the risk of data breaches, thereby protecting
  sensitive information and maintaining compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks for the presence of unused or default superuser accounts
  in IBM Cloud databases, ensuring they are either removed or properly secured. Superuser
  accounts with excessive privileges can be exploited if left unmanaged, leading to
  unauthorized data access and potential system compromise. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations enhance their security posture by minimizing privileged access, thereby
  aligning with best practices for identity and access management and supporting compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
