rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.data_admin_access_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Admin Access in IBM Cloud Databases
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that data admin access operates under the principle of least privilege
  is crucial in minimizing the risk of unauthorized data exposure or modification.
  By restricting permissions to only those necessary for specific roles, organizations
  can better protect sensitive data, reduce potential attack surfaces, and maintain
  compliance with industry regulations and standards.
description: This rule verifies that data admin roles within IBM Cloud databases are
  configured to follow the least privilege principle, ensuring that users have only
  the necessary permissions required for their tasks. By doing so, it helps to mitigate
  the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to data. Implementing least
  privilege access enhances security posture by ensuring adherence to compliance requirements,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby protecting sensitive information from potential
  breaches.
