rule_id: ibm.databases.account.use_private_endpoints
title: Enforce Private Endpoints for IBM Databases Network Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Utilizing private endpoints for database access significantly enhances
  security by restricting exposure to the public internet, thereby reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access and data breaches. This practice ensures that data communication
  remains within a secure, controlled environment, which is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks that IBM Cloud databases are configured to use private
  endpoints for network access, ensuring that database connections occur over a secure,
  internal network rather than the public internet. Implementing private endpoints
  minimizes the attack surface and mitigates potential threats by leveraging IBM Cloud's
  secure network infrastructure. Compliance with this rule aids in adhering to regulatory
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures.
