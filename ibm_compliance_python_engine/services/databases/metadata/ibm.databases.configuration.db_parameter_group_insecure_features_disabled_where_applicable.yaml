rule_id: ibm.databases.configuration.db_parameter_group_insecure_features_disabled_where_applicable
title: Enforce Secure Database Parameter Configurations to Mitigate Risks
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Disabling insecure features in database parameter groups is crucial for
  reducing potential attack surfaces and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive
  data. By ensuring that only secure features are enabled, organizations can safeguard
  data integrity and maintain trust with stakeholders while also avoiding potential
  regulatory fines and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that database configurations adhere to best practices
  by disabling insecure features within parameter groups where applicable. By enforcing
  secure parameter settings, databases are protected against vulnerabilities that
  could be exploited by malicious entities. This enhances data protection by ensuring
  encryption at rest is effectively implemented, aligning with compliance standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular monitoring and adherence to this rule help maintain
  a robust security posture and promote data privacy.
