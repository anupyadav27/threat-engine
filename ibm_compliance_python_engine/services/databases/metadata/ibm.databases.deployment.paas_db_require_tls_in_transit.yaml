title: Ensure TLS for In-Transit Data Encryption in IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data in transit using TLS is crucial to protect sensitive information
  from interception and unauthorized access during transmission. This rule helps safeguard
  database communications, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing TLS not only enhances
  data confidentiality and integrity but also builds customer trust by demonstrating
  a commitment to robust security practices.
description: This rule verifies that all platform-as-a-service (PaaS) database deployments
  on IBM Cloud utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encrypting data in transit.
  By enforcing TLS, the rule ensures that data exchanges between clients and databases
  are secure, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Compliance with
  this rule also aids organizations in meeting industry-specific security requirements
  and certifications, contributing to a comprehensive data protection strategy.
