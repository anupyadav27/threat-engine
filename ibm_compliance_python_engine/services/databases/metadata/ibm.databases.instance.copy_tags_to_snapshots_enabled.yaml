rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.copy_tags_to_snapshots_enabled
title: Ensure Tags Are Copied to Database Snapshots
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling the copying of tags to database snapshots is crucial for maintaining
  metadata consistency and ensuring efficient resource tracking and management. Tags
  facilitate better organization and cost allocation, which is essential for operational
  efficiency, compliance audits, and resource lifecycle management.
description: This security rule checks if the configuration to copy tags from database
  instances to their snapshots is enabled. By ensuring tags are copied, you maintain
  consistent metadata across your database resources and their backups, which aids
  in data management, security assessments, and compliance reporting. This practice
  enhances your ability to monitor and manage resources effectively, improving traceability
  and accountability across your cloud environment. It also supports compliance with
  data governance standards by ensuring that metadata associated with snapshots is
  preserved and consistent.
