rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.vpc_deployment_required
title: Enforce VPC Deployment for IBM Cloud Databases Instances
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Deploying IBM Cloud Databases within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ensures
  that sensitive data is isolated and protected from unauthorized access, leveraging
  the inherent security features of VPCs. This configuration supports compliance with
  data protection regulations by providing a secure and controlled environment, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and associated business impacts.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud Databases instances are deployed within
  a VPC, which is crucial for enforcing network isolation and enhanced security controls.
  VPC deployment restricts external access, allowing only trusted connections through
  private networking. This practice not only fortifies the data against unauthorized
  access but also enables organizations to meet stringent encryption at rest requirements
  by integrating with IBM Cloud's security services. Adhering to this rule helps maintain
  compliance with industry standards and regulations, thereby safeguarding sensitive
  data and maintaining customer trust.
