title: Enforce Enhanced VPC Routing for Secure IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enhanced VPC Routing is crucial for securing data traffic within IBM Cloud
  databases by ensuring that all data flows through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
  This reduces exposure to potential threats and unauthorized access, thereby protecting
  sensitive data. Implementing this routing enhances data privacy, aligns with compliance
  mandates, and mitigates the risk of data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Enhanced VPC Routing is enabled for IBM Cloud
  database clusters, ensuring that data transmission occurs exclusively within the
  secure confines of a VPC. By routing all database traffic through a VPC, this configuration
  minimizes exposure to the public internet, thereby reducing risks associated with
  data interception and unauthorized access. Enforcing Enhanced VPC Routing not only
  strengthens the security posture of database environments but also aids in achieving
  compliance with data protection standards by ensuring data is encrypted at rest
  and in transit.
