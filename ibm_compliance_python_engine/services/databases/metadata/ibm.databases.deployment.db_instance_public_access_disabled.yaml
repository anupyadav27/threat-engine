rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_instance_public_access_disabled
title: Ensure IBM Cloud Database Instances Have Public Access Disabled
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling public access to database instances is crucial for preventing
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By restricting access to only trusted
  networks and users, organizations can mitigate the risk of exposure to malicious
  actors, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud database instances are configured with
  public access disabled. By doing so, it ensures that the database is not accessible
  from the internet, reducing the attack surface and safeguarding data integrity and
  confidentiality. Implementing this control aids in compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, such as GDPR and PCI DSS, which require stringent access controls
  to protect personal and financial information.
