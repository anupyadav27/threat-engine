rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.postgres_log_min_messages_flag
title: Configure Postgres Log Min Messages for Enhanced Audit Logging
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Proper configuration of the Postgres Log Min Messages setting is crucial
  for effective auditing and monitoring of database activities. It ensures that the
  appropriate level of detail is recorded in logs, aiding in the detection of anomalous
  behaviors and troubleshooting issues. This configuration enhances accountability
  and can prevent unauthorized changes, thereby safeguarding data integrity and supporting
  compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that the Postgres Log Min Messages setting is configured
  to an appropriate level to capture necessary logging details. By adjusting the log_min_messages
  parameter, administrators can control the verbosity of logs generated by the PostgreSQL
  database engine. Setting this parameter to an optimal level ensures that significant
  events are logged without overwhelming the logging system with excessive information.
  Proper logging facilitates efficient auditing, aids in forensic analysis, and aligns
  with best practices for regulatory compliance, such as GDPR or PCI DSS, by ensuring
  traceability of database operations.
