rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.public_access_blocked
title: Enforce Public Access Restrictions on IBM Cloud Databases Deployments
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to database deployments is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Ensuring that databases are
  not publicly accessible reduces the attack surface, thereby preventing exploitation
  by malicious actors. This measure helps maintain the integrity, confidentiality,
  and availability of critical business data and aligns with regulatory compliance
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that public access to IBM Cloud database deployments
  is restricted, ensuring that only authorized users and applications within the private
  network can connect. By enforcing this configuration, organizations mitigate the
  risk of unauthorized data exposure and comply with data protection standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this rule enhances the overall security posture
  by minimizing vulnerabilities associated with open public endpoints, thereby contributing
  to a robust security framework.
