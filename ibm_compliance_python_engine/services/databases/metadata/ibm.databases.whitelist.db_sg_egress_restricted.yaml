title: Enforce Egress Restriction on Database Security Group Whitelisting
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting egress traffic in database security groups is crucial for minimizing
  unauthorized data exfiltration risks. It ensures that only approved, secure channels
  are used for data communication, thereby protecting sensitive data from potential
  breaches and reducing the attack surface.
description: This rule checks for egress restrictions in security groups associated
  with IBM Cloud databases, ensuring that only predefined, secure networks are whitelisted.
  By enforcing these egress controls, organizations can prevent unauthorized data
  flow, aligning with best practices for data protection and privacy. This measure
  enhances the security posture by controlling data movement, thereby aiding in compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data access and
  transfer controls.
