title: Restrict Inbound Access to IBM Cloud Databases for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Unrestricted inbound access to databases poses a significant security risk,
  as it exposes sensitive data to unauthorized access and potential breaches. Implementing
  strict access controls helps protect against malicious activities, ensuring the
  confidentiality and integrity of data while maintaining compliance with industry
  regulations.
description: This rule ensures that inbound access to IBM Cloud databases is restricted
  to authorized sources only, preventing potential threats from exploiting open network
  ports. By evaluating and blocking any unrestricted inbound access, the rule enhances
  the security posture of the database environment. This proactive measure not only
  fortifies the database against unauthorized access but also aids in compliance with
  best practices and standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, contributing to
  a robust security framework.
