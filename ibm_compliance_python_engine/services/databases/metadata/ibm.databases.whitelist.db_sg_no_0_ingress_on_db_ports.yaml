rule_id: ibm.databases.whitelist.db_sg_no_0_ingress_on_db_ports
title: Restrict Ingress Traffic on Database Ports to Authorized IPs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that database ports are not open to the internet is critical in
  safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access. By restricting ingress traffic
  to only trusted IP addresses, organizations can significantly mitigate the risk
  of data breaches and ensure compliance with data protection regulations, safeguarding
  both business reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule checks that database security groups do not allow unrestricted
  ingress traffic on database ports, ensuring that only whitelisted IP addresses can
  establish connections. By enforcing strict ingress controls, this rule helps prevent
  unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration. Implementing this rule aligns
  with best practices for data protection and privacy, promoting robust encryption
  at rest strategies and supporting compliance with industry standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
