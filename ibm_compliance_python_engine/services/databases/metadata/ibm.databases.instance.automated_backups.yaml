title: Enforce Automated Backups for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Automated backups are crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability
  in IBM Cloud databases. By ensuring regular backups, organizations can protect against
  data loss due to accidental deletion, corruption, or cyber-attacks. This practice
  not only supports business continuity but also aligns with compliance requirements
  for data protection.
description: This rule checks whether automated backups are enabled for IBM Cloud
  database instances, ensuring that data is regularly and systematically backed up.
  Automated backups improve security by providing a reliable method for data recovery
  in the event of data loss incidents. Enabling this feature supports compliance with
  data protection standards and regulations, as it ensures that critical data is not
  only stored securely but also recoverable in case of unforeseen events.
