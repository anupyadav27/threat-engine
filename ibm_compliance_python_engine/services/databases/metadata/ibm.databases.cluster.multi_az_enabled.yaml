title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment for IBM Cloud Databases Clusters
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment for database clusters
  is crucial for enhancing data resilience and availability. It ensures that data
  is replicated across multiple zones, reducing the risk of data loss and downtime
  in the event of a failure in a single zone, which can have significant business
  impacts.
description: This rule checks if IBM Cloud database clusters are configured for Multi-AZ
  deployments. Multi-AZ deployment improves the security posture by providing data
  redundancy and high availability, which is critical for maintaining business continuity
  during zone failures or maintenance events. Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance
  requirements related to data protection and privacy by ensuring that data remains
  accessible and secure across geographically dispersed locations. Implementing this
  configuration aligns with best practices for disaster recovery and operational resilience.
