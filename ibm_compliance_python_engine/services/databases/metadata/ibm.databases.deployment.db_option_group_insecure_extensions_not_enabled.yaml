rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_option_group_insecure_extensions_not_enabled
title: Ensure Insecure Extensions Are Disabled in Database Option Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Disabling insecure extensions in database option groups is crucial to maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of data stored within IBM Cloud databases. Insecure
  extensions can introduce vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious actors,
  leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring these extensions
  are disabled helps protect sensitive information and aligns with best practices
  for data protection and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks that any database deployments on IBM Cloud do not have
  insecure or deprecated extensions enabled within their option groups. By auditing
  and enforcing the exclusion of these extensions, the security posture of the database
  environment is strengthened, reducing the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities.
  This practice not only enhances data protection by ensuring encryption at rest is
  not undermined but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations
  regarding data privacy and security.
