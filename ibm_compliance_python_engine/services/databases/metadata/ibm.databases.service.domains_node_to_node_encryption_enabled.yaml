title: Ensure Node-to-Node Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling node-to-node encryption for IBM Cloud databases is critical in
  safeguarding sensitive data as it traverses between database nodes. This security
  measure ensures that data remains confidential and protected from interception,
  which is vital for maintaining customer trust and meeting stringent regulatory requirements.
  Failure to implement this can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and significant
  financial and reputational damage.
description: This security rule verifies that node-to-node encryption is enabled across
  databases within the IBM Cloud environment. It ensures that all data moving between
  nodes is encrypted, thus protecting the data in transit from potential eavesdropping
  or interception by malicious actors. By implementing this encryption, organizations
  not only enhance their security posture but also align with data protection standards
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others, ensuring compliance with industry regulations and
  reducing the risk of data exposure.
