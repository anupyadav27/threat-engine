title: Enforce Strong Passwords for IBM Cloud Database Users
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing strong password policies for database users is crucial to
  protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. Weak or default passwords can
  be easily exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches and potential financial
  and reputational damage. Strengthening password requirements helps ensure that only
  authorized users can access the database, thereby enhancing overall security.
description: This rule checks that database user passwords adhere to strong security
  policies where supported, requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and
  special characters. By enforcing complex passwords, it reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access through brute force or guessing attacks. This practice not only bolsters
  security but also aids in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  mandate stringent access control measures. Regularly updating and enforcing strong
  passwords is a fundamental security measure to protect sensitive data within IBM
  Cloud databases.
