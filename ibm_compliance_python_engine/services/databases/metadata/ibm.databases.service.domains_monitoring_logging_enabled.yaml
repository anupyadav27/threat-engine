rule_id: ibm.databases.service.domains_monitoring_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Domains Monitoring Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling domains monitoring logging for IBM Cloud databases is crucial
  for maintaining a robust security posture. This practice allows for the continuous
  tracking and recording of database interactions, aiding in the quick detection of
  unauthorized access attempts and potential data breaches. Moreover, it supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements for data security and auditability, minimizing
  the risk of financial penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that domains monitoring logging is activated for all
  database services within IBM Cloud. By enabling this feature, organizations can
  capture detailed logs of database activities, including access patterns and data
  modifications. This enhances security by providing visibility into potentially suspicious
  activities, facilitating forensic analysis, and ensuring adherence to compliance
  standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS. Implementing such logging mechanisms strengthens
  the overall security framework, helping to safeguard sensitive data against compromise.
