title: Ensure Domains Cloudwatch Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Cloudwatch Logging for IBM Cloud Databases is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture. It allows for real-time monitoring and auditing of database
  operations, helping to detect unauthorized access or anomalies. This capability
  is essential for meeting compliance requirements and protecting sensitive data from
  potential breaches.
description: This rule verifies that Cloudwatch Logging is enabled for IBM Cloud databases,
  ensuring that all access and activity logs are captured and retained. By enabling
  logging, organizations can gain visibility into database usage patterns and detect
  suspicious activities promptly. This practice not only strengthens security but
  also aids in forensic analysis and compliance with regulatory mandates such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which require detailed audit trails.
