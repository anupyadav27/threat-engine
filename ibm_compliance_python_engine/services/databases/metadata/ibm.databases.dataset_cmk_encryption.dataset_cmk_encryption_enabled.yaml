title: Ensure Dataset CMK Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Customer Managed Key (CMK) encryption for datasets within IBM
  Cloud databases is crucial to maintain data confidentiality and integrity. It allows
  enterprises to manage encryption keys, thereby enhancing control over data security
  and ensuring that sensitive data is protected against unauthorized access. This
  is especially important in meeting regulatory requirements and safeguarding business-critical
  information.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud databases utilize Customer Managed
  Keys (CMK) for encryption at rest. By enabling CMK encryption, organizations can
  ensure that their data is encrypted using keys that they control, offering enhanced
  security compared to provider-managed keys. This practice strengthens data protection,
  aligns with compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, and mitigates risks associated
  with data breaches. Regular checks for CMK encryption help maintain a robust security
  posture by ensuring that all databases adhere to best practices for encryption.
