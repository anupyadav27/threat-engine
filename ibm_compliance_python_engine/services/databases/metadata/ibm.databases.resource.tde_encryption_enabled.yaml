rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.tde_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure TDE Encryption is Enabled for Databases on IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is crucial for safeguarding
  sensitive data stored in databases by encrypting the data at rest. This measure
  protects against unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thereby ensuring
  compliance with industry regulations and enhancing overall data security posture.
description: This rule verifies that Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is enabled
  for databases hosted on IBM Cloud. By enforcing TDE, all data within the database
  is encrypted automatically and transparently, ensuring that data is protected without
  requiring changes to applications. This practice not only fortifies the security
  of stored data but also aids in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA
  by ensuring that data is encrypted at rest, thus reducing the risk of data exposure
  due to hardware theft or unauthorized access.
