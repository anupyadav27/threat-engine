rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.data_not_publicly_shared
title: Ensure Backups of Database Data Are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Protecting database backups from public access is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  data exposure, which can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational
  damage. By ensuring that backups are not publicly accessible, organizations can
  maintain data confidentiality and integrity, complying with industry standards and
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule assesses the accessibility settings of database backups within
  IBM Cloud, ensuring that they are not publicly shared. It checks for configurations
  that might inadvertently expose backup data to unauthorized users over the internet.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by safeguarding
  sensitive information, reducing the risk of data breaches, and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Proper adherence to this
  rule ensures that only authorized personnel have access to backup data, providing
  a critical layer of security for sensitive information.
