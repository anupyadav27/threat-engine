rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_cluster_deletion_protection_enabled
title: Ensure Db Cluster Deletion Protection is Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling deletion protection for database clusters is crucial to prevent
  accidental or malicious removal of critical data resources. Protecting these clusters
  not only secures sensitive information but also ensures business continuity by safeguarding
  against data loss that could result in significant operational and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks whether deletion protection is enabled for database
  clusters within IBM Cloud. By activating deletion protection, organizations can
  prevent unauthorized or unintended deletions of database clusters, thereby maintaining
  data integrity and availability. Enforcing this configuration also aligns with best
  practices in data protection and regulatory compliance, as it ensures that critical
  data is preserved and protected against accidental or malicious actions.
