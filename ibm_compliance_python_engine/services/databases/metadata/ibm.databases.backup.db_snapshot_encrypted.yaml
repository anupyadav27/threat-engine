rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.db_snapshot_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of IBM Cloud Database Snapshot Backups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting database snapshot backups is crucial to protect sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Unencrypted backups are vulnerable
  to data theft, which can lead to compliance violations, financial losses, and damage
  to an organization's reputation.
description: This rule checks that all database snapshot backups within IBM Cloud
  databases are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Encryption
  at rest ensures that data is protected while stored, reducing the risk of data exposure
  in the event of unauthorized access or physical theft of storage media. Implementing
  this security measure aligns with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, helping
  organizations maintain compliance with data protection laws.
