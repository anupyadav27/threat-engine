title: Ensure 90-Day Retention of Database Audit Logs
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling a 90-day retention period for auditing database activities is
  crucial for detecting, investigating, and responding to unauthorized access or suspicious
  activities. It ensures that historical audit data is available for compliance with
  regulatory requirements and internal policies, minimizing potential legal and financial
  repercussions.
description: This rule checks whether database auditing logs are retained for at least
  90 days, ensuring that a comprehensive record of database interactions is maintained.
  By enabling this retention period, organizations can effectively track and analyze
  user activities and database changes over time, aiding in forensic investigations
  and compliance audits. This practice aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  frameworks, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the preservation of audit trails
  for security and accountability.
