rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_cluster_minor_version_auto_upgrade_enabled
title: Ensure Auto Upgrade for Db Cluster Minor Version is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Keeping database clusters updated with the latest minor version releases
  is crucial for maintaining security and operational efficiency. Minor version upgrades
  often include important security patches and performance enhancements that protect
  against vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry standards. Failure to
  enable auto-upgrades could expose databases to security risks and compliance violations,
  potentially leading to data breaches and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether the auto-upgrade feature for minor versions
  is enabled in IBM Cloud database deployments. Enabling automatic minor version upgrades
  ensures that your database clusters receive the latest security patches and feature
  improvements without manual intervention. This proactive approach not only enhances
  the security posture of your deployments by mitigating known vulnerabilities but
  also aids in maintaining compliance with data protection regulations. By automating
  these upgrades, organizations can reduce the risk of human error and ensure consistent
  application of updates across their database environments.
