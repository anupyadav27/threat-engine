rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.postgres_log_connections_flag
title: Ensure PostgreSQL Log Connections Flag is Enabled for Audit Logging
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling the log connections flag in PostgreSQL is crucial for maintaining
  an audit trail of database access. This logging capability helps in detecting unauthorized
  access attempts, understanding user behavior, and ensuring accountability. It also
  supports compliance with regulatory standards that mandate detailed logs of database
  interactions.
description: This rule checks whether the PostgreSQL log connections flag is enabled
  for database instances within IBM Cloud. When activated, this setting logs every
  successful or failed connection attempt to the database, providing valuable insights
  into access patterns and potential security threats. By ensuring this flag is enabled,
  organizations can enhance their security posture by maintaining comprehensive audit
  logs, which are essential for incident response and meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS.
