rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.default_admin_ibm_databases_instance_default_admin
title: Ensure Default Admin Credentials Are Not Used in IBM Databases Instances
severity: critical
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Default administrator credentials in IBM Databases instances pose a significant
  security risk, as they are well-known and can be easily exploited by unauthorized
  users. Compromising the default admin account can lead to unauthorized access, data
  breaches, and potential loss of sensitive business information, undermining data
  protection and privacy efforts.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Databases deployments are using their default
  admin credentials, which significantly increases vulnerability to unauthorized access.
  By enforcing the change of default admin credentials, organizations can enhance
  the security of their databases by reducing the risk of brute-force attacks and
  unauthorized access. This practice not only aligns with data protection and privacy
  standards but also aids in achieving compliance with industry regulations that mandate
  strong access controls and encryption measures.
