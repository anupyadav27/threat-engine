rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.db_cluster_snapshot_not_publicly_shared
title: Ensure Database Cluster Snapshots Are Not Publicly Shared
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Publicly shared database cluster snapshots can expose sensitive data, leading
  to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. This rule is critical for maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity, ensuring that sensitive information stored in
  database snapshots is protected from external threats. Non-compliance can result
  in significant business impacts, including financial losses, reputational damage,
  and legal liabilities due to data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks the configuration of database backup snapshots to ensure
  they are not publicly shared, which could inadvertently expose sensitive data. By
  enforcing private access to these snapshots, organizations can significantly reduce
  the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks. Implementing this rule enhances
  security by ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and restore database
  backups, thereby maintaining compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
