rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_option_group_only_approved_extensions_enabled
title: Enforce Approved Extensions in IBM Cloud Database Option Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing only approved extensions in database option groups is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and compliant database environment. Unauthorized extensions
  can introduce vulnerabilities, compromise data integrity, and lead to non-compliance
  with data protection regulations. This rule helps mitigate security risks by ensuring
  that only vetted and necessary extensions are deployed, thereby safeguarding sensitive
  data and maintaining business trust.
description: This security rule verifies that all extensions enabled within IBM Cloud
  database option groups are pre-approved by the organization's security policies.
  By restricting the use of extensions to only those that have been evaluated and
  deemed secure, the rule reduces the attack surface and prevents potential exploitation
  through malicious or vulnerable extensions. Implementing such controls aligns with
  best practices for data protection and privacy, particularly regarding encryption
  at rest, and supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
