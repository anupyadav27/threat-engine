rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.replication_task_source_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Replication Task Source Logging is Enabled for Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling replication task source logging is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of database activities. It allows organizations to detect unauthorized
  access or configuration changes, thereby safeguarding against potential data breaches.
  This practice not only supports regulatory compliance but also enhances the organization's
  ability to respond to incidents promptly.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for replication tasks associated
  with databases in IBM Cloud. Enabling logging ensures that all activities related
  to data replication are recorded, providing visibility into who accessed or modified
  replication configurations. This visibility is essential for detecting anomalies
  and analyzing incidents, thereby strengthening the security posture. Moreover, it
  aids in meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data
  protection and accountability.
