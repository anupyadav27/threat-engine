rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.db_cluster_snapshot_cross_account_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of DB Cluster Snapshots
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of database cluster snapshots is crucial
  for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. Uncontrolled sharing can lead
  to unauthorized access, exposing sensitive data to external threats, and potentially
  violating compliance requirements. Ensuring that only authorized accounts have access
  to these snapshots minimizes the risk of data breaches and aligns with best practices
  for data protection.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow database cluster snapshots
  to be shared across different IBM Cloud accounts. By restricting cross-account sharing,
  organizations can ensure that sensitive data contained in these snapshots is not
  inadvertently exposed to unauthorized parties. This control enhances security by
  reducing the attack surface and provides compliance benefits by aligning with industry
  standards that mandate strict data access controls. Implementing this rule helps
  organizations maintain a robust security posture, ensuring that only vetted and
  approved accounts can access backup data.
