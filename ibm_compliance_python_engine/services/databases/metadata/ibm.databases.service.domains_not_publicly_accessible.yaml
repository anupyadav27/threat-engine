rule_id: ibm.databases.service.domains_not_publicly_accessible
title: Ensure Database Service Domains Are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Preventing public access to database service domains is critical for safeguarding
  sensitive data from unauthorized exposure. Publicly accessible domains can serve
  as entry points for malicious actors, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
  violations. By restricting public access, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of their data assets.
description: This rule verifies that database service domains within IBM Cloud are
  configured to prevent public access, ensuring that only authorized users with appropriate
  credentials can access the database. By implementing this rule, organizations enhance
  their security posture by minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  access attempts. Moreover, this practice supports compliance with data protection
  regulations and industry standards by ensuring that sensitive data remains secure
  and private.
