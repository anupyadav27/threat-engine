title: Enforce Performance Insights for Enhanced Database Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Performance Insights on database instances is crucial for ensuring
  that database activities and performance metrics are continuously monitored and
  analyzed. This capability helps identify anomalies and potential security threats
  early, thereby mitigating risks. It also supports compliance with data protection
  and privacy regulations by ensuring that sensitive data access patterns are scrutinized
  and managed effectively.
description: This security rule verifies that Performance Insights is enabled for
  database instances within IBM Cloud. By enabling this feature, organizations gain
  visibility into resource utilization and query execution plans, which are instrumental
  in identifying performance bottlenecks and suspicious activities. This proactive
  approach not only enhances the security posture by detecting and responding to threats
  swiftly but also aids in maintaining compliance with industry standards such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data protection measures.
