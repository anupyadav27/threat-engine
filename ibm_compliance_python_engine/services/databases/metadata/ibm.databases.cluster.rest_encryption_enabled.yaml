rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.rest_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases Clusters
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for IBM Cloud databases clusters is crucial
  to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This
  measure not only safeguards the integrity and confidentiality of data but also helps
  organizations comply with regulatory requirements, thereby avoiding costly fines
  and reputational damage.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for IBM
  Cloud databases clusters. By encrypting data stored on disk, this rule ensures that
  sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access, even if the physical
  storage media is compromised. This practice enhances overall data security and assists
  organizations in meeting various industry standards and regulatory compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
