rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.replication_task_target_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Replication Task Target Logging is Enabled for IBM Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for replication tasks in IBM Databases is crucial for
  tracking data synchronization activities and identifying potential anomalies or
  unauthorized access attempts. It enhances the ability to audit and monitor data
  replication processes, thereby minimizing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for replication task targets
  within IBM Databases, ensuring that all replication activities are recorded. By
  capturing detailed logs, organizations can analyze replication activities, detect
  irregularities, and swiftly respond to incidents. This practice not only strengthens
  data integrity and security but also aids in meeting compliance mandates such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent audit logging.
