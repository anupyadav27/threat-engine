title: Enforce TLS for Secure In-Transit Database Communications
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing TLS for database communications is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and interception during transmission. This requirement
  helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity, thereby reducing the risk of
  data breaches and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks that all database instances deployed on IBM Cloud have
  TLS enabled for in-transit encryption. By requiring TLS, data transmitted between
  the database and clients is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Compliance with this rule aids in meeting data protection regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring that sensitive data is secured during transmission
  between systems.
