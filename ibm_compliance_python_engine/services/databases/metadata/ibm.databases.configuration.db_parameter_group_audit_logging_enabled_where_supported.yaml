title: Ensure Database Audit Logging is Enabled Where Supported
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for databases is crucial for monitoring and identifying
  unauthorized access or anomalies in database activities. It helps organizations
  comply with regulatory requirements and enhances the overall security posture by
  providing detailed logs that can be used for forensic analysis in the event of a
  security incident.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for IBM Cloud databases
  where the feature is supported. By ensuring audit logging is active, organizations
  can track access and modifications to sensitive data, providing an essential layer
  of security and accountability. Enabling audit logging aids in achieving compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, by maintaining a comprehensive
  record of database transactions and access patterns.
