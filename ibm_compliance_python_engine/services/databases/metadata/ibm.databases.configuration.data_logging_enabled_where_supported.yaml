rule_id: ibm.databases.configuration.data_logging_enabled_where_supported
title: Ensure Data Logging is Enabled for Supported IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling data logging in databases is crucial for tracking access and modifications
  to critical data, which aids in detecting unauthorized activities and potential
  security breaches. It provides a forensic trail that is essential for compliance
  with industry standards and regulations, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that data logging is enabled for databases within
  the IBM Cloud where such functionality is supported. By ensuring that logging is
  active, organizations can monitor database activities, helping to identify and respond
  to suspicious behaviors promptly. This improves security posture by enhancing visibility
  into database operations and supports compliance with regulations like GDPR and
  PCI DSS, which mandate logging of access and changes to data. The rule assesses
  the configuration settings of database services and flags any instances where logging
  is not enabled, ensuring consistent security practices across the cloud environment.
