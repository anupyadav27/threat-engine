title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Warehouse Endpoint Authorization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) following the least privilege
  principle is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
  data within IBM Cloud databases. By ensuring users have only the necessary permissions,
  organizations can significantly reduce the potential for data breaches and unauthorized
  data manipulations, thereby protecting business integrity and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that data warehouse user authorizations within IBM
  Cloud are configured according to the least privilege model using RBAC. It ensures
  that each user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role,
  thereby reducing the attack surface and potential for privilege escalation. Maintaining
  this stringent access control aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, supporting both security and regulatory objectives by safeguarding sensitive
  information and ensuring robust identity and access management practices.
