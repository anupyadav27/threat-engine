title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment for Enhanced Database Resilience
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment is crucial for maintaining high
  availability and resilience of database services in IBM Cloud. By distributing database
  instances across multiple zones, the risk of data loss due to a single zone failure
  is significantly reduced. This approach not only enhances data protection and continuity
  but also supports compliance with stringent data privacy and disaster recovery regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that databases deployed on IBM Cloud are
  configured to utilize a Multi-AZ setup, ensuring that data and operations are distributed
  across multiple availability zones. By leveraging Multi-AZ deployments, businesses
  can mitigate risks associated with zone-specific outages, thereby enhancing the
  reliability and uptime of their database services. Implementing such a configuration
  aligns with best practices in data protection, offering improved fault tolerance
  and adherence to compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
