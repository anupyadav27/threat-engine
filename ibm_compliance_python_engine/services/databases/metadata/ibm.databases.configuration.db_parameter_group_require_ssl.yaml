title: Enforce SSL for Database Parameter Group to Enhance Data Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing SSL for database connections is crucial to protect sensitive
  data in transit from interception and unauthorized access. Without SSL, data packets
  are transmitted in plaintext, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. Ensuring SSL usage mitigates these risks, safeguarding data integrity and
  privacy, which is essential for maintaining customer trust and complying with data
  protection regulations.
description: This rule checks if the database parameter group has SSL enforced for
  all client connections, ensuring that data exchanged between the database and client
  applications is encrypted. By mandating SSL, the rule enhances security by preventing
  unauthorized access and data breaches during transmission. Implementing this control
  aligns with best practices for data security and compliance standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which require encryption of data in transit to protect against data leaks
  and unauthorized disclosures.
