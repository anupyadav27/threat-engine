rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.storage_encrypted
title: Ensure Database Cluster Storage is Encrypted at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting storage at rest is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data against
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It ensures that even if physical
  storage media is compromised, the data remains protected. This not only helps in
  maintaining customer trust but also supports compliance with various data protection
  regulations.
description: This rule checks if the storage within IBM Cloud database clusters is
  encrypted at rest, which involves ensuring that all data stored in the cluster is
  automatically transformed using robust encryption algorithms. Implementing encryption
  at rest mitigates the risk of data exposure in case of unauthorized access to physical
  storage devices. It aligns with best practices for data protection and complies
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby helping organizations meet
  regulatory requirements and enhance their overall security posture.
