rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.public_access_blocked
title: Enforce Blocked Public Access for IBM Cloud Database Clusters
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to database clusters is critical to prevent unauthorized
  external access, which can lead to data breaches and loss of sensitive information.
  Ensuring that database clusters are not exposed to the public internet protects
  against potential threats and aligns with best practices for data security and compliance.
description: This rule checks that database clusters within IBM Cloud environments
  are configured to block public access, thereby restricting access to only internal
  networks or specific IP addresses. By enforcing this configuration, organizations
  can significantly reduce the attack surface, preventing unauthorized access to critical
  data assets. This measure also aids in compliance with industry standards such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access controls to protect sensitive data.
