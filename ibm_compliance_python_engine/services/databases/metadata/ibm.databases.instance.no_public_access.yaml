rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.no_public_access
title: Enforce No Public Access for IBM Cloud Database Instances
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Restricting public access to database instances is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible databases are vulnerable
  to attacks such as SQL injection, brute force, and data exfiltration, which can
  lead to significant financial loss and reputational damage.
description: This rule ensures that IBM Cloud database instances are not configured
  with public accessibility, thereby enforcing strict network boundaries. It checks
  the network settings of the database instances to confirm they are not exposed to
  the public internet. By implementing this rule, organizations enhance their security
  posture by minimizing attack surfaces, aligning with industry best practices, and
  maintaining compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
