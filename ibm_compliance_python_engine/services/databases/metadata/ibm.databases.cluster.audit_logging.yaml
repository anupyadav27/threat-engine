rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.audit_logging
title: Enforce Audit Logging for IBM Cloud Databases Clusters
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Audit logging is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of
  database clusters within IBM Cloud. By capturing detailed logs of access and activity,
  organizations can detect unauthorized access attempts, ensure accountability, and
  adhere to compliance requirements. Failure to implement audit logging can result
  in undetected security breaches and non-compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for all database clusters
  on IBM Cloud, ensuring that every operation, including data access and administrative
  actions, is recorded. Enabling audit logging enhances security by providing a detailed
  trail of activity that can be used for forensic analysis and threat detection. It
  also supports compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require thorough
  audit capabilities to protect sensitive data. The rule checks for the presence of
  audit logs and assesses their configuration to ensure comprehensive coverage and
  reliability.
