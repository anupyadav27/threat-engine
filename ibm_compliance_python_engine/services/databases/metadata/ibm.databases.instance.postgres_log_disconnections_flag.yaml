rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.postgres_log_disconnections_flag
title: Enforce Postgres Log Disconnections for Enhanced Audit Logging
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling the Postgres Log Disconnections flag ensures that all disconnection
  activities from the PostgreSQL database are logged. This enhances the audit trail,
  helping organizations detect unauthorized access patterns and diagnose connection-related
  issues. By maintaining a comprehensive log, businesses can improve their forensic
  analysis and comply with regulatory requirements for data access monitoring.
description: This rule verifies that the Postgres Log Disconnections flag is enabled
  on IBM Cloud database instances. By logging disconnections, organizations can gain
  visibility into user activity and identify potential security incidents. This practice
  not only aids in monitoring user behavior but also strengthens compliance with auditing
  standards by ensuring that all database disconnection events are recorded. Enabling
  this flag helps mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and enhances
  the overall security posture of the database environment.
