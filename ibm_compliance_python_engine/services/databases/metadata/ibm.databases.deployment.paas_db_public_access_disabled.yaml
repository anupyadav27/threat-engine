rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.paas_db_public_access_disabled
title: Disable Public Access to IBM Cloud PaaS Databases for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Cloud PaaS databases do not have public access is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized exposure and potential breaches.
  Publicly accessible databases are at a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attackers,
  which can lead to data theft, loss of customer trust, and significant financial
  repercussions for businesses.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud PaaS database deployments are configured
  with public access disabled, thereby restricting access to only authorized internal
  networks and users. By implementing this security measure, organizations can significantly
  reduce the attack surface and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. It enhances
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  strict controls over data accessibility. This rule is a critical component of a
  robust identity and access management strategy, ensuring that sensitive data is
  protected against potential external threats.
