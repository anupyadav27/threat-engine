title: Restrict Data Access CIDRs for Enhanced Database Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Minimizing the range of CIDR blocks allowed to access databases significantly
  reduces the potential attack surface and mitigates unauthorized access risks. This
  practice is crucial for protecting sensitive data, ensuring that only trusted networks
  can initiate database connections, which in turn supports organizational compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This security rule evaluates the CIDR blocks specified in the connection
  settings for IBM Cloud databases to ensure they are minimized, allowing access only
  from necessary and trusted IP ranges. By restricting these CIDRs, the rule helps
  prevent unauthorized network access, thus enhancing the overall security posture
  of the database environment. Implementing this rule supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulations by ensuring that access is granted based on the principle
  of least privilege, thereby reducing the likelihood of data breaches.
