title: Enforce Internal User Database for Enhanced Domain Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling the internal user database for domains ensures that user management
  is handled within a secure environment, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  This measure is crucial for maintaining data integrity and protecting sensitive
  information stored in databases, thereby minimizing potential business disruptions
  and compliance violations.
description: This rule verifies that internal user databases are configured for domains
  within IBM Cloud Databases, ensuring that authentication and user management are
  handled securely. By enforcing this setting, organizations can centralize access
  control, streamline user authentication, and enhance the overall security posture
  of their cloud environments. Implementing this rule helps in maintaining compliance
  with industry standards and regulations by ensuring robust identity and access management
  practices are in place, thereby safeguarding critical data assets.
