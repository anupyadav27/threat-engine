rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.postgres_log_statement_flag
title: Enforce Logging of SQL Statements in IBM Cloud PostgreSQL Instances
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling the logging of SQL statements in PostgreSQL databases is crucial
  for security and compliance. It helps in auditing database activities, identifying
  potential security breaches, and troubleshooting operational issues. Without proper
  logging, organizations may face challenges in detecting unauthorized access or data
  manipulation, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule checks whether the 'log_statement' flag is enabled for PostgreSQL
  instances on IBM Cloud. By logging SQL statements, organizations can maintain a
  comprehensive audit trail of database interactions, which is essential for both
  security monitoring and compliance purposes. This feature allows administrators
  to monitor all executed SQL commands, providing insights into user actions and helping
  detect suspicious activities. Additionally, it supports adherence to compliance
  frameworks such as GDPR and PCI DSS, which require robust logging and monitoring
  practices.
