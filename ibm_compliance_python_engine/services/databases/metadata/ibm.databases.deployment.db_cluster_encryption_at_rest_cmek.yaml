title: Db Cluster Encryption at Rest using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting database clusters at rest using Customer Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) ensures that sensitive data is protected against unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. This practice not only enhances data privacy and integrity
  but also provides organizations with greater control over their encryption keys,
  thereby aligning with stringent compliance requirements and reducing the risk of
  insider threats.
description: This rule checks whether database clusters deployed on IBM Cloud are
  configured to utilize Customer Managed Encryption Keys for encryption at rest. By
  leveraging CMEK, organizations can maintain exclusive control over the encryption
  keys used to protect their data, ensuring that they can enforce key rotation, revocation,
  and audits as necessary. This enhances the security posture by protecting data from
  unauthorized access even in the event of a security breach. Moreover, it aids in
  meeting compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate robust
  encryption practices to safeguard sensitive information.
