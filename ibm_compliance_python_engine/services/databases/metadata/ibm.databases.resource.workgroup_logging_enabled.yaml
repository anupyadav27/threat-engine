rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.workgroup_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Workgroup Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling workgroup logging is essential for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of database activities, which aids in detecting unauthorized access
  and anomalies. It enhances visibility into user actions and database operations,
  thereby supporting both security incident investigations and compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that workgroup logging is enabled for IBM Cloud databases,
  ensuring that all significant actions and changes are recorded. By capturing detailed
  logs of database activities, organizations can enhance their security posture by
  quickly identifying and responding to potential threats. Furthermore, maintaining
  comprehensive logs helps in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and
  PCI DSS, by providing evidence of data access and modifications.
