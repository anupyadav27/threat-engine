rule_id: ibm.databases.configuration.data_require_ssl
title: Enforce SSL for Data Encryption in IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing SSL for database connections is crucial for protecting data in
  transit from eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access.
  By mandating SSL, organizations ensure that sensitive information remains confidential
  and integrity is maintained, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether SSL is required for all connections to IBM Cloud
  databases, ensuring that data is encrypted during transmission. By configuring databases
  to mandate SSL, organizations can protect sensitive data against interception and
  unauthorized access while it travels across networks. Implementing SSL encryption
  not only strengthens the security posture but also aids in achieving compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data protection
  mechanisms.
