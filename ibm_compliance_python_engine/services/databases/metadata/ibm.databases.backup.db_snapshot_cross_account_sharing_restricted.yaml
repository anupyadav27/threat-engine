rule_id: ibm.databases.backup.db_snapshot_cross_account_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Database Backup Snapshots
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of database backup snapshots is crucial
  to maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. Allowing unrestricted access
  to database snapshots across accounts can lead to unauthorized data exposure, potentially
  resulting in data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
  By enforcing restrictions, organizations can better safeguard sensitive information
  and ensure that only authorized users have access to critical data resources.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow database backup snapshots
  to be shared across different IBM Cloud accounts. By restricting this capability,
  the rule helps prevent unauthorized access and potential data leaks. It ensures
  that backup snapshots are only accessible within the intended account, thereby reducing
  the risk of data exposure. Implementing this rule aids in achieving compliance with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements by enforcing strict access control
  policies for data storage and backup management.
