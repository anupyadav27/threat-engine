title: Enforce Minimum TLS 1.2 for IBM Cloud Flexible Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for database connections is crucial
  to protect data in transit against interception and tampering. TLS 1.2 provides
  enhanced security features and mitigates vulnerabilities found in earlier versions,
  ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations. This protection is
  vital for maintaining customer trust and safeguarding sensitive business data.
description: This security rule verifies that all IBM Cloud Flexible Server databases
  enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for communications. By ensuring that TLS 1.2
  is the baseline, the rule enhances the security posture of database interactions
  by utilizing strong encryption protocols. This measure not only defends against
  various attack vectors, such as man-in-the-middle and downgrade attacks, but also
  aligns with compliance requirements like GDPR and PCI DSS, which mandate robust
  data protection mechanisms.
