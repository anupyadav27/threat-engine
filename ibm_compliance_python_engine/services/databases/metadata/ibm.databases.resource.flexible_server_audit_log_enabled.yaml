rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.flexible_server_audit_log_enabled
title: Ensure Flexible Server Audit Logs are Enabled for IBM Databases
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logs for flexible servers is crucial for tracking access
  and modifications to database environments. This practice helps to detect unauthorized
  actions and maintain accountability, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring
  adherence to regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. By maintaining comprehensive
  logs, organizations can enhance their ability to respond to security incidents and
  demonstrate compliance during audits.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for flexible server
  database resources on the IBM Cloud. Audit logging captures detailed records of
  database operations, including user activities and system changes, which are essential
  for monitoring and forensic analysis. By enabling audit logs, organizations can
  enhance their security posture by gaining visibility into potential threats and
  unauthorized activities. This practice supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, ensuring that security measures are in place to protect sensitive
  data.
