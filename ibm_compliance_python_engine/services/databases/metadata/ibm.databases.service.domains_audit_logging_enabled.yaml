title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases Services
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for IBM Cloud databases services is crucial for
  maintaining a robust security posture. It provides visibility into access and modification
  activities, helping to detect unauthorized actions and potential security breaches.
  This proactive monitoring helps organizations meet compliance requirements and protect
  sensitive data from misuse or theft.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for all databases services
  within the IBM Cloud environment. Audit logging captures detailed records of user
  activities and changes to configurations, which are essential for forensic analysis
  and compliance audits. By ensuring that audit logging is active, organizations can
  enhance their capability to detect and respond to suspicious activities, thereby
  strengthening their security framework and aligning with industry standards for
  data protection.
