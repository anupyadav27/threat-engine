rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.postgres_log_min_duration_statement_flag
title: Ensure Postgres Log Min Duration Statement is Configured
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring the Postgres Log Min Duration Statement is crucial for tracking
  slow queries that could indicate performance bottlenecks or potential security risks.
  It enables database administrators to identify and optimize inefficient queries,
  ensuring better resource utilization and improved application performance. Additionally,
  capturing long-running queries can help in forensic investigations and compliance
  with data security standards.
description: This rule checks whether the 'log_min_duration_statement' parameter is
  set for PostgreSQL instances within IBM Cloud Databases. By setting this parameter,
  you enable logging of SQL statements that exceed a specified duration, allowing
  for detailed monitoring and analysis of query performance. This practice enhances
  security by providing visibility into potentially harmful or inefficient queries
  and aids in maintaining compliance with audit logging requirements. Proper configuration
  of this logging parameter helps meet enterprise security policies and regulatory
  standards by ensuring that suspicious database activities are recorded and available
  for review.
