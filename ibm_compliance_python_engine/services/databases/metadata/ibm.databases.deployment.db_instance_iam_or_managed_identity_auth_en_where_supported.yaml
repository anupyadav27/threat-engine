title: Enforce IAM or Managed Identity Authentication for Database Instances
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing IAM or Managed Identity authentication for database instances
  is crucial to ensure that only authorized users and services can access sensitive
  data. This approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized access by leveraging robust
  identity management controls. Implementing this rule helps in maintaining data integrity,
  protecting against data breaches, and complying with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks if database instances are configured to use IBM Cloud
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) or Managed Identity authentication methods
  where supported. By enabling these authentication mechanisms, database access is
  tightly controlled and monitored, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized
  identities can interact with the data. This enhances security by reducing the attack
  surface and helps organizations meet compliance requirements by ensuring that access
  controls are properly enforced and auditable.
