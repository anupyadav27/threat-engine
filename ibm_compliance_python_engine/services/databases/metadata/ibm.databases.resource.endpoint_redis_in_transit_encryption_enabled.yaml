title: Ensure Redis In-Transit Encryption is Enabled for Enhanced Data Security
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling in-transit encryption for Redis endpoints is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from interception during transmission. Without encryption, data can
  be exposed to unauthorized access and potential breaches, jeopardizing data privacy
  and violating compliance requirements. Ensuring encryption helps maintain customer
  trust and meets regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that in-transit encryption is enabled for Redis endpoints
  within IBM Cloud databases. It checks configurations to ensure that data moving
  between clients and servers is encrypted using TLS protocols. By enforcing encryption,
  this rule enhances data confidentiality and integrity, reducing the risk of data
  interception. It also aligns with various compliance frameworks that mandate data
  protection measures, thereby aiding organizations in achieving regulatory compliance
  and safeguarding their business reputation.
