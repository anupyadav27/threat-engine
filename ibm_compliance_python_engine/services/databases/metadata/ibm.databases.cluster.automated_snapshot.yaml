title: Enforce Automated Snapshots for Database Clusters
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Ensuring that automated snapshots are enabled for database clusters is
  crucial for data protection and disaster recovery. This practice helps mitigate
  data loss risks due to hardware failures, human errors, or malicious attacks, thus
  maintaining business continuity and safeguarding sensitive information.
description: This rule checks whether automated snapshots are enabled for IBM Cloud
  database clusters, which ensures that data is backed up regularly and consistently.
  Automated snapshots facilitate quick recovery in case of data breaches or failures,
  enhancing the overall security posture of the database environment. By adhering
  to this rule, organizations can better align with industry standards and compliance
  frameworks that mandate regular data backups and retention policies, thereby reducing
  potential legal and financial liabilities.
