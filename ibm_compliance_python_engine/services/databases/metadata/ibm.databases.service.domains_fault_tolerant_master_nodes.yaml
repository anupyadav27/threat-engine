title: Ensuring Fault Tolerance for Master Nodes in IBM Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing fault-tolerant master nodes is crucial for maintaining high
  availability and data integrity in database services. This requirement minimizes
  the risk of data loss and service disruption due to hardware failures or maintenance
  activities, thereby enhancing business continuity and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the master nodes for IBM Cloud databases are
  configured with fault tolerance. Fault-tolerant configurations ensure that data
  is consistently available and protected against single points of failure by distributing
  the workload across multiple nodes. This setup not only bolsters data protection
  but also aligns with compliance standards that mandate high availability and resilience
  of critical data systems.
