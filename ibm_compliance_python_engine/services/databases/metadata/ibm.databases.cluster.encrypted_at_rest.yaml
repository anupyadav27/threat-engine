rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.encrypted_at_rest
title: Ensure IBM Cloud Databases Clusters Are Encrypted At Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that even if physical
  storage media is compromised, the data remains unintelligible without the proper
  decryption keys. This safeguarding measure is essential for maintaining customer
  trust and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks if encryption at rest is enabled for IBM Cloud databases
  clusters, ensuring that all stored data is automatically encrypted using industry-standard
  encryption algorithms. By enforcing this security measure, organizations can significantly
  reduce the risk of data exposure and enhance their overall security posture. Complying
  with encryption at rest requirements not only fulfills data protection mandates
  but also aligns with best practices for data privacy, supporting adherence to regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
