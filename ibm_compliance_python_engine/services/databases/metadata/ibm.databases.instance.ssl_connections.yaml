rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.ssl_connections
title: Enforce SSL Connections for IBM Cloud Databases Instances
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing SSL connections for database instances is crucial to protect
  data in transit from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that all data communicated between the database and its clients is encrypted, organizations
  can maintain data integrity and confidentiality, thereby adhering to industry standards
  and regulatory requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that IBM Cloud database instances are configured
  to enforce SSL connections, ensuring that data transmitted between clients and the
  database is encrypted. By enabling SSL/TLS, data is protected from eavesdropping
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, thus enhancing the overall security posture. Additionally,
  this practice supports compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR and
  PCI-DSS, which mandate encryption of sensitive data in transit.
