rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.db_subnet_group_private_subnets_only
title: Ensure Database Deployments Use Private Subnets Only
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing the use of private subnets for database deployments enhances
  security by restricting exposure to public networks, thereby reducing the risk of
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice aligns with industry
  best practices and compliance requirements, ensuring that sensitive data is confined
  within secure network boundaries.
description: This rule checks that IBM Cloud database deployments are configured to
  use only private subnets within their subnet groups. By doing so, organizations
  can ensure that their database instances are isolated from public internet access,
  significantly reducing the attack surface. Implementing this rule not only strengthens
  the security posture but also aids in achieving compliance with data protection
  regulations, as databases are kept within a controlled network environment, minimizing
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
