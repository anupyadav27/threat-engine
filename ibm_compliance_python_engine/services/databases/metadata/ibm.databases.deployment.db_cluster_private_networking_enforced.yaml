title: Enforce Private Networking for IBM Cloud Database Clusters
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that database clusters are only accessible through private networking
  is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. By restricting
  network traffic to private channels, organizations can significantly reduce the
  attack surface and prevent potential breaches. This approach also aligns with industry
  best practices for safeguarding data integrity and privacy, thereby enhancing customer
  trust and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: The rule checks whether private networking is enforced for IBM Cloud
  database clusters, which ensures that these clusters are not accessible via the
  public internet. By mandating private network configurations, this security measure
  mitigates the risks of exposure to external threats and unauthorized data access.
  Implementing this rule helps maintain a robust security posture by adhering to compliance
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data protection mechanisms
  for sensitive information.
