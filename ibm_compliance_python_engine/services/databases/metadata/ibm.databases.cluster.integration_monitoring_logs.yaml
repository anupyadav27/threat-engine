title: Ensure Integration Monitoring Logs for IBM Databases Clusters
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring logs are crucial for detecting and investigating security incidents.
  Without proper logging, identifying unauthorized access or anomalies within database
  clusters becomes challenging, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance
  with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that integration monitoring logs are enabled for IBM
  database clusters. It ensures that all activities, including access and changes
  to the databases, are recorded and available for review. This practice enhances
  security by enabling organizations to detect and respond to suspicious activities
  promptly. Additionally, it supports compliance with industry regulations that mandate
  logging and auditing of database activities, thereby reducing the risk of penalties
  and reputational damage.
