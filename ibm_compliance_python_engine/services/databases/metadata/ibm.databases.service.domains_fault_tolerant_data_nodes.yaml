title: Ensure Fault Tolerant Data Nodes for Database Services
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing fault-tolerant data nodes in IBM Cloud databases is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and availability in the event of hardware failures
  or network disruptions. This practice not only safeguards against data loss but
  also ensures continuous business operations, thereby minimizing potential financial
  losses and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud database services deploy fault-tolerant
  data nodes, which are essential in creating a resilient data infrastructure. By
  distributing data across multiple nodes, this configuration minimizes the risk of
  data unavailability due to node failures. It enhances security by ensuring data
  is always available and protected against single points of failure. Additionally,
  this setup supports compliance with data protection regulations by providing robust
  data redundancy and ensuring encryption at rest, thereby mitigating risks associated
  with data breaches and enhancing overall security posture.
