rule_id: ibm.databases.account.firewall_use_selected_networks
title: Ensure Firewall Configured to Allow Only Selected Networks
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing network access control by restricting firewall configurations
  to allow only selected networks is crucial in safeguarding databases from unauthorized
  access. This practice minimizes the attack surface area, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and potential financial losses. It also ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulatory requirements, enhancing the organization's overall security
  posture.
description: This rule verifies that firewall settings for IBM Cloud databases are
  configured to permit access exclusively from selected, trusted networks. By enforcing
  this configuration, unauthorized entities are prevented from accessing sensitive
  data, thereby bolstering the security of database services. Adhering to this rule
  aligns with best practices in network security, supporting compliance with regulatory
  frameworks such as GDPR and PCI DSS, and ensuring that only authorized users can
  interact with database resources.
