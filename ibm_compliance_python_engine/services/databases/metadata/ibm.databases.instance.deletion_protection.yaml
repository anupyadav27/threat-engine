rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.deletion_protection
title: Enable Deletion Protection for IBM Cloud Database Instances
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling deletion protection for database instances is crucial to prevent
  accidental or malicious deletion, which can lead to data loss, operational disruptions,
  and financial losses. This safeguard ensures that data integrity and availability
  are maintained, aligning with organizational data protection and privacy policies.
description: This rule checks whether deletion protection is enabled for IBM Cloud
  database instances. Deletion protection acts as a preventive control that restricts
  unauthorized or unintentional deletion of critical data assets. By enforcing this
  security measure, organizations can enhance their data protection strategy, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such
  as GDPR and CCPA. This practice not only boosts data security but also provides
  operational resilience and business continuity.
