title: Ensure Table CMK Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Customer Master Key (CMK) encryption for database tables is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It
  provides a layer of security that ensures data remains confidential and secure,
  even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the storage infrastructure. This
  measure is vital for compliance with data protection regulations, which mandate
  encryption of sensitive data at rest.
description: This rule checks whether Customer Master Key (CMK) encryption is enabled
  for database tables within IBM Cloud. CMK encryption allows customers to manage
  and control their own encryption keys, providing enhanced data protection by ensuring
  that data remains encrypted at rest. Enabling CMK encryption helps mitigate risks
  associated with data exposure and aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this rule ensures a robust security
  posture for databases by leveraging advanced encryption techniques to safeguard
  critical data assets.
