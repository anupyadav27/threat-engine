rule_id: ibm.databases.instance.public_ip
title: Restrict Public IP Access for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Allowing public IP access to database instances significantly increases
  the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential exploitation by attackers.
  By restricting public IP access, organizations can ensure that only trusted entities
  within a controlled network can interact with sensitive databases, thereby safeguarding
  critical data assets and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule evaluates IBM Cloud database instances to ensure they do not
  have public IP addresses assigned, thus preventing direct access from the internet.
  By enforcing this control, organizations enhance the security of their database
  environments by minimizing exposure to external threats. Implementing this rule
  helps meet compliance requirements for data protection and access control standards,
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS, by ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible through
  secure, private network channels.
