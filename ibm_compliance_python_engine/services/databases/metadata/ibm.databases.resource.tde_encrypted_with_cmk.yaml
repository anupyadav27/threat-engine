rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.tde_encrypted_with_cmk
title: Ensure Databases Use TDE with Customer-Managed Keys
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)
  enhances data security by allowing organizations to maintain control over encryption
  keys. This approach mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and aligns with
  regulatory requirements for data protection, helping businesses avoid potential
  legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that databases on IBM Cloud are configured to use
  Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK). By leveraging
  CMKs, organizations can manage and rotate their encryption keys independently, ensuring
  that data at rest is encrypted under their control. This configuration enhances
  security by preventing unauthorized access and providing a robust mechanism for
  data privacy. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry standards
  and regulatory mandates regarding encryption, such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.
