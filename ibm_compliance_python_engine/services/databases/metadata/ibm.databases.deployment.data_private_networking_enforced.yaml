rule_id: ibm.databases.deployment.data_private_networking_enforced
title: Enforce Private Networking for Database Deployments
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that database deployments are confined to private networks is
  critical for safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. By enforcing data private networking, organizations can reduce the attack
  surface and enhance the overall security posture of their cloud environment, aligning
  with industry best practices and regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud database deployments are utilizing
  private networking configurations to restrict data access to secure, internal networks.
  By enforcing private networking, data traffic is isolated from the public internet,
  reducing exposure to external threats and mitigating the risk of data interception
  or unauthorized access. Implementing private networking aligns with compliance standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that sensitive data is handled with enhanced security
  measures and minimized risk.
