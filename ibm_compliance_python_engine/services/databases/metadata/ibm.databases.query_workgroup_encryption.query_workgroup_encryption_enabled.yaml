rule_id: ibm.databases.query_workgroup_encryption.query_workgroup_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption is Enabled for Query Workgroups in IBM Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for query workgroups is crucial to safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that any data
  processed or temporarily stored by the query workgroup is protected, thereby maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality. This measure is vital for meeting regulatory
  compliance standards and building customer trust by demonstrating a commitment to
  data security.
description: This rule checks that encryption is enabled for query workgroups within
  IBM Cloud databases. When enabled, this feature encrypts all data accessed and processed
  by the query workgroup, ensuring data at rest and in transit remains secure. Implementing
  encryption at this level reduces the risk of data exposure and aligns with industry
  best practices and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  robust data protection measures. By adhering to this rule, organizations can significantly
  enhance their security posture and reduce the likelihood of data breaches.
