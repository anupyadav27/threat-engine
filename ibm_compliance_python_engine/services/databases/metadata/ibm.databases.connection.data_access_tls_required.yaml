rule_id: ibm.databases.connection.data_access_tls_required
title: Enforce TLS for Secure Database Connection Data Access
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that data access over database connections is secured with TLS
  encryption is critical to protect sensitive information from interception during
  transit. Without TLS, data could be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to potential
  data breaches and compliance violations, which can result in financial penalties
  and damage to the organization's reputation.
description: This rule verifies that all database connections enforce TLS encryption
  to secure data in transit between clients and database servers. By requiring TLS,
  the rule ensures that data is encrypted, providing a secure channel for the transfer
  of sensitive information, thereby mitigating risks of eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This not only strengthens the security posture of database services but
  also assists in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others
  that mandate encryption of data in transit.
