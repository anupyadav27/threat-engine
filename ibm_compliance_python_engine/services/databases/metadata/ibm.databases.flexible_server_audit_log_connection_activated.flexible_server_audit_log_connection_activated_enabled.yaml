title: Ensure Audit Log Connection Activation for Flexible Server
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit log connections for flexible servers is crucial for maintaining
  an accurate record of database access and activities. This helps in identifying
  and responding to unauthorized access attempts, thereby protecting sensitive data
  from potential breaches. Moreover, maintaining audit logs is often a regulatory
  requirement, ensuring compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This security rule verifies that the audit log connection is activated
  for flexible servers within the IBM Cloud database services. By ensuring that audit
  logs are enabled, organizations can track access attempts and modifications to the
  database, which is critical for forensic investigations and security audits. Activating
  audit log connections helps in identifying security incidents in real-time, enabling
  prompt response and mitigation. Furthermore, it supports compliance with regulatory
  standards by providing a verifiable audit trail of user activities and access patterns.
