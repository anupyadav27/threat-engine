rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.snapshot_encrypted
title: Ensure Database Cluster Snapshots Are Encrypted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting database cluster snapshots is crucial to protect sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Unencrypted snapshots can expose
  critical information if they are accessed by malicious actors, leading to data leaks
  and compliance violations. Encrypting snapshots helps organizations maintain data
  integrity and confidentiality, aligning with data protection regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether the snapshots of database clusters in IBM Cloud
  are encrypted at rest. By ensuring that snapshots are encrypted, organizations can
  prevent unauthorized access to stored data, even if the physical storage media is
  compromised. Encrypted snapshots safeguard sensitive information, support compliance
  with industry standards, and reduce the risk of data breaches. Implementing encryption
  for snapshots enhances the security posture of cloud databases by ensuring that
  all data, including backups, is protected against unauthorized access and manipulation.
