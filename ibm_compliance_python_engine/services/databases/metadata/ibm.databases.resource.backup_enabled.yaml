rule_id: ibm.databases.resource.backup_enabled
title: Ensure Backups Are Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling backups for IBM Cloud databases is crucial for data protection
  and recovery. Regular backups mitigate data loss risks caused by accidental deletions,
  cyberattacks, or system failures, ensuring business continuity and compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that automatic backups are enabled for databases in
  IBM Cloud. Enabling backups ensures that data is regularly saved and can be restored
  in the event of data corruption or loss. This practice not only enhances the security
  posture by safeguarding against data breaches and loss but also aids in adhering
  to compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other industry-specific regulations.
  Regular backups contribute to a resilient and reliable data management strategy,
  reducing downtime and potential business disruption.
