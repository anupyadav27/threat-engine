rule_id: ibm.databases.dataset_public_access.dataset_public_access_blocked
title: Block Public Access to IBM Cloud Database Datasets
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that databases do not have public access is critical to safeguarding
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Publicly accessible
  datasets can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data leaks, regulatory
  non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage to an organization.
description: This rule checks for any instances where datasets in IBM Cloud databases
  are configured with public access. By enforcing a policy to block public access,
  it strengthens the overall security posture by minimizing exposure to unauthorized
  users. This practice not only reduces the attack surface but also aligns with best
  practices and regulatory requirements for data protection, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  Implementing such restrictions ensures that only authenticated and authorized users
  can access sensitive data, thereby maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of the organization's information assets.
