rule_id: ibm.databases.cluster.monitoring_log_export
title: Enforce Monitoring Log Export for IBM Cloud Databases Clusters
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring the export of monitoring logs for database clusters is critical
  for maintaining security visibility and incident response capabilities. Without
  proper logging, unauthorized access and anomalies may go undetected, leading to
  potential data breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud databases clusters are configured to
  export monitoring logs to a designated logging service. By enabling log export,
  organizations enhance their ability to track access and modifications, facilitating
  better forensic analysis and audit readiness. Adhering to this practice not only
  strengthens security posture by ensuring continuous monitoring but also supports
  compliance with standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR, which require detailed activity
  logs for audit trails.
