title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for IBM Cloud databases is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that
  even if physical security is compromised, the data remains unreadable and secure.
  This practice not only safeguards customer trust but also helps organizations meet
  regulatory and compliance requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for IBM
  Cloud database services, ensuring that stored data is encrypted using standardized
  cryptographic algorithms. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent data
  exfiltration through physical theft or unauthorized access to storage media. Implementing
  encryption at rest enhances the overall security posture, providing a robust layer
  of protection for sensitive data and aligning with compliance standards such as
  GDPR and HIPAA.
