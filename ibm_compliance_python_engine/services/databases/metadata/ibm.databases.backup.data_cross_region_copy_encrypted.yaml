title: Ensure Cross-Region Backup Data Encryption for IBM Cloud Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting cross-region backup data ensures that sensitive information
  remains secure during transit and storage, protecting against unauthorized access
  and data breaches. This practice is crucial for maintaining customer trust, meeting
  regulatory requirements, and avoiding potential financial and reputational damage
  due to data exposure.
description: This rule verifies that all backup data copies created and stored across
  different regions within IBM Cloud databases are encrypted. Encryption of data at
  rest and during transit is a fundamental security measure that mitigates risks associated
  with data breaches and unauthorized access. By ensuring backups are encrypted, organizations
  can enhance their data protection strategies, align with industry best practices,
  and comply with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing
  encryption for cross-region backups also supports robust disaster recovery plans
  by safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality.
