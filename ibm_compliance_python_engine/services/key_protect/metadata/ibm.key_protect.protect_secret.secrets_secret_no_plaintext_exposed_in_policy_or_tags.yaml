rule_id: ibm.key_protect.protect_secret.secrets_secret_no_plaintext_exposed_in_policy_or_tags
title: Prevent Plaintext Exposure in Key Protect Policies and Tags
severity: critical
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Exposing plaintext secrets in policy definitions or tags can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, compromising the security of critical business
  information. It is crucial to ensure that secret values are not inadvertently exposed
  in human-readable formats to maintain the integrity of key management practices
  and compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks for any occurrences where plaintext secrets are exposed
  within policy definitions or tags in IBM Cloud's Key Protect service. By ensuring
  that secret values are encrypted or obfuscated in these areas, organizations can
  protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Adhering to this rule enhances
  overall security posture, reduces the risk of data leaks, and helps meet regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate strict control over
  data handling and access.
