title: Ensure Secrets Certificates Have Trusted Issuers in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that secrets certificates are issued by trusted authorities is
  crucial to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data managed
  by IBM Key Protect. Certificates from untrusted issuers can compromise data security,
  leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, which can have significant
  business and compliance repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that all secrets certificates stored and managed within
  IBM Key Protect are issued by trusted certificate authorities (CAs). By enforcing
  the use of trusted issuers, the rule helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
  and ensures that only authenticated entities can access the protected keys. Adhering
  to this rule enhances the security posture of your cloud environment and supports
  compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-57.
