title: Ensure Intentional Deletion Protocols for CMKs in IBM Key Protect
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting Customer Master Keys (CMKs) from unintentional deletion is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and availability. Accidental deletion of CMKs can
  lead to data loss or inaccessibility, impacting business operations and potentially
  violating compliance requirements. Ensuring that CMKs are deleted only through intentional
  and verified processes helps safeguard sensitive data and maintain trust with customers.
description: This rule verifies that deletion protection mechanisms are enabled for
  Customer Master Keys in IBM Key Protect, ensuring that keys cannot be removed unintentionally.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent accidental key deletions that
  could lead to data being irretrievable, thereby enhancing data protection and compliance
  with data privacy regulations. The implementation of deletion protection protocols
  serves as a safeguard against human error, ensuring that key management processes
  are deliberate and controlled.
