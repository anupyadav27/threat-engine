rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key.not_scheduled_for_deletion
title: Ensure IBM Key Protect Keys Are Not Scheduled for Deletion
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that cryptographic keys are not prematurely scheduled for deletion
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability. Inadvertent deletion
  of keys can lead to data loss and service disruption, impacting business continuity
  and potentially violating data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks if any cryptographic keys managed by IBM Key Protect
  are scheduled for deletion. By preventing such keys from being marked for deletion,
  organizations can safeguard against accidental data encryption key loss, which is
  vital for accessing encrypted data. Adhering to this rule enhances security by maintaining
  control over cryptographic assets and aligns with compliance standards that require
  robust data protection mechanisms.
