title: Ensure Secrets Alias Points to an Active Key in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that a secrets alias points to an active key is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and availability of your encrypted data. If a secrets alias refers
  to an inactive or deleted key, it could lead to disruptions in accessing encrypted
  data, potentially impacting business operations and compromising data security.
  This practice helps maintain continuous data protection and compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This rule checks that each secrets alias in the IBM Key Protect service
  is mapped to an active key. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent potential
  data access issues that arise when a secrets alias points to an inactive key. It
  strengthens security by ensuring that encryption keys are available and valid, which
  is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. Compliance benefits
  include adherence to regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  stringent key management practices to protect sensitive information.
