title: Enforce Secure String Parameter for Sensitive Secrets in Key Protect
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring the use of secure string types for sensitive secrets in IBM Cloud's
  Key Protect service is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
  Mismanaged secrets can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential
  financial and reputational damage to the organization. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information, thus upholding regulatory compliance
  and safeguarding business operations.
description: This rule checks that sensitive secrets within the IBM Key Protect instance
  policy are configured using secure string types. Secure string parameters ensure
  that sensitive data, such as API keys or passwords, are encrypted both at rest and
  in transit, preventing unauthorized access. Implementing this security measure enhances
  the overall security posture by aligning with best practices and compliance standards
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is
  adequately protected against potential threats.
