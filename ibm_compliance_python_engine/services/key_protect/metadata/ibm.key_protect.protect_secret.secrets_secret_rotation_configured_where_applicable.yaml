title: Ensure Secret Rotation is Configured for IBM Key Protect Secrets
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Regularly rotating secrets is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access due to compromised credentials. Implementing secret rotation helps ensure
  that any leaked credentials have a limited lifespan, significantly reducing the
  potential impact on business operations and data security. It also demonstrates
  adherence to security best practices and regulatory requirements, safeguarding organizational
  and client data.
description: This rule checks whether secret rotation policies are configured for
  secrets managed through IBM Key Protect, where applicable. By enforcing automatic
  rotation of secrets, organizations enhance their security posture by reducing the
  window of opportunity for malicious actors exploiting exposed secrets. Furthermore,
  automated secret rotation supports compliance with various industry standards and
  regulations, such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001, by ensuring that sensitive information
  is frequently updated and less vulnerable to attacks.
