rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key.data_warehouse_hsm_client_cert_not_expired
title: Ensure Data Warehouse HSM Client Certificates Are Valid in Key Protect
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring the validity of Data Warehouse HSM client certificates is crucial
  to maintaining secure encryption and key management practices in IBM Cloud. Expired
  certificates can lead to unauthorized access, potential data breaches, and compromise
  the integrity of encrypted data, impacting business operations and compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This security rule checks for the expiration status of client certificates
  used in conjunction with Hardware Security Modules (HSM) within IBM Key Protect.
  By verifying that these certificates are not expired, organizations can ensure that
  only authorized entities can access and manage encryption keys, thus enhancing the
  security of data at rest. Adhering to this rule supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by maintaining robust
  encryption practices and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
