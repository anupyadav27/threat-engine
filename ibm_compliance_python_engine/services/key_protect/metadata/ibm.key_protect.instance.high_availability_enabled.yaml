rule_id: ibm.key_protect.instance.high_availability_enabled
title: Ensure High Availability for IBM Key Protect Instances
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: High availability in IBM Key Protect ensures that cryptographic keys remain
  accessible and secure even in the event of system failures or data center outages.
  This capability is crucial for maintaining the continuity of business operations
  and safeguarding sensitive data, as it minimizes the risk of data loss and service
  disruptions that can lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether high availability is enabled for instances in
  IBM Key Protect. By enabling high availability, organizations can distribute cryptographic
  keys across multiple data centers, thereby enhancing redundancy and fault tolerance.
  This configuration not only improves the reliability of key management operations
  but also aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for data
  protection and encryption at rest. Ensuring high availability is a proactive measure
  that supports compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent
  data protection measures.
