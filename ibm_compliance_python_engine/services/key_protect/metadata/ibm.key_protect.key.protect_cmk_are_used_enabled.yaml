title: Ensure Custom Master Keys (CMKs) are Active in IBM Key Protect
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling the use of Custom Master Keys (CMKs) in IBM Key Protect is pivotal
  for maintaining robust data security and privacy. CMKs provide an additional layer
  of encryption, ensuring that sensitive data is protected against unauthorized access
  and complies with industry standards and regulatory requirements. The use of CMKs
  enhances trust and confidence among stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to
  data integrity and security.
description: This rule checks if Custom Master Keys (CMKs) are actively utilized within
  IBM Key Protect. By enforcing the use of CMKs, organizations can enhance their data
  encryption strategy, ensuring that encryption keys are managed securely and efficiently.
  This practice not only strengthens the overall security posture but also aids in
  achieving compliance with various data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and others. The rule ensures that encryption at rest is implemented effectively,
  safeguarding sensitive information against potential breaches and unauthorized access.
