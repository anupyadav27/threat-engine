rule_id: ibm.key_protect.instance_policy.data_warehouse_hsm_only_approved_hsm_endpoints
title: Enforce Use of Approved HSM Endpoints for Key Protect Data Warehouses
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that only approved HSM endpoints are utilized for data warehouses
  within IBM Key Protect is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of encrypted data. Unauthorized or unapproved endpoints may present vulnerabilities,
  leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This rule helps organizations
  mitigate risks and ensures compliance with industry standards for data protection.
description: This rule verifies that all data warehouses using IBM Key Protect are
  configured to interact exclusively with approved HSM (Hardware Security Module)
  endpoints. By enforcing this configuration, organizations can ensure that all encryption
  keys used for data at rest are securely managed and protected by trusted hardware
  devices. This enhances the overall security posture by preventing unauthorized access
  to sensitive data and supports compliance with regulations that require robust encryption
  standards and key management practices.
