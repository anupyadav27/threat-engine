rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key.secrets_alias_has_alias
title: Ensure All Key Protect Secrets Have a Defined Alias
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Associating an alias with a secret in IBM Cloud Key Protect enhances manageability
  and accessibility. This practice ensures that cryptographic keys are easily identifiable
  and retrievable, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access or operational errors.
  It also aids in maintaining compliance with industry standards that require clear
  key management processes.
description: This rule verifies that every secret stored in IBM Cloud Key Protect
  has an associated alias. An alias acts as a human-readable identifier which simplifies
  key management by allowing administrators to reference keys without using the actual
  key material. Establishing aliases for keys not only bolsters security by minimizing
  misconfiguration risks but also supports auditing and compliance efforts by providing
  clear documentation and tracking of key usage. Implementing this rule aligns with
  best practices for cryptographic key management as outlined in various security
  frameworks.
