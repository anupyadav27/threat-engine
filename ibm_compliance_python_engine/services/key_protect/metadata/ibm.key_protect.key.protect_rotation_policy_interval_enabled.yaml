title: Enforce Key Rotation Policy Interval in IBM Key Protect
severity: medium
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Regular key rotation is critical for maintaining the security of sensitive
  data, as it minimizes the window of exposure in the event of a key compromise. By
  enforcing a key rotation policy interval, organizations can ensure that cryptographic
  keys are refreshed periodically, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and aligning
  with industry best practices and regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks whether a rotation policy interval is enabled for keys
  managed within IBM Key Protect. Enabling a rotation policy ensures that keys are
  automatically rotated at specified intervals, enhancing security by limiting the
  lifespan of encryption keys. This practice not only mitigates potential risks associated
  with key exposure but also aids in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR, PCI
  DSS, and others that mandate regular key rotation. Implementing this control helps
  maintain robust key management hygiene and strengthens the overall security posture
  of the organization's cloud environment.
