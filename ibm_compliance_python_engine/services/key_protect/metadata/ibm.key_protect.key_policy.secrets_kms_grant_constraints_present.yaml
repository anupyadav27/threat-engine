title: Enforce Secrets KMS Grant Constraints in IBM Key Protect Policies
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that Secrets KMS Grant Constraints are present within IBM Key
  Protect key policies is crucial for mitigating unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By applying these constraints, organizations can enforce strict controls
  over who can access and manage encryption keys, thus safeguarding sensitive data
  and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks for the presence of KMS Grant Constraints within IBM
  Key Protect key policies, ensuring that access to encryption keys is tightly controlled.
  Implementing these constraints helps to restrict permissions to only those users
  and services that absolutely require access, significantly reducing the risk of
  unauthorized actions. Moreover, adhering to this rule supports compliance with industry
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate robust data protection measures.
  By maintaining a secure key management posture, organizations can protect their
  cryptographic assets from potential threats.
