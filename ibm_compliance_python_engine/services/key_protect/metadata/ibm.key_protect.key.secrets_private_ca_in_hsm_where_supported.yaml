title: Enforce HSM Storage for Private CA Secrets in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Storing private Certificate Authority (CA) secrets in a Hardware Security
  Module (HSM) enhances the security of cryptographic keys by providing physical and
  logical protection against unauthorized access. This rule ensures that sensitive
  cryptographic operations are isolated and protected within an HSM, thereby reducing
  the risk of key compromise and maintaining trust in the CA infrastructure. Non-compliance
  can lead to severe security breaches, financial loss, and damage to organizational
  reputation.
description: This rule checks whether private CA secrets managed by IBM Key Protect
  are stored in an HSM, where supported. By enforcing HSM storage, the rule leverages
  the robust security controls of HSMs, such as tamper resistance and secure key management,
  to protect cryptographic keys. Implementing this rule helps maintain compliance
  with industry standards and regulations that mandate the use of HSMs for managing
  cryptographic keys, thereby strengthening the overall security posture of the organization.
