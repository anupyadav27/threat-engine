rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key_policy.secrets_kms_grant_grantee_principal_valid
title: Validate Grantee Principals in Secrets KMS Key Policies
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that grantee principals in Secrets KMS key policies are valid
  is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of cryptographic operations.
  Invalid or improperly configured principals can lead to unauthorized access, potentially
  exposing sensitive data and violating compliance requirements. This rule helps prevent
  security breaches and ensures that only authorized entities can perform cryptographic
  functions.
description: This rule checks whether the grantee principals specified in IBM Key
  Protect key policies for secrets management are valid and correctly configured.
  By validating these principals, the rule ensures that only authorized users or services
  have the permissions to access or manage cryptographic keys. This practice strengthens
  access control mechanisms, minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure, and
  aligns with industry compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this
  rule helps organizations maintain a robust security posture by ensuring that key
  management policies are strictly enforced.
