title: Enforce Restrictive Permissions for IBM Key Protect Secrets Management
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that Key Management Service (KMS) grants do not include wildcard
  permissions is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to encryption
  keys. Wildcard permissions can inadvertently provide broader access than intended,
  potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation. Adhering
  to this rule helps protect sensitive data, maintain customer trust, and comply with
  regulatory requirements.
description: This security rule checks IBM Key Protect key policies to ensure that
  permissions granted to secrets management services are more restrictive than wildcard
  permissions. By enforcing specific grants rather than wildcard entries, organizations
  can significantly reduce the attack surface and limit access to only those actions
  necessary for operational purposes. This approach enhances security by providing
  fine-grained access control and supports compliance with industry standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict data protection measures.
