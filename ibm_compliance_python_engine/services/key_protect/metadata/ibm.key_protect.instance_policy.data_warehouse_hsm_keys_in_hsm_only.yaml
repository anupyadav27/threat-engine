title: Enforce HSM-Only Key Storage for Data Warehouse Encryption
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that cryptographic keys for data warehouses are stored exclusively
  in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) is crucial for maintaining the highest level
  of security. This practice mitigates the risk of key exposure, provides robust protection
  against unauthorized access, and aligns with stringent compliance standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA. Adopting HSM-only key storage enhances trust and reliability
  in the secure management of sensitive data.
description: This rule verifies that all cryptographic keys associated with data warehouse
  instances are stored in HSMs, rather than in software-based key stores. By mandating
  HSM usage, the rule leverages tamper-resistant hardware to safeguard encryption
  keys, thereby fortifying encryption at rest. This approach not only heightens security
  by leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques but also supports compliance with
  regulatory requirements that demand strong data protection measures. Implementing
  this rule within IBM Cloud's Key Protect service ensures that sensitive data remains
  secure and compliant with industry standards.
