title: Ensure KMS Configured for Secrets in IBM Key Protect Instance Policies
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Configuring a Key Management Service (KMS) for managing secrets within
  IBM Key Protect ensures that sensitive information is encrypted and securely stored.
  This configuration is crucial for protecting data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches, thereby maintaining the organization's reputation and trust. By leveraging
  KMS, businesses can enforce strict access controls and meet regulatory compliance
  requirements for data protection.
description: This rule checks whether the Key Management Service (KMS) is configured
  for the secrets parameter in IBM Key Protect instance policies. Implementing KMS
  ensures that all secrets, such as API keys and credentials, are encrypted using
  robust cryptographic standards. This enhances the security posture of the organization
  by preventing unauthorized access and data leaks. Furthermore, configuring KMS aids
  in achieving compliance with industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS,
  which mandate strong data protection measures.
