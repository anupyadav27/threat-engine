title: Enforce Private Endpoints for IBM Cloud Key Protect Service
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling private endpoints for the IBM Cloud Key Protect service ensures
  that traffic between your applications and the Key Protect service is transmitted
  over a secure, private network. This minimizes exposure to the public internet,
  significantly reducing the attack surface and safeguarding sensitive cryptographic
  operations and data from potential cyber threats. By leveraging private endpoints,
  organizations can achieve enhanced compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements pertaining to data protection and privacy.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM Cloud Key Protect service is configured
  to use private endpoints, which restrict API access to the service over IBM Cloud's
  private network. By implementing this configuration, organizations ensure that communications
  with the Key Protect service are isolated from the public internet, thereby reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This setup bolsters network security
  by enforcing network access control, leading to improved compliance with frameworks
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate the protection of sensitive data.
