title: Ensure Public Access to IBM Key Protect Keys is Blocked
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to cryptographic keys within IBM Key Protect is
  crucial to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Unauthorized
  access to these keys can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and damage to the
  organization's reputation. By ensuring keys are not publicly accessible, organizations
  can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized data decryption and enhance their
  overall security posture.
description: This rule verifies that public access to keys managed by IBM Key Protect
  is effectively blocked. The check ensures that cryptographic keys, which are critical
  for data encryption and protection, are not exposed to unauthorized users over the
  internet. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent data leakage and unauthorized
  data manipulation, thus reinforcing their compliance with industry standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this rule strengthens the organization's identity
  and access management framework by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized
  users can access sensitive encryption keys.
