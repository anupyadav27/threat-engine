title: Ensure KMS Configuration for Secrets in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Properly configuring Key Management Service (KMS) for secrets within IBM
  Key Protect is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining control over
  encryption keys. This setup ensures that secrets are encrypted and managed with
  robust security controls, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  Inadequate KMS configuration can lead to compliance violations and potential financial
  penalties.
description: This rule verifies that the secrets stored in IBM Key Protect are configured
  with Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring that encryption keys are managed securely.
  By enforcing this configuration, organizations can leverage advanced encryption
  standards and maintain strict control over key access and lifecycle management.
  This practice not only strengthens data protection mechanisms but also supports
  adherence to various regulatory requirements like GDPR and HIPAA, thus enhancing
  the overall security posture.
