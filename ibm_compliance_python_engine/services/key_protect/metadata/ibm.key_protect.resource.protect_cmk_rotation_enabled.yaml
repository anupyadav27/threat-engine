title: Ensure CMK Rotation is Enabled in IBM Key Protect for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Customer Master Key (CMK) rotation is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of encrypted data. Regular key rotation mitigates
  the risk of key compromise by limiting the time window for potential exploitation.
  This practice enhances compliance with data protection regulations and reduces the
  impact of any potential security breaches on business operations.
description: This rule verifies that automatic rotation is enabled for Customer Master
  Keys (CMKs) managed within IBM Key Protect. Enabling key rotation ensures that encryption
  keys are periodically changed, minimizing the risk associated with long-term key
  usage. This practice enhances data protection by automatically replacing keys at
  regular intervals, which can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements by demonstrating
  a proactive approach to data security and encryption management.
