title: Ensure CRL or OCSP is Configured for IBM Key Protect Secrets
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or Online Certificate Status
  Protocol (OCSP) for IBM Key Protect is crucial for maintaining the integrity and
  trust of your cryptographic operations. Neglecting this configuration could lead
  to the use of compromised or expired certificates, posing significant security risks
  such as data breaches or unauthorized access. Ensuring that CRL or OCSP is properly
  configured helps maintain the reliability of your security infrastructure and protects
  sensitive business data from potential threats.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Key Protect has CRL or OCSP configured for
  secrets that rely on private certificates. By enforcing the usage of CRL or OCSP,
  this rule ensures that any compromised or revoked certificates are promptly identified
  and not used for secure communications. This not only enhances the security posture
  by preventing unauthorized access but also aids in meeting compliance standards
  such as PCI-DSS and ISO 27001, which mandate the management of certificate revocation.
  Implementing this configuration helps in maintaining a robust and secure cloud environment
  by ensuring that only valid and trusted certificates are in use.
