title: Enforce Path Length Constraints for Secrets Manager Private CA
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that path length constraints are set for private CAs in IBM Key
  Protect is crucial for maintaining secure certificate hierarchies. Misconfigurations
  can lead to unauthorized certificate issuance, compromising the integrity of your
  secure communications and potentially leading to data breaches. By adhering to these
  constraints, organizations can mitigate risks related to certificate misuse, thus
  protecting sensitive information and maintaining trust in their digital infrastructure.
description: This rule checks that path length constraints are correctly configured
  for private Certificate Authorities (CAs) within IBM Key Protect. By enforcing these
  constraints, organizations can control the depth of the certificate chain, preventing
  unauthorized issuance and maintaining a secure certificate hierarchy. This enhances
  the overall security posture by ensuring that certificates cannot be arbitrarily
  created, which is vital for compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS and
  GDPR, ensuring that the organization meets both regulatory requirements and industry
  best practices.
