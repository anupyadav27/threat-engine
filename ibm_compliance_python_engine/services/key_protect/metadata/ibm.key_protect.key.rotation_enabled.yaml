title: Enforce Key Rotation for Enhanced Security in IBM Key Protect
severity: medium
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Enabling key rotation in IBM Key Protect ensures that cryptographic keys
  are periodically changed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Regular key rotation limits the exposure time of a compromised key,
  thus enhancing the overall security posture of an organization's data protection
  strategy.
description: This rule verifies that key rotation is enabled for cryptographic keys
  managed within IBM Key Protect. When key rotation is enforced, it automatically
  updates keys according to a defined schedule, mitigating risks associated with key
  compromise and cryptographic failures. Implementing key rotation aligns with industry
  best practices and compliance standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-57,
  which advocate for regular updates to cryptographic keys to protect sensitive information.
