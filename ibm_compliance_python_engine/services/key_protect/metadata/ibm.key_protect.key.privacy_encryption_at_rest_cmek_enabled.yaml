title: Ensure Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for Data Privacy in IBM Key
  Protect
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing the use of Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data encryption
  at rest is crucial for maintaining control over sensitive information, meeting strict
  compliance requirements, and mitigating risks associated with unauthorized data
  access. This rule helps organizations protect their data assets by ensuring that
  encryption keys are managed by the customer, enhancing data sovereignty and reducing
  potential exposure to external threats.
description: This rule verifies that all keys within IBM Cloud's Key Protect service
  are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). By enabling CMEK, organizations
  retain full control over their encryption keys, allowing them to manage key rotation,
  revocation, and lifecycle. This practice not only strengthens data protection by
  ensuring that encryption keys are not accessible to unauthorized parties, but also
  aligns with compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which require
  stringent encryption measures to safeguard sensitive data.
