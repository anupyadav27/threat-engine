title: Enforce Rotation for Rotatable Secrets in IBM Key Protect Vaults
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Enabling automatic rotation for rotatable secrets in IBM Key Protect enhances
  security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised keys.
  Regularly rotating secrets protects sensitive data and aligns with compliance standards,
  reducing the potential impact of data breaches and ensuring that cryptographic materials
  remain robust against evolving threats.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Key Protect vaults have automatic rotation
  enabled for all rotatable secrets. By enforcing this configuration, organizations
  ensure that secrets are periodically changed, which helps protect against vulnerabilities
  associated with long-lived credentials. Regular key rotation is a critical component
  of a comprehensive key management strategy, contributing to compliance with industry
  standards and regulations, such as NIST and GDPR, by ensuring that cryptographic
  keys have a limited useful lifespan and are regularly updated.
