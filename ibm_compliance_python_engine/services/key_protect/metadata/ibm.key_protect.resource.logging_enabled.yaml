title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Key Protect Resources
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for IBM Key Protect resources is critical for maintaining
  visibility into key management operations, detecting unauthorized access attempts,
  and ensuring traceability of actions. This helps organizations meet regulatory compliance
  requirements and enhances their ability to respond promptly to security incidents.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for IBM Key Protect resources,
  ensuring that all key management operations are recorded and auditable. Logging
  provides a detailed account of actions taken on cryptographic keys, which is essential
  for identifying potential security breaches and understanding the operational environment.
  By maintaining comprehensive logs, organizations can improve their security posture
  and demonstrate compliance with industry standards and regulations.
