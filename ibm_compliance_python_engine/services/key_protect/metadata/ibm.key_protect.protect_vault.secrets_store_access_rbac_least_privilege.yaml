title: Enforce Least Privilege for Secrets Store Access in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for access to the secrets
  store in IBM Key Protect ensures that users have only the permissions necessary
  to perform their jobs, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of sensitive cryptographic keys and secrets, which are vital assets for business
  operations and compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks that access to the IBM Key Protect secrets store is
  managed using role-based access control (RBAC) with the least privilege principle.
  Specifically, it verifies that users and service accounts have the minimal set of
  permissions required for their roles, preventing excessive access rights that could
  lead to data exposure or misuse. By adhering to this best practice, organizations
  enhance their security posture, protect sensitive information, and align with compliance
  frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, which advocate for stringent
  access controls.
