title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Key Protect Secrets Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for accessing sensitive secrets
  in IBM Cloud's Key Protect service is crucial for minimizing potential security
  breaches. By ensuring that users and applications only have the permissions necessary
  for their roles, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized
  access to confidential information, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining
  compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule evaluates the access permissions configured in IBM Cloud's
  Key Protect instance policies to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  Specifically, it checks that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings are configured
  to limit access to secrets only to those users or services with a legitimate need.
  This security posture enforces stringent access controls that reduce the attack
  surface, prevent data breaches, and align with compliance standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, thereby strengthening the overall security framework of the organization.
