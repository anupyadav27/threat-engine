rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key.expiration_set
title: Ensure Key Expiration is Set for IBM Key Protect Keys
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Setting an expiration for cryptographic keys in IBM Key Protect is crucial
  to maintain the security and integrity of encrypted data. Expired keys help mitigate
  the risk of unauthorized data access by ensuring that keys are periodically rotated
  and retired. This practice reduces vulnerabilities associated with long-lived keys,
  which can become compromised over time, thus protecting sensitive business data
  and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that cryptographic keys stored in IBM Key Protect
  have an expiration date set. By enforcing key expiration, organizations can ensure
  that keys do not remain active indefinitely, which enhances data protection and
  aligns with best practices for key management. Expiring keys facilitate automatic
  key rotation, reducing the window of exposure in case of key compromise and supporting
  compliance with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. This check helps maintain
  a robust encryption strategy by ensuring that all keys are periodically reviewed
  and replaced as needed.
