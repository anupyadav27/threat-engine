title: Enforce Minimum Length for Data Warehouse HSM Client Certificates
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that client certificates for Hardware Security Module (HSM) access
  have a minimum length is crucial for maintaining strong encryption and secure data
  protection. Shorter certificate lengths can be vulnerable to attacks, potentially
  leading to unauthorized data access and compromising business operations. By enforcing
  a minimum length, organizations can enhance their data security posture and align
  with best practices in cryptographic standards.
description: This rule checks whether the client certificates used for accessing IBM
  Cloud Key Protect's Data Warehouse HSM meet a specified minimum length requirement.
  Certificates that do not meet the minimum length are flagged, as shorter certificates
  may be susceptible to brute force or other cryptographic attacks. By enforcing this
  rule, organizations can ensure robust encryption at rest, thus safeguarding sensitive
  data and adhering to compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strong
  encryption measures to protect personal and sensitive information.
