title: Ensure Data Warehouse HSM Configuration is Present for Key Protect Instances
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that a Hardware Security Module (HSM) configuration is present
  for IBM Key Protect instances enhances the security of encryption keys by leveraging
  dedicated hardware for key management. This configuration minimizes the risk of
  unauthorized access to sensitive data, helping organizations meet stringent data
  protection and privacy regulations and reducing potential business impacts from
  data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that an HSM configuration is enabled for IBM Key Protect
  instances, ensuring that encryption keys are managed with a higher level of security.
  By using HSMs, organizations can isolate cryptographic operations and keys within
  a secure hardware environment, thereby increasing the protection against tampering
  and unauthorized access. Implementing this rule not only strengthens the security
  posture of data-at-rest but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards
  and regulatory requirements related to data protection and encryption.
