title: Enforce KMS Encryption for Secrets in IBM Key Protect Vaults
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that secrets stored in IBM Key Protect Vaults are encrypted using
  Key Management Service (KMS) is crucial for protecting sensitive data against unauthorized
  access. This practice not only safeguards encryption keys and secrets from potential
  data breaches but also meets stringent compliance requirements, thereby mitigating
  the risk of regulatory penalties and preserving customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all secrets stored within the IBM Key Protect
  Vaults are encrypted using IBM's Key Management Service. By enabling KMS encryption,
  organizations can leverage advanced encryption standards to secure sensitive data
  at rest, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. This approach aligns with
  best practices for data protection and assists in achieving compliance with industry
  standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Regularly checking and enforcing this
  encryption setting helps maintain a strong security posture by minimizing the risk
  of data exposure.
