title: Ensure CMK Multi-Region Support for Enhanced Resilience and Compliance
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling multi-region support for Customer Master Keys (CMKs) in IBM Key
  Protect enhances data resilience by ensuring key availability even in the event
  of a regional outage. This configuration helps in maintaining data accessibility
  and integrity across multiple geographical locations, thereby supporting business
  continuity. Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance requirements for data protection
  and privacy by ensuring that encryption keys are managed with high availability
  and fault tolerance.
description: This rule checks whether Customer Master Keys (CMKs) managed by IBM Key
  Protect are configured with multi-region support, a feature that replicates keys
  across different IBM Cloud regions. By enabling this feature, organizations can
  mitigate risks associated with regional failures, ensuring that encrypted data remains
  accessible and secure. This approach not only strengthens data protection strategies
  by providing geographic redundancy but also supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulations that mandate robust encryption key management practices.
