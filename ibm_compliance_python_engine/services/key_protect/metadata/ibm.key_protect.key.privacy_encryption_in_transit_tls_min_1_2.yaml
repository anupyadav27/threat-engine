title: Ensure TLS 1.2+ for Key Protect Encryption In Transit
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Utilizing TLS 1.2 or higher for encrypting data in transit is critical
  to safeguarding sensitive information from interception and unauthorized access.
  This encryption standard helps to prevent data breaches and maintain the confidentiality
  and integrity of sensitive keys during transmission, which is essential for compliance
  with industry regulations and protecting business reputation.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Key Protect services enforce a minimum of
  TLS 1.2 for all encrypted data exchanges in transit. By ensuring that data is encrypted
  using a strong and up-to-date protocol, this rule enhances the security posture
  by mitigating risks associated with older, less secure protocols. Compliance with
  this encryption standard is crucial for meeting regulatory requirements and industry
  best practices, thereby ensuring robust data protection and privacy.
