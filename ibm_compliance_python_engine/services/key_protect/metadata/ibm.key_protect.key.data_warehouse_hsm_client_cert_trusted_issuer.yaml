rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key.data_warehouse_hsm_client_cert_trusted_issuer
title: Ensure Trusted Issuer for Data Warehouse HSM Client Certificates
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that the issuer of a Data Warehouse HSM Client Certificate is
  trusted is critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data stored
  in the IBM Cloud. A trusted issuer guarantees that the certificates used for encrypting
  and decrypting data are authentic and have not been tampered with, thereby upholding
  compliance with data protection regulations and preventing unauthorized access to
  sensitive information.
description: This rule checks whether the Data Warehouse HSM Client Certificates used
  within IBM Key Protect are issued by a recognized and trusted Certificate Authority
  (CA). By verifying the trustworthiness of the certificate issuer, the rule ensures
  the security of encryption keys at rest, which is essential for protecting sensitive
  data against unauthorized access and breaches. Adhering to this rule helps organizations
  maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate the protection of data through secure encryption practices.
