title: Enforce Least Privilege for Secrets Private CA Access in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Secrets Private CA Access
  ensures that users and applications only have the minimum permissions necessary
  to perform their functions. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
  cryptographic keys and certificates, which could lead to data breaches or service
  disruptions. By minimizing access privileges, organizations can better protect their
  sensitive data and maintain compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks that RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies in IBM
  Key Protect are configured to enforce the least privilege principle for accessing
  Secrets Private CA. It ensures that roles assigned to users or applications allow
  only the necessary actions on cryptographic keys within the private networking scope.
  By adhering to this policy, organizations can enhance their security posture by
  minimizing the attack surface, preventing privilege escalation, and ensuring compliance
  with security standards and best practices.
