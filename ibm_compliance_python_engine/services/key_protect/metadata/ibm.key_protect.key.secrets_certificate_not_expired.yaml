rule_id: ibm.key_protect.key.secrets_certificate_not_expired
title: Ensure Secrets Certificate Validity in IBM Key Protect
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Maintaining valid certificates within IBM Key Protect is crucial for ensuring
  the integrity and trustworthiness of the cryptographic keys and secrets managed
  in the cloud. Expired certificates can lead to service disruptions, unauthorized
  access, and potential data breaches, thereby compromising business operations and
  regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that all certificates associated with secrets in IBM
  Key Protect are not expired. By ensuring that certificates are up-to-date, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized access and ensure data remains encrypted and secure. This
  practice enhances security posture by mitigating risks of vulnerabilities associated
  with expired certificates. Moreover, it supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, such as NIST and ISO, which require stringent key management practices.
