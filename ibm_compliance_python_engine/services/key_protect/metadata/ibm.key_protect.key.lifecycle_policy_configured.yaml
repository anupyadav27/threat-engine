title: Enforce Lifecycle Policy for Secure Key Management in IBM Key Protect
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring a lifecycle policy for cryptographic keys is crucial for ensuring
  data security and regulatory compliance. It helps prevent unauthorized access by
  automatically managing the rotation, expiration, and deletion of keys, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring that encryption keys adhere to organizational
  security policies.
description: This rule checks whether a lifecycle policy is configured for keys managed
  in IBM Key Protect. A lifecycle policy defines the automatic rotation, expiration,
  and deletion schedules for cryptographic keys, which enhances security by limiting
  the exposure of keys over time and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.
  By enforcing lifecycle policies, organizations can automate key management processes,
  minimize human error, and provide auditable key management practices that align
  with industry regulations and standards.
