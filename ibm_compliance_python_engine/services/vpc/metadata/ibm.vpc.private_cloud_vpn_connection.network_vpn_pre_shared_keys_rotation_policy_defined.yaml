title: Ensure VPN Pre-Shared Keys Rotation Policy is Defined for VPCs
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Regular rotation of VPN pre-shared keys is crucial for maintaining the
  integrity and confidentiality of communications over the network. Without a defined
  rotation policy, keys may become stale, increasing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Implementing a rotation policy enhances security posture
  and aligns with industry best practices for network security.
description: This rule checks whether a rotation policy is defined for network VPN
  pre-shared keys within IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments. A well-defined
  rotation policy ensures that keys are updated at regular intervals, minimizing the
  risk of exploitation from compromised or outdated keys. By enforcing a rotation
  policy, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and
  ensure compliance with security standards and regulations such as ISO 27001 and
  NIST SP 800-53. This proactive measure demonstrates a commitment to maintaining
  a robust security posture in cloud environments.
