title: Ensure Trust Boundaries for Allowed Principals on VPC Endpoint Services
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Defining trust boundaries for allowed principals on VPC endpoint services
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources. By restricting
  access to only trusted entities, organizations can minimize the risk of data breaches
  and maintain compliance with security regulations. This rule supports the enforcement
  of least privilege access, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
description: This rule checks for the specification of allowed principals within VPC
  endpoint services and ensures they are defined in accordance with established trust
  boundaries. By meticulously controlling which principals can access specific endpoint
  services, organizations can ensure that only authorized and trusted users or services
  can interact with critical resources. This practice not only strengthens the security
  framework but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations
  by demonstrating a commitment to securing network access.
