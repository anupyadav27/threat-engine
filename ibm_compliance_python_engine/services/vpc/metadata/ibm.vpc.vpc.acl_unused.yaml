rule_id: ibm.vpc.vpc.acl_unused
title: Detect and Mitigate Unused ACLs in IBM Cloud VPC Environments
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Unused Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) can
  lead to unnecessary complexity and potential misconfigurations in network security
  management. Regularly auditing and removing unused ACLs helps streamline security
  operations and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent exposure of
  resources. Ensuring that only necessary ACLs are maintained can contribute to a
  more robust and manageable security posture.
description: This rule checks for ACLs within IBM Cloud VPC environments that are
  not actively associated with any subnets. Unused ACLs can create confusion and increase
  the administrative overhead without providing any security value. By identifying
  and addressing these unused ACLs, organizations can enhance their network security
  by ensuring that only relevant and necessary access controls are in place. This
  practice not only aligns with security best practices but also supports compliance
  with security frameworks that mandate regular review and management of access controls.
