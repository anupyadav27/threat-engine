rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.compute_vm_security_group_inbound_restricted
title: Restrict Inbound Traffic to VPC Compute VM Security Groups
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting inbound traffic to virtual machines (VMs) within a private
  cloud server is critical in minimizing the attack surface and protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access. Implementing this rule helps prevent potential breaches
  and reduces the risk of exposure to malicious activities, thereby safeguarding business
  operations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule ensures that security groups associated with VPC private cloud
  servers are configured to limit inbound network traffic to only what is necessary
  for the server's operation. By enforcing strict inbound access controls, the rule
  reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access and potential attacks. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with security standards by demonstrating a proactive approach
  to network security, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the cloud
  environment.
