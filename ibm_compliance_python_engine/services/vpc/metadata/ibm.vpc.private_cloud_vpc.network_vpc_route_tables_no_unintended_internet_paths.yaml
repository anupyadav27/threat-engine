title: Ensure No Unintended Internet Paths in Private Cloud VPC Route Tables
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) route tables do not contain unintended
  paths to the internet is crucial for maintaining a secure network environment. Unintended
  internet paths could expose sensitive internal resources to external threats, leading
  to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. By controlling internet routes,
  organizations can minimize security risks and maintain regulatory compliance, protecting
  their business integrity.
description: This rule verifies that the route tables associated with IBM Cloud's
  private VPCs do not have routes that unintentionally direct traffic to the internet.
  It involves checking the route configurations to ensure that no default or broad
  CIDR ranges are mistakenly configured to route through an internet gateway. By enforcing
  this rule, organizations can prevent accidental exposure of private resources to
  the internet, thus reinforcing the security posture of their cloud environment.
  Compliance with this rule helps in adhering to industry standards and regulations,
  thereby enhancing organizational trust and operational resilience.
