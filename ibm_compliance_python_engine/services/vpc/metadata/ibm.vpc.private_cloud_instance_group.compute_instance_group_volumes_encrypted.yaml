title: Ensure Encryption of Volumes in Private Cloud Instance Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting volumes in private cloud instance groups is crucial to safeguarding
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures compliance
  with industry standards and regulations, thereby mitigating legal and financial
  risks associated with data exposure.
description: This rule verifies that all volumes associated with compute instance
  groups within a private cloud environment are encrypted. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, it protects data stored on volumes from being accessed by unauthorized
  entities. Encryption enhances the security posture by preventing data leakage in
  case of physical or virtual compromise and aligns with best practices for data protection
  and privacy compliance.
