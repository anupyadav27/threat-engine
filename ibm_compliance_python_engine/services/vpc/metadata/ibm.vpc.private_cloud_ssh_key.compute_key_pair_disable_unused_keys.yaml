rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_ssh_key.compute_key_pair_disable_unused_keys
title: Disable Unused SSH Keys for Enhanced VPC Security
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Unused SSH keys pose a significant security risk as they can be exploited
  by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources. Disabling these
  keys minimizes the attack surface, thereby protecting sensitive data and infrastructure
  from potential breaches. This practice is essential for maintaining robust cloud
  security and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations.
description: This rule checks for and disables SSH keys that have not been used for
  a specified period within the IBM Cloud VPC environment. By ensuring that only active
  and necessary keys are enabled, the rule helps prevent unauthorized access to critical
  systems. This enhances network security by reducing potential entry points for attackers
  and aligns with best practices in network access control. Implementing this rule
  also supports compliance with industry standards and organizational security policies
  by ensuring that access credentials are actively managed and audited.
