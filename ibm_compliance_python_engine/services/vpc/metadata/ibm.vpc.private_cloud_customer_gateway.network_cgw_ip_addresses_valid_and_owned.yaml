rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_customer_gateway.network_cgw_ip_addresses_valid_and_owned
title: Validate and Own IP Addresses for Private Cloud Customer Gateways
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that the IP addresses used by private cloud customer gateways
  are valid and owned by the customer is crucial to maintaining secure network boundaries.
  This practice prevents unauthorized access and mitigates risks such as IP spoofing,
  which can lead to data breaches or service disruptions.
description: This rule checks that all IP addresses configured for private cloud customer
  gateways within the IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are valid and owned by the customer.
  By verifying ownership, organizations can prevent unauthorized entities from using
  their network resources, thereby enhancing network security and trust. Implementing
  this rule aligns with best practices for network access control and helps ensure
  compliance with industry standards and regulations related to network security.
