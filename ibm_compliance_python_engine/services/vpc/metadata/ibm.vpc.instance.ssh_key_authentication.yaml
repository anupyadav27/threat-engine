title: Enforce SSH Key Authentication for IBM VPC Instances
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing SSH key authentication for IBM VPC instances is crucial for maintaining
  secure access control. It mitigates the risk of unauthorized access that could lead
  to potential data breaches or service disruptions, thereby protecting business operations
  and sensitive information. By eliminating reliance on passwords, it significantly
  reduces the attack surface for credential-based threats.
description: This rule ensures that all IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instances
  are configured to require SSH key authentication, rather than password-based login
  methods. The system checks if SSH keys are correctly set up for each instance, ensuring
  that access is granted only to users possessing the valid private key counterpart.
  This approach enhances security by leveraging cryptographic authentication, which
  is harder to compromise than traditional passwords. Compliance with this rule supports
  adherence to best practices for identity and access management, thus aligning with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements.
