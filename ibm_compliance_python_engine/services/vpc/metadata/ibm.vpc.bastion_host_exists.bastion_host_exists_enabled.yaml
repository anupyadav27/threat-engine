rule_id: ibm.vpc.bastion_host_exists.bastion_host_exists_enabled
title: Ensure Bastion Host is Enabled for Secure VPC Access
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling a bastion host within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) serves
  as a critical security measure to control and monitor access to your cloud resources.
  This setup mitigates the risk of unauthorized access by acting as an intermediate
  server through which all administrative traffic is routed, enhancing your network's
  security posture while supporting compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks that a bastion host is enabled within your VPC, serving
  as a controlled entry point for administrators accessing resources. By funneling
  access through a bastion host, you create a secure, auditable pathway for managing
  your cloud environment, significantly reducing the attack surface by limiting direct
  access to sensitive resources. This approach not only strengthens security by enforcing
  a single point of entry but also aids in meeting compliance requirements by ensuring
  robust access controls are in place.
