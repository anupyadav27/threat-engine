title: Ensure Subnets Span Multiple Availability Zones for Resilience
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring subnets to span multiple availability zones (AZs) enhances
  the fault tolerance and resilience of applications running on IBM Cloud. By distributing
  resources across different AZs, the risk of a single point of failure is minimized,
  ensuring continuous service availability even in the event of an AZ outage. This
  approach not only safeguards business operations but also supports regulatory compliance
  by demonstrating adherence to best practices in infrastructure resiliency.
description: This rule checks that subnets within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are
  configured to span across different availability zones. By enabling this configuration,
  organizations can achieve greater network resilience, as workloads are distributed
  across isolated locations. This setup mitigates the risk of service disruption due
  to AZ-specific failures, thus improving the overall security posture. Compliance
  with this rule aligns with industry standards for high availability and disaster
  recovery, contributing to the robustness of cloud-based environments.
