title: Restrict Sharing on IBM Cloud VPC Dedicated Hosts
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting sharing on IBM Cloud VPC Dedicated Hosts is crucial for maintaining
  a high level of data isolation and security. This restriction ensures that sensitive
  workloads are not inadvertently exposed to unauthorized entities, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. For businesses, this minimizes
  the potential for compliance issues and protects against financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks that the sharing of IBM Cloud VPC Dedicated Hosts is
  restricted to ensure that only authorized workloads can run on these resources.
  By limiting sharing, organizations can achieve better isolation of their virtual
  machines, ensuring that sensitive data and applications remain secure. This practice
  aligns with best practices for network security and access control, contributing
  to compliance with industry standards and regulations. Implementing this control
  helps organizations maintain a strong security posture by preventing unauthorized
  access to critical infrastructure.
