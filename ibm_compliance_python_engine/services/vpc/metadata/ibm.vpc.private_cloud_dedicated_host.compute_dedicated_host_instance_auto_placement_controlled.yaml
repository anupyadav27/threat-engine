title: Control Auto Placement for Dedicated Host Instances in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that auto placement of instances on dedicated hosts is controlled
  is crucial for maintaining consistent security and performance environments in IBM
  Cloud. Uncontrolled instance placement can lead to potential security vulnerabilities
  and resource contention, affecting system integrity and business operations.
description: This rule verifies that the auto placement of compute instances on dedicated
  hosts in IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is managed according to specified security
  and performance guidelines. By controlling the placement of instances, organizations
  can ensure that sensitive workloads are isolated appropriately, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access and enhancing compliance with data protection regulations.
  Furthermore, managing instance placement helps optimize resource utilization, maintaining
  the performance of critical applications and services.
