rule_id: ibm.vpc.volume.in_use
title: Ensure VPC Volumes Are Actively In Use
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Cloud VPC volumes are actively in use is crucial for
  minimizing potential security risks and optimizing resource utilization. Unused
  volumes can present a vector for unauthorized access or data leakage, which may
  lead to compliance violations and financial losses due to unnecessary storage costs.
description: This rule verifies that all volumes within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  are in use and attached to active resources. By enforcing this practice, organizations
  can reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access to data stored on
  idle volumes. Additionally, maintaining active usage aligns with best practices
  in resource management and helps ensure compliance with data protection regulations
  by preventing data from being left in unsecured states.
