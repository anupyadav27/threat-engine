rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_instance_group.compute_instance_group_uses_approved_launch_template
title: Ensure Compute Instance Groups Use Approved Launch Templates
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Utilizing approved launch templates for instance groups in the IBM Cloud
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ensures that only vetted and secure configurations are
  deployed. This minimizes the risk of security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
  and non-compliance issues, which can lead to data breaches or service disruptions,
  ultimately affecting business continuity and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that compute instance groups within a private cloud
  environment in IBM VPC are created using launch templates that adhere to organizational
  security and compliance standards. By enforcing the use of approved launch templates,
  organizations can standardize deployments, ensure consistent security settings,
  and streamline compliance with industry regulations. This approach not only enhances
  security by reducing configuration drift but also simplifies auditing processes
  and reduces the potential attack surface.
