rule_id: ibm.vpc.group.capacity_rebalance_enabled
title: Ensure Capacity Rebalance is Enabled for VPC Security Groups
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Capacity Rebalance for VPC security groups ensures optimal resource
  distribution and availability within the IBM Cloud environment. This feature helps
  in maintaining service continuity and reducing the risk of performance degradation
  or outages due to resource over-utilization. It is crucial for businesses to have
  reliable network resource management to maintain operational efficiency and compliance
  with service-level agreements.
description: This rule verifies that Capacity Rebalance is enabled for Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) security groups within IBM Cloud. Capacity Rebalance automatically manages
  resource allocation across instances, ensuring even distribution and preventing
  potential bottlenecks. By enabling this feature, organizations enhance their network's
  resilience and performance, thereby improving overall security posture. Additionally,
  this configuration aids in complying with best practices for network resource management
  and aligns with industry standards for cloud infrastructure security.
