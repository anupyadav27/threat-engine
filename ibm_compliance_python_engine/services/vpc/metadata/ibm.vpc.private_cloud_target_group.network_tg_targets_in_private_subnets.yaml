title: Ensure Network Target Group Targets Reside in Private Subnets for VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that target groups within a VPC are confined to private subnets
  is crucial for minimizing exposure to potential internet-based threats. By restricting
  network traffic to private subnets, organizations can reduce the attack surface,
  thereby preventing unauthorized access and safeguarding sensitive data. This approach
  aligns with best practices for network security, enhancing the overall security
  posture and compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that all target groups within a Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC) are associated with subnets designated as private. The check ensures that
  the traffic routed to these target groups remains within the confines of the VPC,
  avoiding exposure to the public internet. By adhering to this configuration, organizations
  can ensure robust network access control, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry
  standards and regulatory requirements for data protection and network security,
  offering a strategic advantage and operational assurance.
