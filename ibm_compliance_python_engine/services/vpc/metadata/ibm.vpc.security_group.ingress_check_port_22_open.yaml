rule_id: ibm.vpc.security_group.ingress_check_port_22_open
title: Secure Ingress on Port 22 in IBM Cloud VPC Security Groups
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Allowing unrestricted ingress on port 22 can expose virtual servers to
  unauthorized access and potential attacks, such as brute force attempts. It is crucial
  to restrict SSH access to trusted IPs to safeguard sensitive data and maintain operational
  integrity. Ensuring controlled access helps prevent unauthorized incursions, minimizing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with security standards.
description: This rule evaluates security groups within IBM Cloud Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) to identify any that allow open ingress on port 22, which is commonly
  used for SSH connections. By checking for open access, the rule aids in preventing
  unauthorized external entities from attempting to connect to instances via SSH.
  Implementing this rule strengthens security posture by ensuring only designated
  IP addresses can access port 22, aligning with best practices for network access
  control and compliance frameworks.
