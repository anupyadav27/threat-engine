rule_id: ibm.vpc.group.feature_configured
title: Ensure VPC Security Groups Have Required Features Configured
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Proper configuration of security groups within a Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC) is crucial for defining network access controls and limiting exposure to unauthorized
  access. Misconfigured or missing features in security groups can lead to vulnerabilities
  that may be exploited by attackers, potentially leading to data breaches and financial
  losses. Ensuring all necessary features are enabled supports compliance with security
  standards and reduces the risk of unauthorized network activities.
description: This rule checks that all security groups within the IBM Cloud VPC have
  the required features configured to enforce network access policies effectively.
  It ensures that security groups are set up with appropriate ingress and egress rules,
  which control the traffic allowed to and from network interfaces within the VPC.
  By verifying these configurations, the rule helps maintain a robust security posture,
  minimizes the attack surface, and aligns with best practices for network security
  and compliance requirements. Adhering to this rule aids in achieving a secure and
  compliant cloud environment.
