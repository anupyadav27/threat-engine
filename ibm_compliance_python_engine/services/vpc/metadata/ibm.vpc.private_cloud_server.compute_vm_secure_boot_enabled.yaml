title: Ensure Secure Boot is Enabled for VPC Private Cloud Server VMs
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling Secure Boot on virtual machines (VMs) within IBM Cloud's Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) ensures that each VM only runs software that is trusted by the
  Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This mitigates the risk of malicious code
  running during the boot process, thus safeguarding the integrity and security of
  the computing environment. Consequently, this measure helps protect critical business
  workloads from rootkits and other advanced persistent threats.
description: This security rule verifies that Secure Boot is enabled for virtual machines
  deployed on IBM Cloud's VPC private cloud servers. Secure Boot is a UEFI firmware
  security feature that validates the signature of all boot components, preventing
  unauthorized code from being executed. By enforcing Secure Boot, organizations enhance
  the security posture of their cloud workloads, ensuring compliance with industry
  standards and reducing the attack surface. This proactive measure is essential for
  maintaining robust compute and workload security within the cloud environment.
