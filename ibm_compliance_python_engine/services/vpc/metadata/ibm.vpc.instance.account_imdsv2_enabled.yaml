title: Enforce IMDSv2 for Enhanced Metadata Access Security in IBM VPC Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Instance Metadata Service version 2 (IMDSv2) is crucial for protecting
  against unauthorized metadata access, which can lead to exposure of sensitive data
  like instance credentials. By enforcing IMDSv2, organizations can mitigate the risk
  of server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks and ensure stronger security controls,
  thereby maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that the Instance Metadata Service version 2 (IMDSv2)
  is enabled for all virtual server instances within the IBM Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC). IMDSv2 requires session-based authentication, which significantly enhances
  the security of metadata retrieval processes by preventing unauthorized access and
  reducing the attack surface. Enforcing this rule helps organizations align with
  best practices in cloud security and adhere to compliance requirements by ensuring
  that only authenticated requests can access instance metadata.
