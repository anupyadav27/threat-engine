title: Ensure Default Security Group from Launch Wizard is Enabled
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling the default security group from the launch wizard is crucial for
  maintaining a baseline level of security for virtual private cloud (VPC) resources.
  This rule ensures that a default security policy is applied, which helps prevent
  unauthorized access and minimizes the risk of accidental exposure to the internet.
  Adhering to this practice can protect sensitive data and support compliance with
  security standards.
description: This rule checks if the default security group created by the launch
  wizard in IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is enabled. By ensuring this security
  group is active, organizations can automatically apply a predefined set of ingress
  and egress rules to new instances, thereby maintaining a consistent security posture
  across the environment. This setup enhances network security by providing foundational
  access controls and facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring
  that all VPC instances are uniformly protected.
