rule_id: ibm.vpc.securitygroup_not_used.securitygroup_not_used_enabled
title: Ensure Unused Security Groups are Disabled in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Unused security groups in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) can lead to unintended
  access control configurations, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. By ensuring
  that these unused security groups are disabled, organizations can minimize their
  attack surface and maintain a more secure cloud environment.
description: This rule checks for security groups within IBM Cloud's VPC that are
  not associated with any network interfaces. Unused security groups should be disabled
  to prevent potential misuse or misconfiguration, which could inadvertently allow
  unauthorized network traffic. Disabling these security groups helps maintain an
  organized and secure network access control strategy, contributing to overall security
  posture management and compliance with best practices for network security.
