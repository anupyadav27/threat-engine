title: Enforce NAT Blocking for Public Subnets in VPC for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Blocking NAT access for public subnets in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized external access and potential data breaches.
  By ensuring that sensitive resources remain shielded from direct internet exposure,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with malicious attacks and data exfiltration,
  thereby protecting critical business operations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks for the configuration of VPCs within IBM Cloud to ensure
  that NAT (Network Address Translation) access is blocked for subnets that are designated
  as public. By enforcing this configuration, you enhance the security posture of
  your cloud environment by preventing unintended exposure of your internal resources
  to the internet. This rule supports compliance with industry best practices for
  network security and adheres to regulatory standards that mandate strict access
  controls and data protection measures.
