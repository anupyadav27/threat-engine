title: Ensure WAF ACL is Attached to Security Groups Allowing Internet Ingress
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) to
  security groups that allow ingress from the internet is crucial for protecting applications
  from external threats. Without a WAF ACL, applications are susceptible to attacks
  such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities,
  potentially leading to data breaches and service disruptions.
description: This rule checks whether security groups in IBM Cloud Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) environments, which permit inbound traffic from the internet, have an
  associated WAF ACL. Implementing a WAF ACL adds a layer of defense by filtering
  and monitoring HTTP traffic, thereby enhancing the security posture of your cloud
  environment. By enforcing this rule, organizations can achieve better compliance
  with security standards, reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and ensure robust
  protection for their web applications against internet-based attacks.
