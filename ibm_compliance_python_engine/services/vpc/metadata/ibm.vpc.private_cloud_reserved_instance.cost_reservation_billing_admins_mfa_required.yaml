title: Enforce MFA for Cost Reservation Billing Admins in Private Cloud
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Cost Reservation Billing
  Admins is crucial to protect sensitive financial operations within IBM Cloud's Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC). Without MFA, unauthorized access to billing management could
  lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance with industry regulations.
  MFA adds an additional layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access.
description: This rule mandates that all Cost Reservation Billing Admins managing
  private cloud reserved instances within IBM VPC must be configured with Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA). The rule checks that MFA is enabled for these users, ensuring
  that access to critical billing functionalities is safeguarded by an additional
  verification step beyond just a password. Implementing MFA enhances the security
  posture by protecting against credential theft and unauthorized access, thereby
  aligning with compliance requirements and best practices for identity and access
  management.
