title: Enforce Restrictive Security Groups for VPC Private Cloud Interfaces
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing restrictive security groups for private cloud interfaces is
  crucial to minimize unauthorized access and potential security breaches. By controlling
  inbound and outbound traffic through specific rules, organizations can effectively
  reduce the attack surface, ensuring sensitive data and resources are protected against
  malicious activities and inadvertent exposure.
description: This rule evaluates the security group configurations associated with
  network interfaces in IBM Cloud VPC's private cloud. It ensures that security groups
  are defined with restrictive rules, allowing only necessary traffic to flow in and
  out of the network interfaces. By enforcing this rule, organizations can enhance
  their security posture by limiting access to critical resources, thereby adhering
  to compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Restrictive security groups help
  in preventing unauthorized access and potential data breaches, aligning with best
  practices for network security and connectivity.
