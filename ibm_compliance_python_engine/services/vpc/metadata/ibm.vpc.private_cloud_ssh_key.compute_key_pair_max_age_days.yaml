title: Enforce Maximum Age for Private Cloud SSH Key Pairs in IBM VPC
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Regularly rotating SSH key pairs is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access to your IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments. Long-lived keys can
  be compromised over time, increasing the potential for security breaches, data loss,
  and non-compliance with industry regulations. Implementing a maximum age for SSH
  key pairs ensures that keys are periodically updated, reducing attack vectors and
  improving overall security posture.
description: This security rule enforces a maximum age limit for private cloud SSH
  key pairs within the IBM VPC service. It checks the age of existing SSH keys and
  flags those that exceed the specified threshold, prompting their rotation. By ensuring
  that SSH keys are regularly updated, this rule mitigates risks associated with stale
  or potentially compromised credentials. Adhering to this practice not only strengthens
  access controls but also aligns with security best practices and regulatory requirements,
  enhancing the overall security and compliance posture of your cloud environment.
