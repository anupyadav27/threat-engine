rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_spot_instance.compute_spot_instance_no_public_ip_assigned
title: Restrict Public IP for VPC Private Cloud Spot Instances
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that VPC Private Cloud Spot Instances do not have public IP addresses
  is crucial for minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access.
  Publicly accessible instances can expose sensitive data and services to the internet,
  leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
description: This rule checks that no public IP addresses are assigned to Private
  Cloud Spot Instances within the VPC. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent
  direct exposure of instances to the internet, thereby enhancing security posture
  and ensuring compliance with best practices and industry regulations. This reduces
  the risk of external threats, such as unauthorized access and DDoS attacks, and
  aids in maintaining a secure cloud environment.
