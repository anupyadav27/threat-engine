rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_subnet.network_subnet_private_subnets_no_igw_route
title: Enforce No IGW Route for Private Subnets in IBM VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring private subnets within a VPC have no direct Internet Gateway (IGW)
  route is crucial for maintaining a secure and isolated network environment. This
  rule prevents unauthorized external access to sensitive resources, reducing the
  risk of data breaches and exposure to cyber threats.
description: This rule verifies that private subnets in IBM Cloud VPCs do not have
  routes configured to an Internet Gateway. By enforcing this restriction, the rule
  helps ensure that private resources remain isolated from the internet, thereby minimizing
  the attack surface. Adhering to this rule supports compliance with industry standards
  and best practices for network security by protecting sensitive data and workloads
  from unauthorized external access.
