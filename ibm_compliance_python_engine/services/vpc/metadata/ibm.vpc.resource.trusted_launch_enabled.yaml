rule_id: ibm.vpc.resource.trusted_launch_enabled
title: Ensure Trusted Launch is Enabled for VPC Resources
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Trusted Launch for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources is crucial
  to ensure the integrity and security of virtual machines (VMs) by protecting them
  from unauthorized modifications and potential malware injections. This not only
  safeguards the organization's sensitive data and applications but also upholds trust
  in the cloud environment, minimizing the risk of data breaches and maintaining compliance
  with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether Trusted Launch is enabled for VPC resources,
  which is an advanced security feature designed to verify the authenticity and integrity
  of the boot environment of virtual machines. By enabling Trusted Launch, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized changes to the VMs at the boot level, ensuring that only
  verified and legitimate software components are executed. This enhances the overall
  security posture of the network by preventing malicious code execution and unauthorized
  access, thereby supporting compliance with industry standards and regulatory frameworks
  such as PCI-DSS and GDPR.
