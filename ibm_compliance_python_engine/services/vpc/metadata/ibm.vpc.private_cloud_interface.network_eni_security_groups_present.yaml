title: Ensure Security Groups Attached to VPC Private Cloud Interfaces
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Attaching security groups to Network ENIs within a VPC is crucial for managing
  and restricting traffic to private cloud interfaces. This practice minimizes unauthorized
  access and potential breaches, safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining business
  continuity. Inadequate network controls can lead to vulnerabilities and increased
  risk of data exposure.
description: This rule verifies that security groups are associated with Network Elastic
  Network Interfaces (ENIs) within the IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.
  Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic
  at the instance level, providing an essential layer of security by allowing only
  legitimate traffic to access the cloud resources. Implementing this rule ensures
  that all network interfaces have the necessary security controls in place, enhancing
  compliance with industry standards and reinforcing the overall security posture
  of the cloud environment. By doing so, organizations can effectively manage network
  access, mitigate potential threats, and ensure a secure and compliant cloud infrastructure.
