title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment for Enhanced Resilience in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployments for IBM Cloud Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) resources is crucial for resilience and business continuity.
  By distributing resources across multiple zones, organizations can minimize the
  risk of service disruptions due to failures or maintenance in a single zone, ultimately
  reducing the potential for data loss and ensuring high availability.
description: This rule verifies that resources within the IBM Cloud VPC are configured
  to utilize multiple availability zones. Multi-AZ deployments distribute workloads
  and data across diverse geographic locations, enhancing fault tolerance and availability.
  Implementing this configuration is essential for meeting compliance requirements
  related to redundancy and disaster recovery. By leveraging Multi-AZ, organizations
  can ensure that their applications remain operational even in the event of zone-specific
  failures, thereby safeguarding business operations and customer trust.
