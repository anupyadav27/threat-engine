title: Restrict Serial Console Access on IBM Cloud VPC Servers
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Restricting serial console access to virtual machines in IBM Cloud VPC
  environments is critical to maintaining a secure infrastructure. Unrestricted access
  may expose sensitive data and system controls to unauthorized users, posing a risk
  of data breaches and operational disruption. By limiting this access, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized modifications and enhance their overall security posture.
description: This security rule ensures that serial console access to compute virtual
  machines within the IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is restricted to authorized
  personnel only. It checks for configurations that allow unrestricted access and
  flags them for review. Enforcing restricted access helps prevent unauthorized users
  from gaining direct control over the VM, reducing the risk of malicious activity.
  This control is aligned with compliance frameworks that emphasize access management
  and strengthens the security of workloads running in the cloud by safeguarding critical
  administrative interfaces.
