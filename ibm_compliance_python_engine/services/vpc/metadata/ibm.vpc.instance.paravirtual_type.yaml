rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.paravirtual_type
title: Enforce Paravirtual Type for VPC Instances for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that VPC instances utilize a paravirtualization type is critical
  for maintaining a consistent and controlled environment. This type of virtualization
  enhances the security posture by providing an additional layer of abstraction between
  the hardware and the operating system, reducing potential vulnerabilities. It also
  helps in achieving operational efficiency and can have a positive impact on performance
  and resource management.
description: This rule verifies that all instances within a Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC) are configured to use a paravirtualization type, which is essential for enhancing
  security and ensuring optimal network performance. By enforcing this configuration,
  the rule helps prevent unauthorized access and data breaches by minimizing the attack
  surface. Furthermore, using paravirtualization supports compliance with industry
  standards and best practices, as it ensures that instances are running in a secure
  and isolated manner, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to malicious activities.
