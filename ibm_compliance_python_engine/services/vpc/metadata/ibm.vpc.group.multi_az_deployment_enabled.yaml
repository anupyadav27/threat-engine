rule_id: ibm.vpc.group.multi_az_deployment_enabled
title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment is Enabled for VPC Security Groups
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ deployment for VPC security groups enhances the resilience
  and availability of your cloud infrastructure by distributing resources across multiple
  Availability Zones (AZs). This mitigates the risk of downtime and data loss in the
  event of an AZ failure, ensuring business continuity and maintaining application
  uptime.
description: This rule verifies that your IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security
  groups are configured to support Multi-AZ deployment. By enabling this configuration,
  you ensure that your network resources are distributed across multiple availability
  zones within a region, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. This setup not
  only enhances your security posture by minimizing the impact of an AZ-specific failure
  but also aligns with best practices for high availability and disaster recovery
  strategies. Compliance with this rule aids in meeting organizational and regulatory
  requirements for robust network security and availability.
