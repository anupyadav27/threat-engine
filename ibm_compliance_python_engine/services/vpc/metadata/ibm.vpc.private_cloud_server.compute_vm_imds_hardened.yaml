title: Harden VM Instance Metadata Service for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Hardening the VM Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is crucial for preventing
  unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, which could lead to information disclosure
  or privilege escalation. By securing IMDS, organizations can protect critical data
  and maintain the integrity of their cloud infrastructure, thereby minimizing potential
  business disruptions and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) on IBM
  Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) private cloud servers is properly hardened. By
  restricting access to the IMDS, the rule ensures that only authorized processes
  can interact with it, significantly reducing the risk of data exposure or manipulation.
  Hardening the IMDS is a vital step in enhancing the overall security posture of
  compute resources, aligning with compliance frameworks and best practices for cloud
  security. This measure supports adherence to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, where
  protecting data integrity and confidentiality is mandatory.
