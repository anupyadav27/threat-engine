rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.paas_instance_disk_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for IBM Cloud PaaS Instance Disks in VPC
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that disks associated with PaaS instances are encrypted is critical
  to protect sensitive data at rest from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  Encryption mitigates risks associated with data exposure in events such as theft,
  unauthorized access, or loss, thereby helping organizations maintain trust and compliance
  with data protection regulations and industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that disks attached to IBM Cloud PaaS instances within
  a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols.
  By enforcing encryption at rest, this rule enhances data security by ensuring that
  even if physical or unauthorized logical access occurs, the data remains unintelligible
  without the proper encryption keys. This capability supports compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate strong data protection measures,
  and helps organizations safeguard sensitive information against increasing cyber
  threats.
