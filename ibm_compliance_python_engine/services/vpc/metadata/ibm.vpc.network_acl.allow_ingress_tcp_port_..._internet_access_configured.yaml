title: Secure Ingress TCP Port Access in Network ACL for IBM Cloud VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: This rule is crucial for ensuring that ingress TCP port access is securely
  configured to prevent unauthorized internet traffic from reaching your IBM Cloud
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources. Misconfigured network ACLs can lead to potential
  vulnerabilities, exposing critical applications to unauthorized access, which can
  result in data breaches or service disruptions, impacting business operations and
  credibility.
description: This rule checks the configuration of network access control lists (ACLs)
  applied to your IBM Cloud VPC to ensure that ingress TCP port access is correctly
  configured to restrict unnecessary exposure to the internet. By verifying that only
  approved and necessary traffic is allowed, this rule helps in minimizing the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential attacks. Implementing this rule supports compliance
  with industry security standards and enhances your overall cloud security posture
  by ensuring that network traffic is effectively controlled and monitored.
