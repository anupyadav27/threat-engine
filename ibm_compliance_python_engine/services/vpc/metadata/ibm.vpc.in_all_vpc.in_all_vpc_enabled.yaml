title: Ensuring 'In All VPC' Configuration is Enabled for IBM Cloud VPCs
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling the 'In All VPC' configuration enhances network security by ensuring
  that all Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) have consistent access controls. This reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, providing a unified
  security posture across your cloud environment. It is crucial for maintaining compliance
  with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks that the 'In All VPC' setting is enabled across all
  VPCs within your IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring this configuration, network
  access control policies are uniformly applied, preventing discrepancies that could
  lead to security vulnerabilities. It streamlines the management of network security
  policies, facilitating easier audits and compliance with standards such as ISO 27001
  and GDPR. Consistent application of this setting is a proactive measure in fortifying
  your cloud's defense against unauthorized network access.
