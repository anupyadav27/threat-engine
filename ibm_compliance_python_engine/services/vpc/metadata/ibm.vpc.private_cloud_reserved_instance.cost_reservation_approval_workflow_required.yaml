rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_reserved_instance.cost_reservation_approval_workflow_required
title: Enforce Cost Reservation Approval Workflow for Enhanced Network Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing a cost reservation approval workflow for private cloud reserved
  instances is crucial to maintain control over resource allocation and expenditure.
  This measure helps prevent unauthorized or unplanned provisioning, which can lead
  to financial inefficiencies and potential security vulnerabilities within the network.
description: This rule ensures that any request to reserve instances within the IBM
  Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) requires an approval workflow to be completed.
  By enforcing such a workflow, organizations can ensure that only authorized personnel
  can make decisions that affect network resources and costs. This not only aids in
  maintaining budgetary controls but also aligns with best practices for network security
  and compliance, reducing the risk of resource misuse and enhancing overall security
  posture.
