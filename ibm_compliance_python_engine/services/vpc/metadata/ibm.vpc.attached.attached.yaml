rule_id: ibm.vpc.attached.attached
title: Ensure VPC Resources Are Properly Attached for Network Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are properly
  attached is crucial for maintaining secure network configurations. Misconfigured
  or unattached resources can lead to unexpected exposure to external threats, reducing
  overall network security and potentially impacting business operations. Proper attachment
  helps to enforce security policies and ensures that resources are reachable only
  through intended and secure pathways.
description: This rule checks whether all resources within a VPC are correctly attached
  to the network infrastructure, such as subnets, gateways, and security groups. By
  verifying these attachments, the rule helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures
  that data flows are restricted according to security policies, thereby minimizing
  exposure to vulnerabilities. Additionally, maintaining proper attachments supports
  compliance with industry standards by enforcing structured and controlled network
  access, ultimately contributing to a robust security posture.
