rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_block_storage.compute_disk_snapshots_not_public
title: Ensure VPC Block Storage Snapshots are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Publicly accessible compute disk snapshots pose a significant security
  risk by potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access. Ensuring that
  snapshots are not public helps protect intellectual property, personal data, and
  compliance with data protection regulations, thereby preventing data breaches and
  financial losses.
description: This rule checks that all compute disk snapshots within the IBM Cloud
  VPC private cloud block storage are configured to prevent public access. By ensuring
  that snapshots are not publicly accessible, organizations can safeguard sensitive
  information and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of their data. This practice
  aligns with best practices for storage and database security, enhancing the security
  posture of cloud environments and supporting compliance with regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA.
