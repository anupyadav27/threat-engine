title: Ensure Critical Vulnerabilities Are Absent in Private Cloud Images
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that private cloud images are free from critical vulnerabilities
  is vital for maintaining a secure cloud environment. Critical vulnerabilities can
  be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services, potentially
  leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. By scanning
  and remediating these vulnerabilities, organizations can safeguard their network
  infrastructure and maintain operational integrity.
description: This rule mandates that all private cloud images within the IBM Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) environment undergo a vulnerability assessment to ensure no
  critical vulnerabilities are present. The assessment checks for known vulnerabilities
  that could expose the system to severe threats. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  enhance their security posture, reducing the risk of exploitation and aligning with
  security compliance standards. Implementing regular vulnerability scans and addressing
  critical findings help in demonstrating due diligence and adherence to industry
  best practices.
