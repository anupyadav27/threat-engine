title: Ensure CMK Configured for Compute Disk in IBM VPC Block Storage
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring a Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encryption of block storage
  in IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ensures a higher level of data security
  by giving organizations control over encryption keys. This enhances data protection
  against unauthorized access and aligns with regulatory compliance requirements,
  mitigating risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.
description: This rule verifies that Compute Disks within IBM VPC's Block Storage
  have a Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) configured. By using a CMK, organizations
  retain control over the lifecycle and access of their encryption keys, which enhances
  data security by preventing unauthorized use or access. This practice is crucial
  for maintaining compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which
  require stringent data protection measures. Implementing CMK provides an additional
  layer of security by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data
  stored in the cloud.
