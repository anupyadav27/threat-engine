title: Enforce Least Privilege on IBM VPC Private Cloud Endpoint Policies
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in network endpoint policies
  within an IBM VPC ensures that only necessary permissions are granted, reducing
  the attack surface and limiting potential security breaches. This rule is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining business continuity by preventing
  unauthorized access to critical cloud resources.
description: This rule evaluates the configuration of network endpoint policies associated
  with IBM VPC private cloud endpoints to ensure they adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. By verifying that only essential permissions and access rights are granted,
  it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. This practice not
  only enhances the overall security posture but also aligns with industry compliance
  standards by enforcing strict access controls. Regularly reviewing and updating
  these policies helps maintain a secure cloud environment and supports organizational
  security objectives.
