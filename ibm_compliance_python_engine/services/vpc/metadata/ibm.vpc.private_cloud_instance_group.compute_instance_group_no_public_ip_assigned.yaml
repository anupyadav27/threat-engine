rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_instance_group.compute_instance_group_no_public_ip_assigned
title: Restrict Public IP Assignment to Private Cloud Instance Groups
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that compute instance groups within a private cloud do not have
  public IP addresses assigned is crucial for maintaining a secure and isolated network
  environment. Public IP exposure can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks, compromising the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive business data.
description: This rule checks for the assignment of public IP addresses to compute
  instance groups within a virtual private cloud (VPC) to enforce strict network isolation.
  By preventing public IP assignments, the rule mitigates the risk of external threats
  accessing internal resources, thus enhancing the security posture of the cloud environment.
  Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry best practices and regulatory
  requirements for network access control and data protection, ensuring that only
  authorized internal traffic can interact with these instances.
