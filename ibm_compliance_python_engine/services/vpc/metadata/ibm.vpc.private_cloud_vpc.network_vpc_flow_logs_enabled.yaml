title: Ensure VPC Flow Logs are Enabled for Private Cloud VPCs
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling VPC Flow Logs is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the traffic
  that flows through your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This capability enhances security
  by providing visibility into network activity, helping to detect anomalous behavior
  and potential threats. It also aids in compliance efforts by offering detailed records
  of all traffic, which can be invaluable during audits or investigations.
description: This rule checks whether VPC Flow Logs are activated for private cloud
  VPCs within IBM Cloud. By ensuring that flow logs are enabled, organizations can
  maintain a comprehensive audit trail of all network interactions, which is essential
  for identifying unauthorized access attempts and monitoring data leakage. This logging
  capability not only bolsters security posture by enabling proactive threat detection
  but also supports compliance with various regulatory frameworks that require detailed
  logging of network activity.
