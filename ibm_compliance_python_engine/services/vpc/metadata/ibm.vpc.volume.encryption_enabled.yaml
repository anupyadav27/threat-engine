rule_id: ibm.vpc.volume.encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption is Enabled for VPC Volumes
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for VPC volumes is crucial to protect sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By encrypting data at rest,
  organizations safeguard against data leaks and comply with regulatory standards,
  thereby maintaining customer trust and avoiding costly legal penalties.
description: This rule verifies that all volumes within the IBM Cloud Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) are configured with encryption enabled. Encryption at rest ensures that
  data stored on volumes is automatically encrypted using IBM-managed keys, enhancing
  the security of data against unauthorized access. This practice not only fortifies
  data protection but also aligns with compliance mandates such as GDPR, HIPAA, and
  PCI-DSS, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties and enhancing overall data
  privacy.
