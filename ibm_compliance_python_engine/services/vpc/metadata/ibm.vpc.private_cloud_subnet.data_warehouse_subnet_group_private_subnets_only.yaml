rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_subnet.data_warehouse_subnet_group_private_subnets_only
title: Ensure Data Warehouse Subnet Groups Use Private Subnets Only
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting data warehouse subnet groups to private subnets is essential
  for minimizing exposure to the internet and protecting sensitive data. By ensuring
  that these subnets are not publicly accessible, organizations can significantly
  reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, which can have
  severe business and compliance impacts.
description: This security rule verifies that all subnets within a Data Warehouse
  Subnet Group on IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are configured as private
  subnets. Private subnets enhance security by preventing unauthorized external access
  and ensuring that data flows through controlled and monitored network paths. Adhering
  to this configuration helps organizations maintain compliance with industry standards
  and best practices by ensuring that sensitive workloads are isolated from public
  internet threats.
