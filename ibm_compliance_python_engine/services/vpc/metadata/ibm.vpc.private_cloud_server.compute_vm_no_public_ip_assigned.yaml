rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.compute_vm_no_public_ip_assigned
title: Enforce Private IP Usage for VPC Compute Instances
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) compute instances do not have
  public IP addresses is crucial for minimizing exposure to unauthorized access and
  potential cyber threats. By limiting network access to private IPs, organizations
  can significantly reduce the attack surface, safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining
  the integrity of internal systems.
description: This rule verifies that compute virtual machines within the IBM Cloud
  VPC do not have public IP addresses assigned. By enforcing private IP usage, it
  ensures that these instances remain accessible only within the private network,
  which strengthens network security by preventing direct exposure to the internet.
  This practice aligns with industry best practices for secure network architecture
  and helps in maintaining compliance with regulations that mandate strict control
  over public network access.
