rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.detailed_monitoring_enabled
title: Ensure Detailed Monitoring is Enabled for VPC Instances
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling detailed monitoring on IBM Cloud VPC instances is critical for
  maintaining a robust security posture and operational efficiency. This practice
  allows for the collection of granular performance and operational metrics, which
  are essential for timely detection of anomalies and potential security threats.
  Additionally, detailed monitoring supports compliance with industry regulations
  by ensuring that comprehensive audit logs are available for review.
description: This rule checks that detailed monitoring is enabled for all instances
  within your IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). By activating detailed monitoring,
  administrators gain access to enhanced metrics such as CPU utilization, network
  traffic, and disk activity, allowing for quicker identification and response to
  performance issues or security incidents. This proactive approach to monitoring
  not only strengthens the security of cloud resources but also aids in meeting compliance
  standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR by ensuring that all relevant system activities
  are logged and auditable.
