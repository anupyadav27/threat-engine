rule_id: ibm.vpc.security_group.securitygroup_common_ports_restricted_enabled
title: Restrict Common Ports in IBM VPC Security Groups for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Limiting access to common ports in IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security
  groups reduces the attack surface, minimizing potential exposure to unauthorized
  access attempts. By restricting these ports, organizations can better protect sensitive
  resources from malicious actors and inadvertent data breaches, ensuring business
  continuity and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule ensures that IBM VPC security groups are configured to restrict
  access to commonly targeted ports, such as HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22).
  By checking the security group configurations, this rule helps ensure that only
  necessary traffic is permitted, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of
  your cloud environment. Implementing such restrictions aligns with best practices
  and compliance requirements, helping organizations to mitigate risks associated
  with unauthorized network access.
