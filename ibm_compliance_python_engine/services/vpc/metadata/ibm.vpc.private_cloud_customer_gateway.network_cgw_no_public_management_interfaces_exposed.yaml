rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_customer_gateway.network_cgw_no_public_management_interfaces_exposed
title: 'Secure Network Gateways: No Public Management Interface Exposure'
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: The exposure of public management interfaces on customer gateways poses
  significant security risks, including unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By ensuring these interfaces are not publicly accessible, organizations can prevent
  malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities, thereby protecting sensitive resources
  and maintaining trust with clients.
description: This rule verifies that no public management interfaces are exposed on
  private cloud customer gateways within your IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  environment. By restricting public access, this rule enhances the security of your
  network infrastructure, minimizes the attack surface, and aligns with best practices
  for network access control. Compliance with this rule is crucial for maintaining
  robust network security, ensuring that management operations are accessible only
  from secure, internal networks, thereby reducing exposure to external threats.
