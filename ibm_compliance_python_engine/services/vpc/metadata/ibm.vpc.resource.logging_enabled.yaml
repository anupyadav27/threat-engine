rule_id: ibm.vpc.resource.logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud VPC Resources
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring logging is enabled for IBM Cloud VPC resources is critical for
  maintaining visibility into network activities and resource access patterns. This
  enhances the ability to detect unauthorized activities and respond to potential
  security incidents promptly. Furthermore, comprehensive logging supports audit requirements
  and compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for resources within the
  IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. By enabling logging, organizations
  can capture detailed information about network traffic, configuration changes, and
  access attempts. This not only strengthens security by providing insights into operations
  and potential anomalies but also aids in meeting compliance mandates such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which require detailed records of data access and processing activities.
  Regularly monitored logs are invaluable for forensic investigations and can help
  mitigate risks by enabling quick responses to security incidents.
