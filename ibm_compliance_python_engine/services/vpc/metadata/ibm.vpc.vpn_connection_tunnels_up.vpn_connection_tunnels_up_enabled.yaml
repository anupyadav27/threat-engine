rule_id: ibm.vpc.vpn_connection_tunnels_up.vpn_connection_tunnels_up_enabled
title: Ensure VPN Connection Tunnels are Actively Monitored and Enabled
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Monitoring and enabling VPN connection tunnels is crucial for maintaining
  secure and reliable network communications within your IBM Cloud environment. Active
  VPN tunnels ensure that data is encrypted and securely transmitted, preventing unauthorized
  access and data breaches. By maintaining open and monitored tunnels, organizations
  can ensure business continuity and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that VPN connection tunnels within your IBM Cloud Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) are actively monitored and enabled. It ensures that all VPN
  tunnels are operational, providing secure connectivity between on-premises networks
  and cloud resources. By verifying the status of VPN tunnels, organizations can detect
  and address potential connectivity issues swiftly, reducing the risk of data interception
  and enhancing overall network security posture. Compliance with this rule aids in
  meeting industry standards for secure data transmission and network access control.
