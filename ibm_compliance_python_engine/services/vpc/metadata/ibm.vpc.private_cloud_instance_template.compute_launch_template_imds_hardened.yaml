title: Harden IMDS Access in IBM VPC Private Cloud Instance Templates
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Securing the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive metadata, which could lead to data breaches or unauthorized
  resource manipulation. By hardening IMDS access, organizations reduce their exposure
  to potential attacks, thereby safeguarding their cloud infrastructure and maintaining
  business continuity.
description: This rule ensures that the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) for IBM VPC
  private cloud instance templates is configured with enhanced security settings.
  The configuration involves restricting IMDS access to only trusted instances or
  applications, minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized retrieval
  of sensitive instance metadata. Implementing this measure strengthens network security,
  aids in compliance with industry standards, and aligns with best practices for cloud
  security posture management by enforcing strict access controls and reducing potential
  vulnerabilities.
