title: Enforce Least Privilege for VPC Spot Instance Profiles
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Adhering to the principle of least privilege for Compute Spot Instance
  Profiles in IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is crucial to minimize the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring that Spot Instances
  are granted only the permissions necessary for their specific tasks, organizations
  can significantly reduce their attack surface and safeguard sensitive information,
  ultimately protecting their business operations and reputation.
description: This rule checks that Compute Spot Instance Profiles in IBM Cloud's Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) are configured following the least privilege principle. It ensures
  that permissions assigned to Spot Instances are strictly necessary for their intended
  function, preventing excessive access rights that could be exploited by malicious
  actors. By enforcing this policy, organizations can achieve improved security postures,
  mitigate risks associated with privilege escalation, and align with compliance frameworks
  that emphasize access control, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
