rule_id: ibm.vpc.volume.public_access_blocked
title: Block Public Access to IBM VPC Volumes for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that IBM VPC volumes are not publicly accessible is critical for
  safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access. Public exposure of storage
  volumes can lead to data breaches, which can result in severe reputational damage
  and financial loss for businesses. By blocking public access, organizations can
  mitigate the risk of data theft and comply with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks that all IBM VPC volumes are configured to block public
  access, ensuring that only authorized entities within the private network have access.
  By implementing this control, businesses can prevent potential data leaks and unauthorized
  data manipulation. Blocking public access to volumes enhances the security posture
  by restricting data exposure to the public internet, thus aligning with compliance
  frameworks that demand stringent access controls.
