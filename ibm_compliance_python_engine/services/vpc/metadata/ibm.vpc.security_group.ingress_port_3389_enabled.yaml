rule_id: ibm.vpc.security_group.ingress_port_3389_enabled
title: Restrict Ingress Traffic on Port 3389 in VPC Security Groups
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Allowing ingress traffic on port 3389, which is used for Remote Desktop
  Protocol (RDP), can expose your virtual servers to unauthorized access and potential
  exploitation. If this port is enabled without proper security controls, it increases
  the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized remote access, leading to potential
  data breaches and system compromise.
description: This rule checks whether ingress traffic on port 3389 is enabled in IBM
  Cloud VPC security groups. By default, leaving this port open can serve as a vector
  for unauthorized access attempts to virtual machines. Disabling or properly securing
  this port enhances your network security by reducing the attack surface. Implementing
  this rule helps achieve compliance with best practices for network access control
  and ensures a more secure configuration of your cloud resources.
