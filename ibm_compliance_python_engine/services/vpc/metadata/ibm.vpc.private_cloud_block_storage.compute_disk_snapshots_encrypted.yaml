rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_block_storage.compute_disk_snapshots_encrypted
title: Encryption of Compute Disk Snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Encrypting compute disk snapshots is critical for protecting sensitive
  data in transit and at rest. Without encryption, snapshots can be vulnerable to
  unauthorized access and data breaches, leading to potential financial losses and
  reputational damage. Ensuring that all disk snapshots are encrypted helps maintain
  data integrity and compliance with industry regulations and standards.
description: This rule checks whether compute disk snapshots within the IBM Cloud
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are encrypted. Encryption of disk snapshots is a best
  practice for safeguarding data against unauthorized access and ensuring that sensitive
  information remains confidential. By implementing this rule, organizations can enhance
  their security posture, protect against data exfiltration, and comply with various
  regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Encrypted disk snapshots
  also support a secure data recovery process, ensuring that only authorized users
  can access the data.
