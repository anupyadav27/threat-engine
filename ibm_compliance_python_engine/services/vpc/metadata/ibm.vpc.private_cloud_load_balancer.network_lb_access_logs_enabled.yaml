rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_load_balancer.network_lb_access_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Network Load Balancer Access Logs are Enabled in IBM VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling access logs for network load balancers is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into traffic patterns and identifying potential security threats. Access
  logs provide detailed records of connections, which are essential for auditing,
  troubleshooting, and compliance with security standards. Without these logs, organizations
  may be blind to unauthorized access attempts and anomalies, increasing the risk
  of data breaches and non-compliance.
description: This rule checks whether access logging is enabled for network load balancers
  in IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments. By ensuring that logging is activated,
  organizations can capture comprehensive data about incoming and outgoing requests,
  which aids in forensic analysis and monitoring. This practice not only enhances
  the security posture by enabling timely detection and response to suspicious activities
  but also supports compliance with regulations that mandate detailed logging of network
  activities.
