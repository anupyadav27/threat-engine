rule_id: ibm.vpc.volume.snapshots_exists
title: Ensure Existence of Snapshots for VPC Volumes
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Regularly creating snapshots of VPC volumes is crucial for data protection
  and business continuity. Snapshots serve as point-in-time backups that can be used
  to restore data in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or disaster. Ensuring
  the existence of these snapshots helps mitigate the risk of data loss and supports
  recovery processes, minimizing potential downtime and financial impact.
description: This rule checks whether snapshots exist for volumes within the IBM Cloud
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service. By verifying the presence of snapshots, the
  rule ensures that critical data stored in VPC volumes is backed up regularly, enhancing
  the organization's resilience against data loss incidents. Implementing this practice
  aligns with best-practice guidelines for backup configuration and contributes to
  compliance with industry standards for disaster recovery and data protection. It
  also improves the overall security posture by providing a reliable method for data
  recovery.
