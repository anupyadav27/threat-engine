rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.compute_vm_ssh_password_auth_disabled
title: Disable SSH Password Authentication for VPC Private Cloud Servers
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Disabling SSH password authentication is crucial for minimizing unauthorized
  access risks and mitigating brute force attacks. By enforcing key-based authentication,
  organizations strengthen their security posture and protect sensitive data on virtual
  private cloud servers, thereby reducing potential business disruptions and compliance
  violations.
description: This rule ensures that SSH password authentication is disabled on compute
  virtual machines within the IBM Virtual Private Cloud. The rule checks the server
  configurations to verify that only SSH key-based authentication is permitted. By
  implementing this security measure, organizations can prevent unauthorized access
  attempts and reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. This practice aligns with
  industry standards for securing cloud environments and aids in achieving compliance
  with regulatory frameworks that mandate stringent access controls.
