rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_instance_template.compute_launch_template_instance_profile_least_privilege
title: Ensure Least Privilege for VPC Compute Launch Template Profiles
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for compute launch templates
  in IBM Cloud ensures that components within the virtual private cloud (VPC) have
  only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes the potential
  attack surface by restricting unnecessary access, thereby reducing the risk of data
  breaches and unauthorized actions that could compromise business operations.
description: This rule checks that all instance profiles associated with compute launch
  templates in the VPC are configured with the least privilege necessary. By verifying
  and enforcing minimal access rights, the rule helps to protect sensitive data and
  critical infrastructure from internal and external threats. Compliance with this
  rule supports adherence to industry standards and regulatory requirements, enhancing
  the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
