title: Enforce IMDSv2 for Enhanced Instance Metadata Security in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing IMDSv2 for instance metadata access significantly enhances
  security by reducing the risk of unauthorized data retrieval. By mandating IMDSv2,
  businesses can mitigate vulnerabilities associated with metadata interception, thereby
  protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with security standards.
description: This rule ensures that all Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instances utilize
  Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2), which requires session-based authentication
  and mitigates the risks of open metadata endpoints. By enforcing this configuration,
  the rule protects against potential metadata service exploitation, such as Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. Compliance with this rule aligns with best practices
  for network security and access control, thus supporting organizational compliance
  with industry standards and regulations.
