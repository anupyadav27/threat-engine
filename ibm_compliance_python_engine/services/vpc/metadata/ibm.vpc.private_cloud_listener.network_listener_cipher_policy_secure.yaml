title: Ensure Secure Cipher Policy for VPC Private Cloud Listener
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing a secure cipher policy for network listeners is crucial for
  protecting sensitive data in transit against interception and unauthorized access.
  Weak or outdated cipher suites can expose communications to vulnerabilities such
  as eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to data breaches
  and non-compliance with industry standards.
description: This security rule verifies that the cipher policy configured for Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) private cloud listeners adopts strong, modern encryption protocols.
  By enforcing secure cipher suites, this rule ensures that the data exchanged over
  the network is encrypted using robust algorithms, thereby mitigating risks associated
  with weaker encryption methods. Adhering to this rule enhances the overall security
  posture of the cloud environment and aids in meeting compliance requirements such
  as PCI DSS and HIPAA, which mandate the use of secure encryption for data in transit.
