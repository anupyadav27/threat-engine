rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.uses_single_eni
title: Enforce Single ENI Usage for Enhanced VPC Instance Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Limiting a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance to a single Elastic Network
  Interface (ENI) minimizes the attack surface by controlling network entry points.
  This reduces the complexity of network configurations and potential vulnerabilities,
  ensuring that unauthorized network access is mitigated. By adhering to this rule,
  organizations can maintain a streamlined and secure network topology, enhancing
  overall security posture while optimizing resource management.
description: This rule verifies that each VPC instance is configured with a single
  ENI, ensuring simplified network management and reducing exposure to potential threats.
  By restricting instances to one ENI, organizations can enforce tighter control over
  network traffic paths and access points, which is crucial for maintaining a robust
  security posture. Implementing this rule aids compliance with security policies
  that demand strict network segmentation and access control, helping businesses to
  meet regulatory requirements and industry standards.
