rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_instance_template.compute_launch_template_user_data_no_secrets
title: Ensure No Secrets in Compute Launch Template User Data for VPC
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Storing secrets, such as passwords or API keys, in the Compute Launch Template
  User Data poses a significant security risk as they can be exposed to unauthorized
  users, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access. Ensuring that
  user data does not contain sensitive information is crucial for maintaining the
  integrity and confidentiality of your cloud resources, thus mitigating the risk
  of exploitation.
description: This security rule checks the user data associated with IBM VPC private
  cloud instance templates to ensure that no sensitive information, such as passwords,
  API keys, or other secrets, is embedded within the data. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can enhance their security posture by preventing the exposure of secrets
  to unauthorized parties. This practice aligns with industry standards for data protection
  and compliance requirements, reducing the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access
  to critical cloud resources. Implementing this rule helps maintain a secure and
  compliant virtual private cloud environment.
