title: Ensure Private Cloud Route Tables Are Configured Correctly
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Proper configuration of network route tables in IBM Cloud VPC environments
  is crucial for maintaining secure and efficient network traffic flow. Misconfigured
  route tables can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or inefficient routing,
  impacting the organization's security posture and operational efficiency.
description: This rule ensures that private cloud route tables in IBM VPCs are configured
  to enforce network access control policies effectively. It checks for correct route
  definitions that align with security best practices, preventing unauthorized traffic
  and ensuring only permissible communication paths are established. By adhering to
  this rule, organizations can enhance their network security, optimize connectivity,
  and meet compliance requirements related to network access control.
