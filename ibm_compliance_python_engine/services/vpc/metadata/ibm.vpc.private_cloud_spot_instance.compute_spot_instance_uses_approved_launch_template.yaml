rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_spot_instance.compute_spot_instance_uses_approved_launch_template
title: Enforce Approved Launch Templates for VPC Spot Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Compute Spot Instances use approved launch templates is vital
  for maintaining security compliance and adhering to organizational policies. These
  templates standardize configurations such as network settings and security groups,
  reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access or
  resource vulnerabilities. By using approved templates, organizations can ensure
  consistent application of security controls, thus safeguarding sensitive data and
  resources.
description: This rule verifies that any Compute Spot Instance within the IBM Cloud
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment utilizes a pre-approved launch template.
  The approved templates include predefined configurations that align with the organization's
  security and compliance standards, such as specific network access controls, encryption
  settings, and instance permissions. Enforcing this rule enhances security by preventing
  unauthorized or insecure instance configurations, thereby reducing the risk of data
  breaches and ensuring alignment with regulatory compliance requirements like GDPR
  or HIPAA.
