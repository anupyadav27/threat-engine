title: Ensure VM Root Volume Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys
severity: critical
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Encrypting the compute VM root volume using customer-managed encryption
  keys (CMEK) ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access. This
  encryption strategy allows organizations to maintain control over the keys used
  to encrypt their data, providing an additional layer of security and compliance
  with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether the root volume of compute virtual machines
  (VMs) in the IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is encrypted using customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK). By utilizing CMEK, organizations can manage their encryption
  keys through IBM Key Protect or other supported services, ensuring that data is
  protected at rest and only accessible by authorized users. This practice not only
  strengthens data security but also aids in meeting compliance standards such as
  GDPR and HIPAA by demonstrating control over data protection mechanisms.
