rule_id: ibm.vpc.floating_ip.ip_unassigned
title: Unassigned Floating IPs in IBM VPC Should Be Monitored
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Unassigned floating IPs within your IBM VPC environment can lead to potential
  security vulnerabilities and misuse of resources. Without proper monitoring and
  control, unassigned IPs may be accidentally or maliciously assigned to unauthorized
  systems, risking data exposure or unauthorized access. Managing these resources
  ensures better network hygiene and aligns with best practices for cloud infrastructure
  management.
description: This rule checks for floating IPs within your IBM Cloud Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) that are not currently assigned to any resource. Floating IPs are static
  IP addresses that can be associated with instances to maintain consistent network
  addressing. Unassigned floating IPs can be a security risk as they may be inadvertently
  exposed or used improperly. Regular audits and management of these IPs improve your
  security posture by minimizing attack surfaces, ensuring compliance with network
  security policies, and optimizing resource utilization.
