rule_id: ibm.vpc.group.health_check_enabled
title: Enable Health Checks for VPC Security Group Configurations
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling health checks for VPC security groups ensures that network resources
  are continuously monitored for availability and performance issues. This proactive
  approach helps to maintain optimal network security posture by detecting and addressing
  potential vulnerabilities before they impact business operations.
description: This security rule verifies that health checks are enabled for Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) security groups within IBM Cloud. By ensuring health checks
  are active, administrators can receive timely alerts about network performance and
  availability, allowing for quick remediation of issues. This practice not only enhances
  the security and reliability of cloud resources but also aids in maintaining compliance
  with industry standards that mandate regular monitoring of network components.
