title: Ensure Valid TLS Certificates for Private Cloud Load Balancers
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that network load balancers in the IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC) have valid TLS certificates is crucial for encrypting data in transit, which
  safeguards sensitive information from interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  This practice not only enhances security but also maintains customer trust and meets
  regulatory compliance requirements, thereby protecting business reputation and reducing
  the risk of legal penalties.
description: This rule verifies that all private cloud load balancers within an IBM
  VPC have valid TLS certificates attached. A valid TLS certificate ensures that the
  data exchanged between clients and servers is encrypted, protecting against unauthorized
  access and data breaches. By enforcing this security measure, organizations can
  avoid potential vulnerabilities associated with unencrypted data transmission, thereby
  aligning with industry standards and regulatory compliance frameworks such as PCI
  DSS and GDPR. Regularly updated certificates also help in maintaining continuous
  security posture and operational integrity.
