rule_id: ibm.vpc.security_group.default_security_group_traffic_restricted
title: Restrict Default Security Group Traffic in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting traffic in the default security group is crucial to mitigate
  unauthorized access and potential security breaches. By limiting open ports and
  protocols, organizations can minimize the attack surface, thereby reducing the risk
  of intrusion and ensuring compliance with security policies. This proactive approach
  is essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data
  within the virtual private cloud (VPC).
description: This rule verifies that the default security group within an IBM Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) is configured to restrict inbound and outbound traffic effectively.
  It checks for the presence of overly permissive rules that might allow unrestricted
  access. By enforcing stricter rules, this control enhances network security by ensuring
  that only necessary and specific traffic is allowed, thus supporting compliance
  with industry-standard security frameworks and regulations. Implementing these restrictions
  helps prevent inadvertent data exposure and aligns with best practices in network
  access control.
