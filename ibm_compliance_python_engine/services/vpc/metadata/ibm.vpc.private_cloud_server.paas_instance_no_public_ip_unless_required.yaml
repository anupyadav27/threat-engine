rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.paas_instance_no_public_ip_unless_required
title: Restrict Public IP for PaaS Instances in Private Cloud Servers
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Assigning a public IP address to PaaS instances unnecessarily exposes them
  to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Minimizing public exposure by restricting public IPs to only those instances that
  require it enhances the overall security posture and reduces the attack surface.
description: This rule verifies that PaaS instances within IBM VPC private cloud servers
  do not have a public IP address unless explicitly required for operational purposes.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent unintended public access to sensitive
  resources, thereby reducing the likelihood of cyber threats. This practice aligns
  with security best practices and regulatory compliance requirements by ensuring
  only essential network access is permitted, thereby safeguarding data integrity
  and privacy.
