title: Ensure Managed Disks are Enabled for IBM VPC Resources
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling managed disks on IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources enhances
  data integrity and availability by leveraging IBM's resilient infrastructure. Managed
  disks automate storage management tasks, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption.
  This setup is crucial for maintaining compliance with industry standards and ensuring
  business continuity.
description: This rule checks that all virtual machines within an IBM VPC are configured
  to use managed disks, which are automatically replicated to ensure high availability
  and data durability. Managed disks provide built-in redundancy, eliminating the
  need for users to manually configure disk replication and backups. By enforcing
  the use of managed disks, organizations can strengthen their security posture, streamline
  compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, and optimize storage management
  operations within their cloud environment.
