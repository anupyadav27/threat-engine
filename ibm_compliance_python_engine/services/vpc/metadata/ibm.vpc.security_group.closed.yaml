rule_id: ibm.vpc.security_group.closed
title: Enforce Closed Security Groups for Enhanced VPC Isolation
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring security groups within an IBM Cloud VPC are closed by default
  is vital for minimizing unauthorized access. Closed security groups act as a safeguard,
  allowing only explicitly permitted traffic, thus reducing the attack surface and
  potential exposure of sensitive resources. This approach supports robust network
  security and aligns with best practices for protecting cloud environments.
description: This rule checks that VPC security groups do not allow any inbound or
  outbound traffic by default, ensuring they are in a 'closed' state. By enforcing
  closed security groups, you ensure that all traffic is explicitly defined, thereby
  preventing unintended exposure to external threats. This configuration enhances
  the security posture by minimizing potential entry points for attackers and aids
  in achieving compliance with stringent security standards by ensuring network access
  is tightly controlled.
