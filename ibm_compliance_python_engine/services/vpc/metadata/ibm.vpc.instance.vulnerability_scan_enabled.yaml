rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.vulnerability_scan_enabled
title: Ensure Vulnerability Scanning is Enabled for VPC Instances
severity: medium
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling vulnerability scanning on VPC instances is crucial for identifying
  and mitigating potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious
  actors. This proactive approach helps protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity
  of your workloads, reducing the risk of breaches that could lead to significant
  business and reputational harm.
description: This rule checks whether vulnerability scanning is enabled for instances
  within the IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Enabling vulnerability scanning
  allows for continuous assessment of the instance's security posture by identifying
  vulnerabilities such as outdated software and misconfigurations. This practice not
  only enhances the overall security of your cloud environment but also aids in compliance
  with industry standards and regulations by ensuring that security risks are promptly
  identified and addressed. By implementing this rule, organizations can maintain
  a robust security posture and ensure that their cloud resources are protected against
  emerging threats.
