title: Limit Ingress and Egress Rules in IBM VPC Security Groups
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Excessive ingress and egress rules in security groups can lead to increased
  risk exposure by broadening the attack surface of your virtual private cloud. By
  limiting the number of rules, you can better manage and control network traffic,
  reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access or data breaches. Streamlined rules
  also facilitate easier management and auditing, ensuring compliance with security
  best practices and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule identifies security groups within IBM VPC that have an unusually
  high number of ingress and egress rules configured. By evaluating and potentially
  reducing these rules, organizations can strengthen their network access control
  mechanisms. Limiting the number of rules helps to prevent misconfigurations that
  could lead to potential vulnerabilities. It also aids in ensuring compliance with
  security frameworks by enforcing strict network segmentation and access control,
  thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
