title: Enforce NACL Restrictions on Public Subnets in IBM Cloud VPC
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing Network Access Control List (NACL) restrictions on public
  subnets within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is crucial for preventing unauthorized
  access and mitigating potential security threats. By controlling inbound and outbound
  traffic at the subnet level, businesses can significantly reduce the risk of data
  breaches and ensure compliance with stringent security standards. This rule is critical
  as it directly impacts the safeguarding of sensitive data and the overall security
  posture of the cloud environment.
description: This security rule verifies that all public subnets within an IBM Cloud
  VPC are configured with appropriate Network Access Control List (NACL) restrictions.
  The rule ensures that access control policies are applied to regulate traffic flow,
  thereby enhancing the security and integrity of data traversing the public subnet.
  Enforcing NACL restrictions helps in minimizing exposure to potential threats by
  restricting unauthorized traffic and providing a structured approach to network
  security. This practice not only bolsters the security framework but also aids in
  meeting compliance requirements for data protection and privacy.
