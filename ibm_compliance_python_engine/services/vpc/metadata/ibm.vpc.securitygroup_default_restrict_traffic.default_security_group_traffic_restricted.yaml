title: Enforce Restrictions on Default Security Group Traffic in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting traffic in the default security group of IBM Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) is vital to safeguarding network resources from unauthorized access
  and potential threats. Failure to restrict traffic can lead to inadvertent exposure
  of critical services, increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data
  access, which can have significant business and legal repercussions.
description: This rule ensures that traffic in the default security group of an IBM
  VPC is restricted to prevent unauthorized access. The check verifies that the default
  security group rules are configured to allow only necessary traffic, thereby minimizing
  the attack surface. By implementing these restrictions, organizations can enhance
  their network security posture, align with best practices, and meet industry compliance
  standards such as PCI DSS and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls.
