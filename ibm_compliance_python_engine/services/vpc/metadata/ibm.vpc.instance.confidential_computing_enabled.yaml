rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.confidential_computing_enabled
title: Enforce Confidential Computing on IBM VPC Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Confidential Computing on Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instances
  ensures that sensitive data is protected even during processing, minimizing risks
  from potential threats like insider attacks or compromised host systems. It enhances
  trust and security for businesses handling sensitive workloads by providing hardware-based
  encryption, thereby complying with stringent data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that Confidential Computing is enabled on IBM Cloud
  VPC instances, leveraging Intel SGX or similar technologies to encrypt data in use.
  By ensuring this setting is active, organizations can protect sensitive data from
  unauthorized access during processing, thus maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
  This feature not only enhances the overall security posture by reducing the attack
  surface but also assists in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA
  by ensuring that data is encrypted at all times, including during computation.
