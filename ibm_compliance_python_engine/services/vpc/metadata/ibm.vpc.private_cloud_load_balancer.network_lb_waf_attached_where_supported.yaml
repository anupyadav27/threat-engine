title: Ensure WAF is Attached to Network Load Balancers for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to network load balancers provides
  an essential layer of security that helps protect applications from common web exploits
  and vulnerabilities. By inspecting incoming traffic and blocking or alerting on
  suspicious activity, a WAF mitigates risks associated with data breaches and service
  disruptions, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule checks whether a Web Application Firewall (WAF) is attached
  to network load balancers within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment, where
  supported. Implementing a WAF helps shield web applications from attacks such as
  SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
  attacks. By ensuring a WAF is in place, organizations enhance their security posture,
  reduce the attack surface, and align with compliance standards that mandate robust
  network security controls.
