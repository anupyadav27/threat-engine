title: Ensure VPC Block Storage Disk Encryption at Rest is Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting compute disk storage at rest is critical for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that even if physical
  or virtual disks are accessed without authorization, the data remains unreadable
  and secure. This practice mitigates risks related to data leakage and complies with
  industry standards and regulations for data protection.
description: This rule verifies that the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) block storage
  in IBM Cloud has encryption enabled for data at rest. By ensuring encryption is
  activated, it protects the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on block
  storage devices. Implementing this control enhances the overall security posture
  by safeguarding against unauthorized data exposure and aligning with compliance
  frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. The encryption process utilizes robust
  algorithms to render data inaccessible without proper decryption keys, thus providing
  a strong layer of security.
