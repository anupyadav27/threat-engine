title: Ensure TLS for Network Target Group Health Checks Where Supported
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling TLS for network target group health checks is crucial for maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged during these checks. Without
  TLS, sensitive information could be intercepted by malicious actors, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. Implementing TLS also demonstrates
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements, reinforcing trust
  with customers and stakeholders.
description: This security rule verifies that TLS is enabled for health checks in
  network target groups within IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments,
  wherever such support is available. By enforcing TLS, data transmitted during health
  checks is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized interception and ensuring secure
  communication. This measure not only enhances the overall security posture of the
  network but also aligns with compliance frameworks that mandate secure data transmission
  practices.
