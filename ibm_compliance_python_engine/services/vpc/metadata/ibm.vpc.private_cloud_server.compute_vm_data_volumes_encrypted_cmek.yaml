title: Ensure Encryption of Compute VM Data Volumes with CMEK in VPC
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting VM data volumes using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
  enhances data security by giving organizations control over encryption keys. This
  approach protects sensitive data at rest from unauthorized access and meets regulatory
  compliance requirements, reducing the risk of data breaches and associated financial
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether compute VM data volumes in IBM Cloud's Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) are encrypted using CMEK, ensuring that sensitive data is protected
  with keys managed by the customer rather than the cloud provider. By implementing
  CMEK, organizations maintain control over key management, enabling better alignment
  with their security policies and compliance mandates. Encrypting data at rest with
  CMEK also facilitates compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  thereby enhancing the organization's overall security posture.
