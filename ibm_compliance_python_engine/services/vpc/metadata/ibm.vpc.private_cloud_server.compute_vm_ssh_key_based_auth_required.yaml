title: Enforce SSH Key-Based Authentication for VPC Private Cloud Servers
severity: high
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enforcing SSH key-based authentication is crucial for securing virtual
  machines (VMs) within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by eliminating the risks associated
  with password-based logins. This rule mitigates the possibility of unauthorized
  access due to weak or compromised passwords, ensuring that only users with a valid
  SSH key can access the server. This enhances the organization's security posture
  and protects sensitive workloads from potential breaches.
description: This security rule verifies that all compute virtual machines (VMs) within
  the IBM Cloud VPC are configured to require SSH key-based authentication, reinforcing
  robust access controls. By mandating the use of cryptographic keys instead of passwords,
  the rule reduces the attack surface, preventing brute force attacks and unauthorized
  access attempts. Compliance with this rule aligns with industry best practices and
  regulatory standards, enhancing the overall security and integrity of cloud infrastructure
  and workloads.
