title: Ensure Private DNS is Enabled for VPC Private Cloud Endpoints
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Private DNS for VPC private cloud endpoints enhances security
  by ensuring that domain name resolutions are restricted to internal network queries,
  reducing exposure to external threats. This measure helps in preventing DNS spoofing
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources and data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that private DNS is enabled for network endpoints
  within the IBM Cloud VPC where such features are supported. Enabling private DNS
  ensures that all DNS resolutions for cloud endpoints are handled internally, thus
  preventing external DNS queries that could lead to data leakage or interception
  by malicious actors. Implementing this control is a key component of a robust network
  access control strategy, aligning with industry best practices for cloud security
  and aiding in compliance with regulations that mandate secure configurations for
  cloud environments.
