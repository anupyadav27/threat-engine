title: Enforce Strong Encryption for VPN IKE Phase in IBM VPC
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring strong encryption algorithms for the IKE phase of VPN connections
  is crucial for protecting data integrity and confidentiality during transmission
  over networks. Weak encryption can be exploited by attackers, leading to unauthorized
  data access and potential data breaches. Strong encryption supports regulatory compliance
  and protects sensitive information, fostering trust with customers.
description: This rule mandates the use of strong encryption algorithms for the Internet
  Key Exchange (IKE) phase of VPN connections within IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
  It checks for the implementation of robust encryption standards, such as AES-256,
  which are less susceptible to cryptographic attacks. By enforcing strong encryption,
  this rule enhances the security posture of the network, ensuring that sensitive
  data is securely transmitted across cloud environments. Adhering to this rule aids
  in achieving compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53,
  which require strong cryptographic controls to safeguard information.
