rule_id: ibm.vpc.resource.watcher_enabled
title: Ensure IBM VPC Resource Watcher is Enabled for Enhanced Monitoring
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling the Watcher on IBM VPC resources is crucial for maintaining a
  vigilant security posture. It provides continuous monitoring and real-time alerts
  on changes to critical network configurations, helping to prevent unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Businesses benefit by ensuring compliance with best
  practices and regulatory standards, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents.
description: This rule verifies that the Watcher service is enabled on IBM Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) resources. The Watcher service monitors changes to network configurations,
  such as security group rules and access control lists, providing visibility into
  unauthorized or unexpected modifications. By enabling the Watcher, organizations
  can detect and respond swiftly to security threats, thereby improving their overall
  security posture. Additionally, this practice supports compliance with industry
  standards by maintaining an audit trail of changes and enhancing the integrity of
  network configurations.
