rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.management_compliance_enabled
title: Ensure Management Compliance is Enabled for VPC Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling management compliance on VPC instances is crucial for maintaining
  a secure and compliant cloud environment. This rule ensures that instances adhere
  to organizational and regulatory standards, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. By enforcing management compliance, businesses can
  protect sensitive data, maintain customer trust, and avoid costly compliance violations.
description: This rule checks whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instances on IBM
  Cloud have management compliance enabled. It ensures that all instances are configured
  to meet predefined security and compliance policies, such as encryption standards,
  access controls, and monitoring practices. Enabling this feature enhances the overall
  security posture by automating compliance checks, thus assisting organizations in
  aligning with industry regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. By implementing
  this rule, organizations can streamline their compliance efforts, mitigate security
  risks, and ensure that all VPC instances are securely managed and monitored.
