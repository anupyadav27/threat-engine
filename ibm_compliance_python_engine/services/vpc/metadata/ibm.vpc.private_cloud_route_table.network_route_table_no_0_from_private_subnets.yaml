rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_route_table.network_route_table_no_0_from_private_subnets
title: Restrict Default Route Table Entries from Private Subnets
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that private subnets do not have default route table entries is
  crucial for preventing unintended exposure of sensitive resources to public networks.
  This rule helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data by enforcing
  strict boundaries between private and public network zones, reducing the risk of
  unauthorized access and data breaches.
description: This rule checks that default route table entries (i.e., those with destination
  0.0.0.0/0) are not present in the route tables associated with private subnets within
  a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Implementing this control prevents private subnet
  traffic from being routed directly to the internet, thereby enhancing the security
  posture by minimizing the attack surface of cloud resources. By adhering to this
  practice, organizations align with security compliance standards that mandate the
  segregation of network traffic and the protection of private data.
