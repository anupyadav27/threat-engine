rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.paas_instance_ssh_password_auth_disabled
title: Ensure SSH Password Authentication is Disabled for Paas Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Disabling SSH password authentication on PaaS instances significantly reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access due to password-based attacks, such as brute force
  or credential stuffing. By leveraging key-based authentication, organizations enhance
  their security posture, ensuring that only users with the correct cryptographic
  keys can access critical resources.
description: This rule verifies that SSH password authentication is disabled on PaaS
  instances within the IBM Cloud VPC, ensuring that only key-based authentication
  is permitted. By enforcing this security measure, organizations can protect against
  common attack vectors that exploit weak or compromised passwords. This practice
  not only strengthens the security of the cloud environment but also helps meet compliance
  requirements by adhering to recommended security frameworks and best practices for
  network access control.
