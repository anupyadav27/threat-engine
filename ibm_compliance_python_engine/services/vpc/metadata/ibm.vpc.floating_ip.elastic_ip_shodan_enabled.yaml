rule_id: ibm.vpc.floating_ip.elastic_ip_shodan_enabled
title: Ensure Elastic IP Shodan Visibility is Disabled for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Disabling Elastic IP Shodan visibility is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  discovery and potential exploitation of your cloud resources. When Elastic IPs are
  visible on Shodan, they can be easily indexed and targeted by malicious actors,
  increasing the risk of cyber-attacks. By ensuring Shodan visibility is disabled,
  organizations can reduce the attack surface, thereby protecting sensitive data and
  maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule audits the configuration of Elastic IPs within IBM Cloud VPC
  to ensure that they are not exposed to Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected
  devices. By verifying that Elastic IPs are not indexed by Shodan, this rule helps
  improve security by reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access and reconnaissance
  activities. Implementing this control aligns with best practices for network security
  and access control, contributing to compliance with industry standards such as ISO
  27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
