rule_id: ibm.vpc.security_group.default_ingress_restriction
title: Enforce Default Ingress Restrictions for Security Groups in VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing default ingress restrictions on security groups is crucial
  for minimizing unauthorized access to virtual private cloud (VPC) resources. By
  restricting default ingress traffic, organizations protect their cloud environments
  from potential threats and reduce the attack surface, ultimately safeguarding sensitive
  data and ensuring business continuity.
description: This rule checks that security groups within the IBM Cloud VPC have default
  ingress rules set to restrict incoming traffic. By enforcing these restrictions,
  only explicitly permitted traffic can access resources, thereby enhancing the overall
  security posture. This practice aligns with industry best practices and compliance
  standards, ensuring that only necessary and legitimate traffic reaches your infrastructure,
  thus reducing the risk of exploitation from malicious entities.
