title: Restrict Permissions for Cost Reservation Purchases in VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting permissions for purchasing cost reservations is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized financial commitments within your cloud environment. By ensuring
  only authorized users can make such purchases, organizations can maintain budgetary
  control and prevent unexpected expenditures, which helps in aligning with financial
  governance policies.
description: This rule checks that permissions to purchase cost reservations for private
  cloud reserved instances within the IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are restricted
  to authorized personnel only. It ensures that access controls are correctly configured,
  limiting the ability to make reservation purchases to a select group of users. This
  restriction not only enhances security by reducing the risk of unauthorized financial
  transactions but also aids in maintaining compliance with organizational policies
  regarding financial governance and access management.
