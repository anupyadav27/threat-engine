rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_instance_template.compute_launch_template_root_volume_encrypted_by_default
title: Ensure Default Encryption for VPC Compute Launch Template Root Volumes
severity: critical
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting root volumes by default in VPC compute launch templates is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data at rest. This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  data access, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining
  customer trust. Failing to encrypt volumes could lead to data breaches, resulting
  in significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all root volumes within IBM Cloud VPC compute
  launch templates are encrypted by default. Ensuring encryption at rest enhances
  the security posture by protecting data from unauthorized access during storage.
  This practice aligns with industry standards and compliance requirements, such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection measures. By enforcing encryption,
  organizations can enhance data confidentiality and integrity, thus reducing potential
  vulnerabilities associated with unencrypted storage.
