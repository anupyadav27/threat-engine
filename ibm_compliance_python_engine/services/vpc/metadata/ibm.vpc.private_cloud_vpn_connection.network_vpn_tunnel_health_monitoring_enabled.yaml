title: Ensure VPN Tunnel Health Monitoring is Enabled for Private Cloud Connections
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling VPN tunnel health monitoring is crucial for maintaining the reliability
  and security of your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) connections. It allows for the
  early detection of tunnel failures or performance issues, thereby minimizing downtime
  and ensuring continuous, secure access to cloud resources. This proactive approach
  aids in sustaining business operations and safeguarding sensitive data from potential
  exposure due to connectivity lapses.
description: This rule verifies that health monitoring is enabled for VPN tunnels
  used within IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service. By continuously monitoring
  the health of VPN tunnels, organizations can detect and respond to issues promptly,
  ensuring optimal performance and availability of network resources. This capability
  enhances security by ensuring that any disruptions or anomalies in the VPN connection
  are identified and mitigated swiftly, thus maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of data in transit. Additionally, enabling tunnel health monitoring supports compliance
  with industry standards and best practices for network security management.
