title: Enforce CMEK Encryption for VPC Private Cloud Images
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting compute images using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
  ensures that sensitive data remains protected by using keys that are under the direct
  control of the customer. This enhances data privacy and security, mitigating the
  risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Implementing CMEK helps businesses
  comply with stringent regulatory requirements and industry standards for data protection.
description: This rule verifies that all private cloud images within the IBM Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys. It checks
  if the images are secured with encryption keys controlled by the customer, rather
  than default platform-managed keys. By enforcing CMEK, organizations gain greater
  control over the cryptographic keys used to encrypt their data, enhancing data security
  measures and aligning with compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA. This approach
  not only bolsters the security posture but also ensures that sensitive workloads
  adhere to best practices for encryption at rest.
