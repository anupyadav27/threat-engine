title: Ensure VPC Load Balancer Logging to IBM COS for Audit Compliance
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for VPC load balancers to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)
  is crucial for maintaining an audit trail of access and configuration changes. This
  logging capability helps in identifying unauthorized access attempts, understanding
  traffic patterns, and complying with industry regulations and internal security
  policies.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for virtual private cloud
  (VPC) load balancers, directing logs to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) for audit
  purposes. By ensuring that audit logs are collected, stored, and managed appropriately,
  organizations can monitor and analyze security events, detect potential breaches,
  and maintain a historical record of system activities. This practice not only enhances
  the security posture by providing insights into anomalous behavior but also supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring that audit trails are available
  for review and reporting.
