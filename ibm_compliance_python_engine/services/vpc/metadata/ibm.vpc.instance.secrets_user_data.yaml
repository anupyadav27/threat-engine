rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.secrets_user_data
title: Secure User Data Handling for VPC Instances
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that sensitive information such as secrets and credentials are
  not stored in user data for VPC instances is crucial to maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of your cloud infrastructure. Unauthorized access to such data can
  lead to significant security breaches, compromising the entire VPC environment and
  violating compliance requirements.
description: This rule verifies that no sensitive information, including secrets or
  credentials, is embedded within the user data of VPC instances. It helps prevent
  unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information by enforcing best practices for
  secret management, such as using secure vaults or secret management services. Compliance
  with this rule supports adherence to regulatory standards and enhances overall security
  posture by minimizing the attack surface associated with exposed secrets.
