title: Enable Trust Boundaries for Endpoint Connections in VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling trust boundaries for endpoint connections in IBM Cloud Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) is vital to ensure secure communication between resources. This
  rule helps prevent unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining the integrity of sensitive
  information. By defining clear trust boundaries, organizations can enhance their
  security posture and ensure compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether trust boundaries are enabled for endpoint connections
  in IBM Cloud VPC. Trust boundaries act as a security measure that restricts access
  to endpoint gateways based on predefined security policies, ensuring that only trusted
  and authenticated sources can connect. Enabling this feature enhances network security
  by mitigating potential attack vectors and limiting exposure to malicious activities.
  It also supports compliance with regulatory requirements by enforcing stringent
  access controls and ensuring that connections adhere to organizational security
  policies.
