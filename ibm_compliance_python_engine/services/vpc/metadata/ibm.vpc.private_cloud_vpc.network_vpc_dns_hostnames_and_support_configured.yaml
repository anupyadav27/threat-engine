title: Ensure DNS Hostnames and Support Configured in Private Cloud VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Proper configuration of DNS hostnames and support within a Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) is crucial to maintain network integrity and operational efficiency.
  Enabling DNS hostname resolution facilitates seamless communication between instances
  and other resources, reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could lead to data
  breaches or service disruptions. This configuration also plays a vital role in achieving
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements, enhancing the overall
  security posture of the organization.
description: This rule verifies that DNS hostnames and support are correctly configured
  for instances within a private cloud VPC. By enabling DNS support, instances can
  resolve hostnames to IP addresses, ensuring reliable internal and external communications.
  This configuration not only aids in network management and troubleshooting but also
  fortifies security by preventing unauthorized access attempts and misrouting of
  data. Additionally, it supports compliance with security frameworks like ISO 27001
  and NIST, which require robust network access control mechanisms.
