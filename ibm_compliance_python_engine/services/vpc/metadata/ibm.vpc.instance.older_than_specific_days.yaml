rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.older_than_specific_days
title: Audit VPC Instances Older Than Specified Duration
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Regularly auditing virtual private cloud (VPC) instances that have been
  running for an extended period is critical to maintaining a secure and efficient
  cloud environment. Instances that exceed a certain age threshold may be running
  outdated software or configurations, leading to vulnerabilities that could be exploited
  by malicious actors. By identifying and assessing these older instances, organizations
  can ensure they are compliant with security policies and minimize potential risks.
description: This rule checks for VPC instances that have been active longer than
  a specified number of days, helping organizations identify potentially outdated
  or neglected resources. Monitoring the age of instances allows for timely updates,
  patching, and decommissioning of resources that no longer meet current security
  standards. Implementing this rule enhances network security by reducing the attack
  surface and ensuring compliance with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
  Regular audits of instance age support proactive management of cloud resources,
  optimizing both security and operational efficiency.
