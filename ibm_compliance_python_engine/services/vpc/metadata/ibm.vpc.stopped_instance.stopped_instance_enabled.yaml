rule_id: ibm.vpc.stopped_instance.stopped_instance_enabled
title: Ensure VPC Stopped Instances Are Properly Managed
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Stopped instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) can pose a security
  risk if not properly managed, as they may retain sensitive configurations or data
  that can be exploited upon restart. Properly managing stopped instances helps in
  minimizing the attack surface and ensuring compliance with data governance policies,
  thereby reducing potential security breaches and unauthorized access.
description: This rule evaluates whether stopped instances in an IBM Cloud VPC are
  appropriately managed to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. By enforcing
  policies on stopped instances, organizations can ensure that these resources are
  not inadvertently restarted without proper authorization, thus maintaining a secure
  and controlled cloud environment. Regularly monitoring and managing stopped instances
  enhances security posture by ensuring compliance with internal security standards
  and regulatory requirements, ultimately reducing the risk of data leaks or unauthorized
  access.
