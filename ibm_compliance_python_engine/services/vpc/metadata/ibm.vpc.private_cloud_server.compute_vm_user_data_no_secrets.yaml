rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.compute_vm_user_data_no_secrets
title: Enforce No Secrets in Compute VM User Data for Enhanced Security
severity: high
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that no sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords,
  is stored in user data for VMs is crucial to maintaining a secure cloud environment.
  Mismanagement of secrets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches, impacting
  both operational integrity and business reputation.
description: This rule checks that user data associated with virtual machines within
  IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) does not contain sensitive information like
  passwords, API keys, or other secrets. By enforcing this rule, organizations can
  prevent accidental exposure of critical credentials, thereby enhancing the overall
  security posture. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to best practices
  in cloud security, aligning with standards like ISO 27001 and SOC 2, and reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access to cloud resources.
