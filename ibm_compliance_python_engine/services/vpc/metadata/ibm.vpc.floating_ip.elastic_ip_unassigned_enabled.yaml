rule_id: ibm.vpc.floating_ip.elastic_ip_unassigned_enabled
title: Ensure Unassigned Elastic IPs are Disabled in VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Unassigned Elastic IPs within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) can pose a
  security risk as they may be inadvertently used for unauthorized access or malicious
  activities. By controlling the assignment of Elastic IPs, organizations can reduce
  the attack surface, thus enhancing their security posture and minimizing potential
  exposure to threats.
description: This rule checks for Elastic IPs within the VPC that are not currently
  assigned to any resources. Ensuring that unassigned Elastic IPs are disabled prevents
  unauthorized use and potential security breaches. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can maintain better control over their network resources, ensuring that only assigned
  and necessary IPs are active. This practice aligns with network security best practices
  and helps maintain compliance with security standards by reducing unnecessary exposure
  to the internet.
