rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_instance_template.compute_launch_template_no_public_ip_default
title: Enforce Private Cloud Instance Templates Without Public IPs
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that compute instances launched within a Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC) do not have public IP addresses by default is critical for minimizing exposure
  to unauthorized access. Public IPs can be a vector for cyberattacks, leading to
  potential data breaches and compliance violations. Organizations must enforce this
  rule to maintain robust network security and safeguard sensitive data.
description: This rule checks that the default setting for compute launch templates
  in a private cloud instance does not allow public IP addresses. By enforcing this
  configuration, organizations limit the exposure of their cloud resources to the
  public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.
  Adhering to this rule not only enhances security posture but also aids in meeting
  compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent access controls
  to protect sensitive information.
