rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.imdsv2_enabled
title: Ensure IMDSv2 is Enabled for IBM Cloud VPC Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) is crucial for safeguarding
  instance metadata from unauthorized access. It mitigates the risk of metadata service
  exploitation, which could lead to information disclosure and potential security
  breaches. For businesses, maintaining secure access to instance metadata ensures
  compliance with industry standards and protects sensitive data from threats.
description: This rule checks whether IMDSv2 is enabled for instances within an IBM
  Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). IMDSv2 enhances security by requiring a session-based
  token for metadata retrieval, thus preventing unauthorized access from external
  sources. This security measure supports compliance with regulatory frameworks by
  ensuring that sensitive metadata is not exposed to potential attackers. Compliance
  with IMDSv2 enhances your cloud infrastructure's overall security posture by reducing
  the attack surface associated with metadata services.
