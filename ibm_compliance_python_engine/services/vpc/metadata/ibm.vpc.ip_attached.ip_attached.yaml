rule_id: ibm.vpc.ip_attached.ip_attached
title: Ensure IPs are Attached to IBM VPC Resources
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that IP addresses are correctly attached to IBM Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) resources is essential for maintaining network availability and security.
  Misconfigured or unattached IPs can lead to potential network vulnerabilities, service
  disruptions, and unauthorized access. Additionally, proper IP management helps in
  maintaining compliance with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all IP addresses within an IBM VPC are properly
  attached to their respective resources, such as virtual servers or load balancers.
  By ensuring IPs are attached, the rule helps prevent potential network misconfigurations
  that could expose resources to unauthorized access or lead to service outages. This
  practice enhances network security by ensuring that all network traffic is routed
  through intended pathways and helps organizations adhere to compliance standards
  by maintaining accurate network configurations.
