title: Ensure Least Privilege for VPC Instance Group Profiles
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for compute instance group
  profiles minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation of
  resources. By restricting instance profiles to only the necessary permissions, organizations
  can reduce their attack surface and mitigate the impact of compromised credentials
  or insider threats, thereby enhancing overall cloud security posture.
description: This rule ensures that compute instance groups within a private cloud
  on IBM VPC are assigned instance profiles with only the permissions required for
  their operation. It checks whether the instance profiles adhere to the least privilege
  principle by limiting permissions to those strictly necessary for their functions.
  Enforcing least privilege not only bolsters security by minimizing potential attack
  vectors but also aligns with compliance requirements that mandate minimal access
  rights as a security best practice. This practice helps in maintaining a secure
  and compliant cloud environment, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions on cloud
  resources.
