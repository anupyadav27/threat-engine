title: Enforce TLS 1.2 or Higher for VPC Network Listeners
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that network listeners in IBM Cloud VPC environments use a minimum
  of TLS 1.2 is crucial for maintaining secure communications. TLS 1.2 provides enhanced
  encryption and security features compared to its predecessors, protecting sensitive
  data from potential eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Adhering to this
  standard helps organizations meet compliance requirements and protect their reputation
  by securing their network communications.
description: This security rule mandates that all network listeners configured within
  an IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment utilize at least TLS 1.2 for
  secure communications. By enforcing this minimum version of the TLS protocol, the
  rule mitigates vulnerabilities found in earlier versions, such as TLS 1.0 and 1.1,
  which are susceptible to various cryptographic attacks. Implementing TLS 1.2 or
  higher enhances data integrity and confidentiality, aligning with industry best
  practices and regulatory standards. This measure ensures a robust security posture
  by safeguarding network traffic against cyber threats, thereby supporting organizational
  compliance and risk management strategies.
