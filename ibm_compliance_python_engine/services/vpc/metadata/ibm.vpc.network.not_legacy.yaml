rule_id: ibm.vpc.network.not_legacy
title: Enforce Modern Network Configurations in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that virtual private cloud (VPC) networks do not utilize legacy
  configurations is crucial for maintaining robust security. Legacy network settings
  may expose the environment to vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to
  unauthorized access or data breaches. By eliminating outdated configurations, organizations
  can enhance their security posture and adhere to modern compliance standards.
description: This rule checks for the presence of legacy configurations within IBM
  Cloud's VPC network resources, ensuring that all settings align with current security
  best practices. It assesses network parameters to identify deprecated protocols
  or configurations that may pose security risks. By enforcing non-legacy configurations,
  this rule helps mitigate potential threats, supports regulatory compliance, and
  bolsters the overall security architecture of the cloud environment. Transitioning
  to modern network setups not only reduces vulnerabilities but also optimizes network
  performance and reliability.
