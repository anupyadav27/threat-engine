rule_id: ibm.vpc.network_acl.networkacl_unused_enabled
title: Ensure Unused Network ACLs Are Disabled in IBM VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Disabling unused network access control lists (ACLs) is crucial for maintaining
  a secure network posture in IBM Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.
  Unused ACLs can be overlooked during security audits, potentially leaving vulnerabilities
  open for exploitation. By ensuring that only actively managed and necessary ACLs
  are enabled, organizations can minimize the attack surface and enhance their compliance
  with security best practices.
description: This rule checks for the presence of unused network ACLs within IBM Cloud's
  VPC and ensures they are disabled. An unused ACL is one that is not actively attached
  to any subnets or is redundant. Disabling such ACLs helps prevent unauthorized access
  and mitigates potential misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
  Implementing this rule supports compliance with security frameworks that require
  strict control over network access permissions and helps maintain a streamlined
  and manageable network security infrastructure.
