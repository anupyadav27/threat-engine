title: Ensure VPCs Span Multiple Regions for Enhanced Resilience
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) across different regions enhances
  the resilience and availability of your cloud resources, mitigating the risk of
  regional failures impacting your operations. This approach supports business continuity
  and disaster recovery plans by ensuring that critical workloads have geographic
  redundancy and are not confined to a single point of failure.
description: This security rule checks if VPCs are configured across different geographic
  regions within IBM Cloud. By deploying resources in multiple regions, organizations
  can minimize the risk of service disruption due to regional outages or natural disasters.
  This configuration is essential for maintaining high availability, reducing latency
  for global users, and ensuring compliance with regulations that require geographic
  data distribution. Implementing VPCs across regions also aligns with best practices
  for network security and connectivity, enabling stronger access control and data
  sovereignty management.
