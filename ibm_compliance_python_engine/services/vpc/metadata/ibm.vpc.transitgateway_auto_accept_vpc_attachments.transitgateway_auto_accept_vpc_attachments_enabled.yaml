title: Ensure Auto Acceptance of VPC Attachments on Transit Gateway is Enabled
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling auto acceptance of VPC attachments on an IBM Cloud Transit Gateway
  streamlines connectivity and reduces the potential for human error in network configuration.
  It ensures that Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) can quickly and securely connect to
  the transit gateway without manual intervention, which is crucial for maintaining
  seamless operations and avoiding potential connectivity lapses that could impact
  business continuity.
description: This rule checks if the auto acceptance feature for VPC attachments on
  a Transit Gateway is enabled within the IBM Cloud environment. By configuring transit
  gateways to automatically accept VPC attachments, organizations can enhance their
  network security posture by minimizing the risk of misconfigurations and unauthorized
  access. Additionally, it aids in maintaining compliance with best practices for
  network access control by ensuring that VPC connections are handled in a consistent
  and secure manner, supporting efficient and automated network management.
