title: Restrictive Security Groups for VPC Compute Launch Templates
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing restrictive security groups for compute launch templates ensures
  that only necessary traffic is allowed, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. This practice is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and confidentiality of sensitive data and supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether the security groups associated with private
  cloud instance templates in IBM VPC are configured to allow only essential traffic.
  By enforcing restrictive security group policies, the rule helps reduce the attack
  surface and limits exposure to potential threats. Ensuring that security groups
  are properly configured aligns with best practices for network security and enhances
  the overall security posture by preventing unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
  Compliance with this rule supports adherence to regulatory frameworks such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate stringent access controls.
