rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance.patch_compliance_enabled
title: Ensure Patch Compliance Enabled for IBM VPC Instances
severity: medium
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling patch compliance on IBM VPC instances is crucial for mitigating
  vulnerabilities within the infrastructure. Regular patching ensures that known security
  holes are addressed promptly, reducing the risk of exploitation and potential data
  breaches. This practice helps maintain system integrity and aligns with industry
  standards for security and compliance.
description: This rule verifies that IBM VPC instances have patch compliance enabled,
  ensuring they receive regular security updates and patches. By enabling patch compliance,
  organizations can automatically manage and deploy patches, reducing the attack surface
  by keeping systems up-to-date with the latest security enhancements. This process
  not only strengthens the security posture but also supports compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data protection measures.
