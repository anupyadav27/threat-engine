rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_image.compute_image_not_publicly_shared
title: Restrict Public Sharing of VPC Private Cloud Images for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that compute images within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are
  not publicly shared is crucial to maintaining data integrity and protecting against
  unauthorized access. Publicly shared images can be exploited by malicious actors,
  leading to potential data breaches, intellectual property loss, and compromise of
  sensitive information. Restricting access to private cloud images mitigates risks
  and aligns with best practices for securing cloud environments.
description: This rule verifies that compute images within the IBM Cloud VPC are not
  publicly shared, thereby limiting exposure to only authorized users within your
  organization. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent unauthorized access
  and potential data leaks. This practice strengthens the security posture by ensuring
  that sensitive and proprietary software images are safeguarded against unauthorized
  distribution, aligning with compliance standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS. Implementing
  this control helps maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
  critical cloud resources.
