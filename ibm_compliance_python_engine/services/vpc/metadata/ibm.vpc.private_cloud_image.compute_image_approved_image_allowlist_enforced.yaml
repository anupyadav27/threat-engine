title: Enforce Allowlist for Approved Private Cloud Images in VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that only approved images are deployed within the IBM Cloud VPC
  environment is critical for maintaining a secure and compliant infrastructure. This
  rule helps prevent unauthorized or compromised images from being used, reducing
  the risk of vulnerabilities and potential data breaches. By enforcing an image allowlist,
  organizations can adhere to internal security policies and regulatory compliance
  standards, protecting sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity.
description: This rule verifies that all private cloud images utilized within the
  IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment are part of an approved image
  allowlist. The allowlist enforcement ensures that only vetted, secure images are
  deployed, minimizing the exposure to unpatched vulnerabilities and mitigating the
  risk of deploying malware-infected systems. This practice not only strengthens the
  overall security posture of the cloud environment but also aids in achieving compliance
  with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR, by controlling and auditing
  the provenance and security of deployed images.
