rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_server.compute_vm_vtpm_enabled
title: Ensure Vtpm is Enabled for Private Cloud Server VMs in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling Virtual Trusted Platform Module (Vtpm) for virtual machines (VMs)
  in IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enhances the security posture by providing hardware-based
  security features such as secure boot, integrity checks, and encryption key management.
  This is essential for protecting sensitive workloads against unauthorized access
  and data tampering, thereby maintaining business continuity and compliance with
  industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that all VMs within a private cloud server in the
  IBM VPC have Vtpm enabled, ensuring an additional layer of security through hardware-based
  cryptographic operations. By enforcing Vtpm, organizations can leverage secure boot
  processes and protect sensitive information stored in VMs, enhancing overall data
  confidentiality and integrity. This is particularly beneficial for meeting compliance
  requirements such as those stipulated by regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA.
