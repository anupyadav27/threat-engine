title: Ensuring VPC Instances Are Managed by IBM Secure Service Management (SSM)
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing that VPC instances are managed by IBM Secure Service Management
  (SSM) ensures robust oversight and control over cloud resources. This management
  framework enhances security by automating patch management, configuration compliance,
  and access control, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
  By integrating SSM, organizations can improve operational efficiency and maintain
  adherence to security policies and industry regulations.
description: This rule checks that all instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  are managed by IBM Secure Service Management (SSM). SSM is a comprehensive management
  tool that oversees critical aspects such as patch compliance, configuration management,
  and secure access controls. By ensuring VPC instances are under SSM governance,
  organizations can streamline security operations, minimize manual intervention,
  and ensure continuous monitoring and compliance with security standards. This enhances
  the overall security posture and aids in achieving compliance with industry frameworks
  and benchmarks.
