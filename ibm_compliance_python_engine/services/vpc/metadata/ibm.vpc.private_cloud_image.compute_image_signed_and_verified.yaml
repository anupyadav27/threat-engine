title: Ensure Compute Images Are Signed and Verified in IBM VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that compute images are signed and verified is critical for maintaining
  the integrity and security of virtual machines in your IBM Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC). Unsigned or unverified images can be tampered with, leading to potential
  vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. This practice safeguards your infrastructure
  by preventing unauthorized or malicious images from being deployed, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with security standards.
description: This security rule checks that all compute images used within the IBM
  VPC are cryptographically signed and verified before deployment. By enforcing image
  signing and verification, it ensures that only trusted and unaltered images are
  instantiated, thereby preventing the introduction of malicious code or unauthorized
  changes. This process helps organizations comply with security best practices and
  regulations by providing assurance that their cloud resources are secure and authentic.
  Implementing this rule enhances network security and connectivity by ensuring that
  only validated images are used, reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
