rule_id: ibm.vpc.private_cloud_subnet.network_subnet_route_table_association_present
title: Ensure Route Table Association for Private Cloud Subnets in VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Associating a route table with a private cloud subnet ensures that network
  traffic is properly directed and controlled according to organizational policies.
  This association is critical for maintaining network segmentation and security,
  preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring that data flows adhere to compliance
  requirements. Failure to implement this can lead to potentially insecure routes
  that expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized network access.
description: This rule checks that each private cloud subnet in an IBM Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) has an associated route table. The presence of a route table association
  ensures that traffic is correctly routed through secure and designated paths, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. By enforcing route table associations,
  organizations can maintain compliance with security standards and best practices,
  ensuring that network traffic adheres to predefined security configurations. This
  also aids in network visibility and control, allowing for proactive threat management
  and mitigation.
