rule_id: ibm.vpc.instance_template.launch_template_no_secrets_enabled
title: Prevent Secrets in IBM VPC Instance Launch Templates
severity: high
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that launch templates do not contain embedded secrets is crucial
  for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your cloud environment. Storing
  secrets directly in launch templates can lead to unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches, as these templates are often widely accessible to multiple users
  and systems. This practice mitigates the risk of accidental exposure and helps maintain
  compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks for the presence of secrets, such as API keys or passwords,
  embedded within IBM Cloud VPC instance launch templates. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can prevent the inadvertent exposure of sensitive information that
  could lead to unauthorized access and compromise of resources. Adhering to this
  rule not only strengthens your security posture by ensuring sensitive data is managed
  securely but also aligns with compliance frameworks that require stringent controls
  over access credentials and secrets management.
