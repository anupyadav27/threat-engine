title: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for Network Load Balancer Listeners in VPC
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that network load balancer listeners use TLS 1.2 or higher is
  crucial to protect sensitive data in transit and mitigate vulnerabilities associated
  with older TLS versions. By enforcing a minimum TLS version of 1.2, organizations
  can enhance their security posture against potential attacks like man-in-the-middle
  and downgrade attacks, thereby maintaining compliance with industry standards and
  regulations.
description: This rule checks that all network load balancer listeners in the IBM
  Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment are configured to use TLS version
  1.2 or higher. TLS 1.2 and later versions provide robust encryption and authentication
  mechanisms that are essential for secure communications over the internet. Implementing
  this rule helps organizations adhere to compliance requirements such as PCI DSS
  and HIPAA, which mandate the use of strong cryptographic protocols. Additionally,
  it reduces the risk of data breaches by preventing the use of deprecated and insecure
  TLS versions.
