rule_id: ibm.containers.worker.containers_container_instance_env_no_plaintext_secrets
title: Prevent Plaintext Secrets in Container Instance Environment Variables
severity: high
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Storing plaintext secrets within container environment variables poses
  a significant security risk, as these secrets may be inadvertently exposed through
  application logs or debugging processes. Exposure of sensitive information such
  as API keys, passwords, or tokens can lead to unauthorized access, resulting in
  potential data breaches and financial loss. Ensuring secrets are encrypted or managed
  securely mitigates the risk of exploitation and maintains the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive data.
description: This rule checks container instances within the IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  Service to ensure that environment variables do not contain plaintext secrets. By
  enforcing the use of secret management solutions or encrypted storage for sensitive
  data, this rule helps prevent unauthorized access to critical information. Implementing
  this rule enhances the overall security posture by reducing the likelihood of data
  leaks and ensures compliance with industry standards and best practices for securing
  workloads in a cloud environment.
