rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_cluster_service_kube_system_services_not_public
title: Restrict Public Access to Kubernetes System Services in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that Kubernetes system services within IBM Cloud clusters are
  not publicly accessible is crucial for protecting sensitive system components and
  configurations. Public exposure of these services can lead to unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and potential exploitation by malicious actors, posing significant
  risks to business operations and compliance adherence.
description: This rule evaluates the accessibility settings of Kubernetes system services
  in IBM Cloud clusters, ensuring they are not exposed to the public internet. By
  maintaining restricted access, the rule enhances the security posture by minimizing
  the attack surface and protecting critical system components from unauthorized access.
  Adhering to this rule supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements, ensuring that sensitive data and operations remain secure and private.
