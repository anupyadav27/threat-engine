rule_id: ibm.containers.worker.kubelet_client_ca_file_verification_enabled
title: Ensure Kubelet Client CA File Verification is Enabled on Workers
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Kubelet Client CA File verification is crucial for ensuring that
  only authorized entities can communicate with the Kubelet API on worker nodes. This
  protects against unauthorized access, reducing the risk of malicious activities
  within your Kubernetes cluster, which can lead to data breaches or service disruptions.
description: This rule checks if the Kubelet configuration on IBM Cloud worker nodes
  has the Client CA File verification enabled. By enabling this setting, the Kubelet
  verifies the client certificates against a trusted CA, ensuring that only valid
  and trusted clients can access the Kubelet API. This enhances the security posture
  by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operational interfaces within the
  Kubernetes environment. It aligns with best practices for container security and
  helps meet compliance requirements for data protection by ensuring integrity and
  authenticity in client communications.
