title: Restrict Containers from Using Host Namespace to Enhance Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting containers from using the host's namespace is crucial for maintaining
  strong isolation between the host and container environments. Allowing containers
  access to the host namespace can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, as
  it permits containers to interfere with or access sensitive host-level processes
  and resources. This rule mitigates risks of privilege escalation and unauthorized
  access, which can have serious business and security implications.
description: This rule checks if container clusters on IBM Cloud are configured to
  deny the use of the host namespace. By enforcing this policy, organizations can
  ensure that their containers operate in isolated environments, reducing the risk
  of containers affecting the host system or other containers. Implementing this rule
  strengthens the security posture by ensuring that containers cannot gain elevated
  privileges or access sensitive host data, thereby aligning with best practices for
  container security and compliance frameworks.
