title: Enforce Capabilities Restrictions for Enhanced Container Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Limiting container capabilities, specifically dropping NET_RAW and reducing
  other capabilities, is crucial for minimizing security risks associated with containerized
  applications. By constraining the permissions of containers, this rule helps prevent
  potential abuses such as unauthorized network communication and privilege escalation,
  thereby safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining system integrity.
description: This rule ensures that containerized workloads within IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  clusters are configured to drop the NET_RAW capability and have minimized capabilities
  overall. The NET_RAW capability is often unnecessary for most applications and can
  be exploited for malicious activities like packet sniffing or spoofing. By reducing
  capabilities, the attack surface is minimized, enhancing the overall security posture
  of the cluster. This approach aligns with best practices for container security
  and helps meet compliance requirements by enforcing principle of least privilege.
