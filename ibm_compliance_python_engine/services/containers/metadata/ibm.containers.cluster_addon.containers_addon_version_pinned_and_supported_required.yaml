rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster_addon.containers_addon_version_pinned_and_supported_required
title: Ensure Supported and Pinned Version for Containers Add-ons
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that container add-ons are pinned to a specific, supported version
  is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of your Kubernetes clusters.
  Unpinned or unsupported versions may lead to vulnerabilities, compatibility issues,
  and potential non-compliance with industry standards, affecting operational efficiency
  and increasing the risk of security breaches.
description: This rule checks that all container add-ons within your IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  clusters are pinned to a specific, supported version. By pinning add-ons to a specific
  version, you mitigate the risk of unintentional upgrades that might introduce compatibility
  issues or security vulnerabilities. This practice helps maintain a stable and secure
  environment, ensuring that only tested and verified updates are applied. Adhering
  to this rule also aids in compliance with security standards and best practices,
  providing a documented trail of version control for audit purposes.
