rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.apiserver_basic_auth_file_absence_enabled
title: Ensure Absence of Basic Auth File in API Server Configuration
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the absence of a Basic Auth file in the Kubernetes API server
  configuration mitigates potential unauthorized access to the cluster. Basic Authentication
  is considered insecure due to its reliance on static credentials, which can be easily
  compromised. By removing this authentication method, organizations can enhance their
  security posture and protect sensitive data and applications.
description: This rule verifies that the Kubernetes API server configuration does
  not include a Basic Auth file, which is a deprecated authentication method. The
  presence of such a file can expose the cluster to unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By ensuring its absence, clusters are aligned with security best
  practices and regulatory compliance standards, reducing the risk of credential theft
  and unauthorized access. This practice aligns with the principles of Zero Trust
  by eliminating weak authentication methods and strengthening overall access control.
