rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster_addon.containers_addon_no_privileged_permissions
title: Ensure Add-ons in IBM Cloud Clusters Run with Least Privilege
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that add-ons in IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters do not run with
  privileged permissions is crucial for maintaining a secure containerized environment.
  Privileged permissions can lead to unauthorized access and potential security breaches,
  compromising sensitive data and disrupting business operations. Adhering to the
  principle of least privilege mitigates the risk of exploitation by limiting the
  permissions granted to only what is necessary for functionality.
description: This rule checks that container add-ons within IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters
  are configured to operate without privileged permissions. By enforcing this rule,
  you ensure that add-ons do not have excessive access rights that could be exploited
  by malicious actors. This practice helps prevent privilege escalation attacks and
  supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements concerning
  data protection and access control. Implementing least privilege is a fundamental
  security principle that reduces the attack surface and enhances the overall security
  posture of your containerized workloads.
