rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kube_controller_manager_bind_address_enabled
title: Ensure Kube Controller Manager Bind Address is Configured
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring the Kube Controller Manager with a specific bind address enhances
  security by restricting access to only intended network interfaces. This minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation by malicious entities.
  Proper configuration supports compliance with security standards, reducing potential
  business impacts related to data breaches and unauthorized system access.
description: This rule checks if the Kube Controller Manager in your IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  Service cluster is configured with a specific bind address. By setting the bind
  address, you ensure that the controller manager's APIs are only accessible from
  specified network interfaces, thereby reducing the attack surface. This security
  measure is vital for maintaining a robust security posture, ensuring that only authorized
  network traffic can interact with critical cluster components. Implementing this
  configuration aligns with best practices in container and Kubernetes security, facilitating
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory frameworks.
