rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.scc_net_raw_capability_enabled
title: Ensure SCC Net Raw Capability is Disabled for Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Net Raw capability in Kubernetes clusters can expose the network
  stack to potential attacks, as it allows containers to create raw network packets.
  This capability can be exploited by attackers to perform network-based attacks,
  such as packet sniffing or man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data integrity
  and confidentiality. Disabling Net Raw ensures a more robust security posture, mitigating
  risks associated with network-level vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks whether the Security Context Constraints (SCC) in IBM
  Kubernetes clusters have the Net Raw capability enabled. By disabling this capability,
  organizations limit the potential for containers to create and manipulate raw network
  packets, thus reducing the attack surface. This practice aligns with security best
  practices and compliance requirements, ensuring that containerized applications
  operate within a secure and controlled environment. Implementing this rule helps
  in maintaining the integrity of network communications and protects sensitive data
  from unauthorized access.
