rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_cluster_service_..._approved_sources
title: Enforce Approved Sources for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Cluster Services
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that Kubernetes clusters on IBM Cloud interact only with approved
  sources is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. This
  rule mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting
  cluster communication to trusted and vetted sources, thus safeguarding sensitive
  data and maintaining the integrity of operations.
description: This rule verifies that all IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters are configured
  to communicate exclusively with approved sources. It checks the cluster's network
  policies and configurations to ensure that only predefined, trusted endpoints are
  allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. By enforcing such restrictions, the rule
  bolsters the security posture by preventing unauthorized network access and potential
  malicious activities. Additionally, adherence to this rule aligns with compliance
  frameworks and best practices for container security, reducing the risk of compliance
  violations and enhancing the overall security monitoring strategy.
