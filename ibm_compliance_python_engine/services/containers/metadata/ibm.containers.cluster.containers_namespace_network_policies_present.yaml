title: Enforce Namespace Network Policies for Secure IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing network policies in Kubernetes namespaces is crucial for securing
  containerized applications by controlling the traffic flow between pods and external
  networks. This enhances the security posture of the cluster by minimizing unauthorized
  access and reducing the attack surface. Inconsistent or absent network policies
  can lead to potential data breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations,
  impacting business continuity and reputation.
description: This rule verifies the presence of network policies within Kubernetes
  namespaces in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters. By enforcing network policies,
  organizations can define and restrict pod-to-pod and pod-to-external network traffic,
  ensuring that only permitted communications occur. This practice not only strengthens
  the security of the container environment but also aids in achieving regulatory
  compliance by adhering to best practices for network segmentation and isolation.
  The implementation of such policies is crucial for mitigating risks associated with
  lateral movement within the cluster.
