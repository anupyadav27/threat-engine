title: Enforce Task Definitions Logging Block Mode for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling the logging block mode in task definitions is crucial for maintaining
  robust security posture in containerized environments. It ensures that all activity
  within the containers is logged, providing a comprehensive audit trail that is essential
  for detecting anomalies and investigating security incidents. This practice minimizes
  the risk of data breaches and supports compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule verifies whether the logging block mode is enabled for task
  definitions in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. When activated, the logging block mode
  ensures that containers are configured to capture and store logs reliably, preventing
  any unauthorized alterations or deletions. This enhancement in logging capability
  aids in the effective monitoring and auditing of container activities, thereby reinforcing
  security controls and improving compliance with regulatory requirements like GDPR
  and HIPAA.
