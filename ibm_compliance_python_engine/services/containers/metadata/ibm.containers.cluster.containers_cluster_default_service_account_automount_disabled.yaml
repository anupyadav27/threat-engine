title: Disable Automounting for Default Service Accounts in Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Disabling the automatic mounting of service account tokens for default
  service accounts in Kubernetes clusters fortifies container security by reducing
  the risk of token misuse. This measure prevents unauthorized access to the Kubernetes
  API, ensuring that only explicitly configured workloads can interact with the cluster,
  thus minimizing attack vectors and maintaining the integrity of sensitive operations.
description: This security rule verifies that the default service accounts in Kubernetes
  clusters do not automatically mount service account tokens. By default, Kubernetes
  service accounts automatically mount tokens, which can be exploited if a malicious
  actor gains access to the container. Disabling this feature for default service
  accounts ensures that only explicitly authorized pods have access to API credentials,
  aligning with best practices for least privilege access. This enhances the security
  posture by mitigating credential exposure risks and supports compliance with security
  frameworks that mandate strict access controls.
