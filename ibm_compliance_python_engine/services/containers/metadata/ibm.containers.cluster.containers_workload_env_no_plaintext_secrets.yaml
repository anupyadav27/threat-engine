rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_workload_env_no_plaintext_secrets
title: 'Secure Environment: Avoid Plaintext Secrets in Container Workloads'
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Protecting sensitive information such as secrets in containerized applications
  is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data. Plaintext
  secrets can be easily exposed through logs, memory dumps, or unauthorized access,
  leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
  Implementing secure methods for secret management mitigates these risks and ensures
  adherence to industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule ensures that container workloads within IBM Cloud clusters
  do not utilize plaintext secrets in environment variables. It checks for the presence
  of sensitive data stored in plaintext and recommends migrating such data to secure
  storage solutions like IBM Key Protect or HashiCorp Vault. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations enhance their security posture by reducing the risk of secret exposure
  and aligning with best practices for container security and compliance. Secure secret
  management facilitates audit readiness and supports regulatory compliance frameworks,
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS.
