rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.vlan_configuration_enabled
title: Ensure VLAN Configuration is Enabled for IBM Cloud Container Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling VLAN configuration for container clusters ensures network traffic
  isolation and segmentation, enhancing security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access or lateral movement within the network. By isolating traffic, organizations
  can better control data flow, comply with regulatory requirements, and protect sensitive
  information, ultimately reducing business risk and potential financial losses from
  data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether VLAN configuration is enabled for IBM Cloud
  container clusters, which is crucial for maintaining robust network security. When
  VLANs are configured, network traffic is logically segmented, providing an additional
  security layer by isolating workloads and controlling data paths. This setup not
  only supports compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA but also
  strengthens the organization's overall security posture by reducing the attack surface
  and preventing unauthorized data access across the cluster network.
