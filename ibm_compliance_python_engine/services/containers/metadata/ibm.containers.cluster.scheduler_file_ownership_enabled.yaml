rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.scheduler_file_ownership_enabled
title: Ensure Scheduler File Ownership is Enabled for IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling scheduler file ownership is crucial for maintaining control over
  Kubernetes scheduler configurations, preventing unauthorized modifications that
  could lead to security vulnerabilities. By ensuring proper ownership, organizations
  can mitigate risks associated with accidental or malicious changes, safeguarding
  workloads and maintaining operational integrity.
description: This rule verifies that the Kubernetes scheduler component within IBM
  Cloud clusters has appropriate file ownership settings. Ensuring that only authorized
  users and processes can modify scheduler files is a fundamental security control
  that helps prevent unauthorized access and potential exploits. This practice aligns
  with compliance requirements and security best practices by enforcing the principle
  of least privilege, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of containerized
  environments.
