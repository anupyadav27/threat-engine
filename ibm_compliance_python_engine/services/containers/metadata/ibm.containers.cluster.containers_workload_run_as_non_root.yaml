rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_workload_run_as_non_root
title: Enforce Containers to Run as Non-Root in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Running containers as non-root significantly reduces the risk of privilege
  escalation attacks, where a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to the
  host system or other resources. This practice aligns with the principle of least
  privilege, enhancing overall security posture by limiting the potential impact of
  a compromised container.
description: This security rule ensures that all container workloads within an IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes cluster are configured to run as non-root users. By enforcing this
  policy, you mitigate the risks associated with running containers with elevated
  privileges, which could lead to unauthorized system access and data breaches. Implementing
  this rule not only strengthens the security of containerized environments but also
  helps in achieving compliance with industry regulations that mandate the use of
  least privilege for system processes.
