rule_id: ibm.containers.vm.feature_gate_non_root_enabled
title: Enforce Non-Root Feature Gate on IBM Cloud Container VMs
severity: critical
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that containers run with non-root privileges is a critical security
  measure that minimizes the risk of privilege escalation attacks. Running applications
  as root can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, potentially allowing attackers
  to gain control over the host system. By enforcing a non-root policy, organizations
  can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect sensitive workloads from
  unauthorized access.
description: This rule verifies that the Feature Gate Non Root is enabled on IBM Cloud
  container virtual machines. It ensures that containers are configured to run with
  non-root user privileges, thereby enhancing security by preventing potential privilege
  escalation. Enabling this feature aligns with best practices for container security
  and is crucial for compliance with industry standards such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks.
  By implementing this rule, organizations can maintain a robust security posture
  and demonstrate adherence to security compliance requirements, safeguarding their
  cloud environments against malicious activities.
