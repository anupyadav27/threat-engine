title: Enforce Admission Control in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Admission control is crucial in Kubernetes clusters as it acts as a gateway
  to manage and enforce access policies before allowing requests to interact with
  the cluster. Enabling admission control enhances security by ensuring that only
  compliant and verified resources are permitted, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized
  or malicious activities that could compromise business operations.
description: This security rule checks whether admission control is enabled for IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes clusters. Admission control intercepts requests to the cluster
  and applies predefined policies that determine whether the requests should be allowed.
  By enforcing admission control, clusters can ensure that all workloads comply with
  organizational policies, enhancing both security and operational integrity. It also
  assists in aligning with compliance frameworks by ensuring consistent application
  of security policies across all containerized environments, reducing potential vulnerabilities
  and unauthorized configurations.
