title: Ensure KMS Encryption for IBM Cloud Container Secrets is Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for container secrets
  in IBM Cloud clusters is crucial for protecting sensitive data against unauthorized
  access. Without KMS encryption, secrets stored within clusters are vulnerable to
  potential breaches, posing significant risks to data confidentiality and compliance
  with data protection regulations. Ensuring KMS encryption is enabled mitigates these
  risks, safeguarding organizational data assets and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that Key Management Service (KMS) encryption is enabled
  for secrets within IBM Cloud Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift clusters. When KMS
  encryption is activated, secrets are encrypted at rest using keys managed by IBM's
  highly secure KMS, enhancing data security by protecting sensitive information from
  unauthorized access and reducing the risk of data breaches. Implementing KMS encryption
  aligns with best practices for data protection and aids in achieving compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that the organization adheres
  to stringent data privacy and protection requirements.
