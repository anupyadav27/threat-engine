rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_workload_no_privileged_containers
title: Prevent Use of Privileged Containers in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring containers are not running with privileged status is crucial for
  maintaining a robust security posture. Privileged containers can escalate their
  permissions to the host level, potentially compromising the entire cluster and leading
  to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Limiting container privileges helps mitigate
  risks of container escape and enhances the overall security of containerized applications.
description: This rule checks for the presence of privileged containers within IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By enforcing that no containers operate with elevated
  privileges, it safeguards against potential security breaches that could arise from
  unauthorized host-level access. Implementing this rule aligns with industry best
  practices for least privilege and enhances compliance with security frameworks such
  as CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks. This practice not only fortifies the security of containerized
  workloads but also supports regulatory compliance by ensuring that container permissions
  are tightly controlled.
