rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.secrets_as_files_enabled
title: Enforce Secrets as Files in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Secrets as files in Kubernetes clusters on IBM Cloud ensures sensitive
  information such as passwords, tokens, and keys are managed securely. By using files
  to handle secrets, the risk of accidental exposure through environment variables
  is minimized, safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  which could lead to significant business and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that Kubernetes clusters on IBM Cloud are configured
  to utilize secrets as files rather than environment variables. This configuration
  enhances security by isolating sensitive data from the application runtime environment,
  reducing the risk of accidental leaks. By adhering to this best practice, organizations
  can improve their security posture and align with compliance standards that mandate
  the protection of sensitive information within containerized environments.
