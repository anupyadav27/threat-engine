rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.node_kubelet_conf_ownership_enabled
title: Ensure Node Kubelet Configuration Ownership is Enabled
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the correct ownership of the Node Kubelet configuration file is
  crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of Kubernetes clusters. Improper
  ownership could allow unauthorized users to modify or delete the configuration,
  potentially leading to cluster instability or security vulnerabilities. Ensuring
  proper ownership helps in protecting sensitive configurations from unauthorized
  access, thus maintaining operational consistency and compliance with security policies.
description: This rule verifies that the ownership of the Kubelet configuration file
  on each node within a Kubernetes cluster is set to a secure state. By ensuring that
  only authorized users have the ability to modify the Kubelet configuration, the
  rule minimizes the risk of unauthorized changes that could lead to security breaches
  or service disruptions. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to best practices
  for container security, ensuring that the Kubelet, which is responsible for managing
  container execution on Kubernetes nodes, is securely configured and maintained.
