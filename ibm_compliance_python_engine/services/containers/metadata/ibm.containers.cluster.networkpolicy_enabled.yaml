rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.networkpolicy_enabled
title: Ensure Network Policies are Enabled for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling network policies in IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters is crucial for
  segmenting and controlling inter-pod communication, thereby minimizing the risk
  of lateral movement in the event of a security breach. Implementing these policies
  helps protect sensitive data and ensures compliance with industry standards, fostering
  trust and security in business operations.
description: This rule verifies that network policies are enabled on IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  clusters, which are essential for defining rules that control the flow of traffic
  to and from pods. By implementing network policies, organizations can restrict traffic
  based on policies, thus enhancing the security posture by preventing unauthorized
  access and communication. Enabling network policies aligns with security best practices
  and compliance requirements, as it provides an additional layer of security by isolating
  workloads and preventing potential threats from propagating within the cluster.
