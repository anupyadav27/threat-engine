rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_conf_permissions_enabled
title: Ensure Secure Permissions for Kubelet Configuration Files
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring secure permissions for Kubelet configuration files is critical
  to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the Kubernetes cluster's operational
  parameters. Improper permissions could allow unauthorized users to read or modify
  these files, leading to potential security breaches or unintentional cluster misconfigurations
  that could disrupt business operations.
description: This rule checks that the permissions on Kubelet configuration files
  are set to restrict access only to authorized users. By enforcing stringent file
  permissions, Kubernetes administrators can prevent unauthorized access and mitigate
  risks associated with potential data leakage or malicious modifications. Implementing
  secure permissions aligns with best practices for Kubernetes security and helps
  organizations comply with industry standards and regulatory requirements, enhancing
  overall security posture.
