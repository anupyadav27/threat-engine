rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.file_ownership_enabled
title: Enforce File Ownership on IBM Cloud Container Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that file ownership is correctly configured on container clusters
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized access. Misconfigured
  file ownership can lead to privilege escalation, where unauthorized users gain access
  to sensitive data or critical system functions. By enforcing proper file ownership,
  organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches and ensure compliance with
  security standards.
description: This rule evaluates whether file ownership is enabled and correctly configured
  on IBM Cloud container clusters. It checks for appropriate user and group ownership
  settings on critical files and directories within the cluster environment. Ensuring
  proper file ownership enhances security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data compromise. Moreover, it supports compliance with industry standards
  and best practices, such as CIS Benchmarks, which advocate for strict access controls
  and data protection measures.
