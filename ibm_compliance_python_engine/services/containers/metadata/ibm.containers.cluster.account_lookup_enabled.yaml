rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.account_lookup_enabled
title: Ensure Account Lookup is Enabled for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling account lookup for IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters enhances security
  by verifying user identities and permissions before granting access. This prevents
  unauthorized access, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches or malicious activity.
  Maintaining this control is vital for protecting sensitive workloads and aligning
  with compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks if the account lookup feature is enabled for IBM Cloud
  Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that identity verification and access management are
  robustly enforced. By enabling account lookup, clusters can authenticate user requests
  against defined access policies, thereby preventing unauthorized access and potential
  security threats. This practice supports compliance with security standards and
  improves overall security posture by ensuring that only authorized users can interact
  with cluster resources.
