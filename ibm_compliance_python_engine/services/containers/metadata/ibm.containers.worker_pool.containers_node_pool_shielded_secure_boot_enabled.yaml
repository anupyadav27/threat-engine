rule_id: ibm.containers.worker_pool.containers_node_pool_shielded_secure_boot_enabled
title: Ensure Shielded Secure Boot is Enabled for Container Node Pools
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Shielded Secure Boot for container node pools helps prevent unauthorized
  or malicious code from running during the boot process, thereby maintaining the
  integrity and security of the nodes. This measure is crucial for protecting sensitive
  workloads and ensuring compliance with security standards, thereby minimizing potential
  business disruptions and data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Shielded Secure Boot is enabled for all container
  node pools within IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Shielded Secure Boot provides a
  hardware-based root of trust, ensuring that only verified and signed operating systems
  are loaded. By enabling this feature, organizations can enhance the security posture
  of their container environments, align with best practices for cloud security, and
  meet compliance requirements such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and others that mandate strict
  control over system integrity and authentication.
