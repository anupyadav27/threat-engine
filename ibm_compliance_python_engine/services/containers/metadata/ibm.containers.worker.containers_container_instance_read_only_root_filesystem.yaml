title: Enforce Read-Only Root Filesystem for Container Instances
severity: critical
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Ensuring container instances have a read-only root filesystem significantly
  reduces the risk of unauthorized modifications, protecting against potential attacks
  that exploit writable filesystems to inject malicious code. This security measure
  is critical for maintaining the integrity and stability of applications running
  in containerized environments, which directly impacts business continuity and trust.
description: This rule checks that the root filesystem of container instances is set
  to read-only, preventing any unauthorized write actions. By enforcing a read-only
  policy, it helps mitigate risks associated with malicious activities such as filesystem
  tampering, data exfiltration, and privilege escalation. Implementing this configuration
  enhances compliance with security standards and best practices, ensuring robust
  protection of workloads in IBM Cloud environments.
