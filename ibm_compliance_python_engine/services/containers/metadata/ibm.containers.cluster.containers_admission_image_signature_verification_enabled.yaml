rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_admission_image_signature_verification_enabled
title: Ensure Image Signature Verification is Enabled in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling image signature verification is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and authenticity of container images deployed within IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters.
  By ensuring that only trusted, signed images are admitted, organizations can mitigate
  the risk of running compromised or tampered images, thereby protecting applications
  from potential security threats and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether image signature verification is enabled for
  container admissions in an IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. By enabling this feature,
  the cluster enforces that only images signed with trusted keys can be deployed,
  which helps prevent unauthorized or malicious images from being executed. This enhances
  the overall security posture by ensuring that all container images are validated
  against known and trusted sources, reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable or
  malicious code. Additionally, it supports compliance with security policies and
  regulatory requirements by providing a mechanism to verify the provenance and integrity
  of deployed images.
