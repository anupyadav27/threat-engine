title: Enforce API Priority and Fairness in Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling API Priority and Fairness in Kubernetes clusters ensures that
  critical workloads receive appropriate resources and service levels, preventing
  service disruptions due to resource contention. This mechanism is vital in multi-tenant
  environments where different teams or applications may have competing demands, helping
  maintain operational stability and efficiency.
description: This rule verifies whether the API Priority and Fairness feature is enabled
  in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters. This feature allows fine-grained control
  over API requests, ensuring that higher-priority requests are processed preferentially,
  which prevents lower-priority requests from monopolizing resources. Enabling this
  feature enhances security by protecting against denial-of-service scenarios and
  supports compliance by providing a more predictable and fair resource allocation
  model, aligning with best practices in resource management and operational governance.
