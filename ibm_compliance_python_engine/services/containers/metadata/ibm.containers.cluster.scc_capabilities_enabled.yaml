rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.scc_capabilities_enabled
title: Ensure Secure Capability Settings in Kubernetes Service Accounts
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Secure Capability Controls (SCC) in Kubernetes clusters is crucial
  for minimizing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to resources.
  By restricting the capabilities that a container can inherit, organizations can
  enforce the principle of least privilege, thereby reducing the potential attack
  surface and ensuring compliance with security policies.
description: This rule checks for the appropriate configuration of Security Context
  Constraints (SCC) in IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters, specifically focusing on the
  capabilities that are enabled. Enforcing strict SCC configurations ensures that
  containers do not run with elevated privileges, which is a common vector for attacks.
  Implementing this rule helps protect against unauthorized privilege escalation and
  aligns with industry best practices for container security, enhancing the overall
  security posture and compliance with regulatory standards.
