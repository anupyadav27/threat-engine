title: Ensure Container Image Provenance from Trusted Registry Sources
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring image provenance registry sources is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and security of containerized applications. By specifying trusted
  registry sources, organizations can prevent the deployment of potentially harmful
  or unverified images, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities and malicious
  code into their environments. This practice not only protects the business from
  potential security breaches but also ensures compliance with industry standards
  and regulations.
description: This rule checks that all container clusters within IBM Cloud are configured
  to use specified and trusted image registry sources for pulling container images.
  By enforcing this configuration, organizations can ensure that only vetted and secure
  images are used in their production environments. This enhances the overall security
  posture by minimizing the risk of deploying vulnerable or compromised images. Additionally,
  aligning image provenance with trusted registries supports compliance with security
  frameworks and industry best practices, such as CIS Benchmarks and NIST guidelines,
  which advocate for controlled and verified image sources.
