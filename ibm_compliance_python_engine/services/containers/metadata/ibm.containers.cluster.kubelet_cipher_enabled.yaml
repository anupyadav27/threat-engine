title: Enforce Kubelet Cipher Suites for Enhanced Cluster Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Kubelet cipher suites is critical for securing communication between
  the Kubelet and other components within a Kubernetes cluster. This ensures data
  confidentiality and integrity, protecting sensitive information from being intercepted
  by malicious actors. By implementing this rule, organizations can mitigate the risk
  of data breaches and maintain compliance with industry security standards.
description: This security rule checks if the Kubelet in a Kubernetes cluster is configured
  to use approved cipher suites for secure communication. By enforcing robust cipher
  suites, the rule ensures that the data exchanged between the Kubelet and Kubernetes
  API server is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. This not only enhances the
  security posture of the cluster but also aligns with compliance best practices,
  such as those outlined by NIST and other regulatory bodies. Implementing recommended
  ciphers helps in maintaining a secure environment and reduces the attack surface
  of the cluster.
