rule_id: ibm.containers.resource.task_definitions_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Container Task Definitions
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for container task definitions is crucial for monitoring
  and troubleshooting within the IBM Cloud environment. Without proper logging, identifying
  security incidents, system faults, or suspicious activities becomes challenging,
  potentially leading to unaddressed vulnerabilities and compliance breaches. Comprehensive
  logging supports operational integrity and aids in meeting regulatory requirements,
  thereby minimizing the risk of data exposure and financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for container task definitions
  within the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. By ensuring logging is active, organizations
  can capture detailed operational data, including API calls, system diagnostics,
  and error reports. This data is foundational for auditing activities, detecting
  anomalies, and ensuring that container workloads are operating securely. Compliance
  with this rule enhances visibility into the container environment, facilitates incident
  response, and supports adherence to industry standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR.
