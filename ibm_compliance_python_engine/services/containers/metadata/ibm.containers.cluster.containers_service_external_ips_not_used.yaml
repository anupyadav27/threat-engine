rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_service_external_ips_not_used
title: Restrict Usage of External IPs in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Limiting the use of external IPs in Kubernetes clusters is crucial for
  reducing the attack surface exposed to potential external threats. By restricting
  external IP usage, organizations can enhance the security of their microservices
  and applications, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This approach not only protects sensitive data but also ensures a more controlled
  and secure network environment within the IBM Cloud infrastructure.
description: This rule checks for the presence of external IPs in IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  clusters and flags any instances where they are being used. By ensuring that external
  IPs are not utilized within the cluster, the potential for unauthorized access is
  significantly reduced, thereby safeguarding the cluster's resources from external
  threats. Adhering to this practice aligns with security best practices and compliance
  standards by maintaining a secure cluster environment, enhancing overall network
  security posture, and reducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
