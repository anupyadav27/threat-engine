rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.worker_nodes_latest_patch_enabled
title: Ensure IBM Cloud Worker Nodes Are Patched with Latest Security Updates
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Keeping worker nodes updated with the latest patches is crucial for safeguarding
  against security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Unpatched
  nodes can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions, which
  can severely impact business operations and compromise sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that all worker nodes in your IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  clusters are running the latest security patches. By ensuring that nodes are consistently
  updated, organizations can mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.
  Regular patch management not only enhances the security posture but also aligns
  with compliance standards and best practices, reducing the threat landscape and
  fortifying the cloud environment against potential attacks.
