rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.pod_seccomp_profile_enabled
title: Ensure Pod Seccomp Profile is Enabled for IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Seccomp profiles for pods is crucial for enhancing the security
  posture of containerized applications within IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Seccomp
  acts as a security mechanism to restrict the system calls that applications can
  make, thereby reducing the attack surface and mitigating potential exploits. This
  practice safeguards business-critical applications from unauthorized access and
  reduces the risk of security breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Seccomp profiles are enabled for all pods in
  an IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. A Seccomp profile specifies a set of allowed system
  calls, preventing the execution of potentially harmful operations. By enforcing
  this security measure, organizations can better protect their containerized applications
  from vulnerabilities and attacks that exploit system-level access. Compliance with
  this rule not only fortifies security but also aligns with best practices and regulatory
  requirements for container security management.
