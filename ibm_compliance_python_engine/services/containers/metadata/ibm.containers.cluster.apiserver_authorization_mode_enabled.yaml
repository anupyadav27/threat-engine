title: Enforce Apiserver Authorization Modes for Secure Cluster Operations
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling authorization modes on the Kubernetes API server is crucial for
  controlling access to resources within an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster.
  This rule ensures that only authenticated and authorized requests can interact with
  the cluster, thereby preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
  Implementing this security measure helps maintain the integrity and availability
  of containerized applications, which is vital for business continuity and compliance
  with security standards.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubernetes API server on an IBM Cloud cluster
  has one or more authorization modes enabled, such as Node, RBAC (Role-Based Access
  Control), or Webhook. By enabling these authorization modes, you can enforce fine-grained
  access controls, ensuring that users and service accounts have the necessary permissions
  to perform specific actions. This not only enhances the security of the cluster
  by mitigating the risk of unauthorized access but also supports compliance with
  industry standards and best practices for cloud security and container management.
