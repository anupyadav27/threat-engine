rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.unsupported_config_overrides_compliance_enabled
title: Ensure Compliance with Unsupported Config Overrides in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling compliance with unsupported configuration overrides in IBM Cloud
  clusters is crucial for maintaining a secure and stable Kubernetes environment.
  This rule ensures that any deviations from supported configurations are monitored
  and flagged, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities or operational issues
  that could lead to data breaches or system failures.
description: This rule checks whether compliance with unsupported configuration overrides
  is enabled for IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By monitoring these configurations,
  organizations can detect and address deviations from standard security practices,
  ensuring that any customizations do not compromise the cluster's security posture.
  Enforcing compliance with supported configurations helps maintain operational integrity,
  align with industry best practices, and meet regulatory requirements, thereby reducing
  the risk of security incidents and ensuring business continuity.
