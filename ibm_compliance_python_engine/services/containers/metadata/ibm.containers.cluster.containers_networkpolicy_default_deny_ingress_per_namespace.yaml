title: Enforce Default Deny Ingress Policies in Kubernetes Namespaces
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing a default deny ingress network policy per namespace is crucial
  for minimizing unauthorized access to containerized applications. This rule mitigates
  the risk of unintended exposure of services to the internet, thereby reducing the
  attack surface and potential security vulnerabilities. Ensuring that only approved
  ingress traffic is allowed enhances the overall security posture and compliance
  with industry standards.
description: This security rule checks that each Kubernetes namespace within an IBM
  Cloud cluster has a default deny ingress network policy. By enforcing such a policy,
  all incoming traffic is blocked by default, and only explicitly allowed traffic
  is permitted, thereby preventing unauthorized access. This approach strengthens
  application security by ensuring that ingress traffic is carefully controlled and
  monitored. Moreover, it aligns with best practices for regulatory compliance, such
  as those outlined in standards like PCI DSS and ISO 27001, which require strict
  access control measures.
