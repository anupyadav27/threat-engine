rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_config_file_ownership_enabled
title: Ensure Kubelet Config File Ownership is Properly Configured
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring the correct ownership of the Kubelet configuration file is crucial
  for maintaining the integrity and security of your Kubernetes environment. Improper
  file ownership can lead to unauthorized modifications, potentially compromising
  cluster operations and data confidentiality. From a business perspective, maintaining
  control over configuration management mitigates risks of service disruptions and
  aligns with compliance requirements.
description: This rule verifies that the ownership of the Kubelet configuration file
  is set to the appropriate user and group, typically 'root', on each node within
  an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster. By enforcing strict file ownership, this
  rule helps prevent unauthorized access and modifications to critical configuration
  settings. Adhering to this practice enhances the security posture by ensuring that
  only authorized personnel can alter node configurations, thereby supporting compliance
  with industry standards and regulatory frameworks.
