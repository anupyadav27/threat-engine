rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.pki_keyfile_permissions_enabled
title: Enforce Secure PKI Keyfile Permissions in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that PKI keyfiles have appropriate permissions is crucial for
  maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your container cluster's communication
  channels. Unauthorized access to these keyfiles can lead to data breaches and unauthorized
  cluster access, potentially resulting in severe business disruptions and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule verifies that PKI keyfiles within an IBM Cloud container cluster
  have secure permissions set, restricting access to only authorized users and processes.
  By enforcing strict keyfile permissions, organizations can prevent unauthorized
  access and potential exploitation of sensitive cryptographic material. This practice
  is essential for adhering to security best practices and industry compliance standards,
  thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the container environment.
