title: Ensure Fargate Profiles Utilize Private Subnets for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Utilizing private subnets for Fargate profiles significantly reduces the
  attack surface by limiting external exposure. This configuration ensures that containers
  are shielded from unauthorized access, thereby maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity. Businesses benefit from reduced risk of data breaches and compliance
  violations, which can lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all Fargate profiles within IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  Service clusters are configured to use private subnets exclusively. By enforcing
  this setup, network traffic is restricted to internal channels, preventing direct
  internet access to containers. This enhances the overall security posture by ensuring
  that sensitive workloads are isolated from public networks. Implementing private
  subnet configurations aligns with best practices for network security, helping organizations
  meet regulatory requirements and industry standards for data protection.
