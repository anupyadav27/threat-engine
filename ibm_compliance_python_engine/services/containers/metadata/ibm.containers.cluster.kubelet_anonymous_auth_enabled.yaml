rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_anonymous_auth_enabled
title: Ensure Kubelet Anonymous Authentication is Disabled in IBM Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling anonymous authentication in Kubernetes clusters can lead to unauthorized
  access, posing a potential risk to sensitive workloads and data. Disabling anonymous
  authentication ensures that all interactions with the Kubelet API are authenticated,
  mitigating the risk of unauthorized actions and enhancing the overall security posture
  of the cluster.
description: This rule checks whether anonymous authentication is disabled on the
  Kubelet, the primary "node agent" that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster.
  By disabling anonymous authentication, you enforce that all requests to the Kubelet
  must be made by authenticated users, preventing unauthorized access. This practice
  not only strengthens the security of the cluster by ensuring that only validated
  users can interact with the Kubelet API but also aligns with compliance standards
  that require strict access controls for system components within a cloud environment.
