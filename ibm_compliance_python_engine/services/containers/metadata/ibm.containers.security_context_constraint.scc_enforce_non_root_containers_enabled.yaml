title: Enforce Non-Root Containers for Enhanced Kubernetes Security
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing non-root containers is crucial in preventing privilege escalation
  attacks within Kubernetes environments. Running containers with root privileges
  exposes systems to higher security risks, as malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities
  to gain unauthorized access. By mandating non-root execution, organizations reduce
  the attack surface, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust with
  stakeholders.
description: This rule ensures that the Security Context Constraints (SCC) are configured
  to enforce non-root containers in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. It checks that containers
  do not run with root privileges, aligning with security best practices that minimize
  the risk of privilege escalation. Implementing this rule enhances the overall security
  posture by ensuring adherence to least privilege principles. Additionally, it supports
  compliance with industry standards such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks, helping organizations
  meet regulatory requirements and avoid potential penalties.
