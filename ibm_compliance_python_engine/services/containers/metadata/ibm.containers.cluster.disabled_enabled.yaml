rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.disabled_enabled
title: Ensure Kubernetes Cluster Security Features Are Enabled
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling security features in Kubernetes clusters is crucial for protecting
  containerized applications from unauthorized access and potential breaches. These
  security measures help maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data within
  the cluster, ensuring compliance with industry standards and safeguarding business
  operations from security threats.
description: This rule checks whether essential security features are enabled on IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes clusters, such as network policies, pod security policies, and
  logging mechanisms. By ensuring these features are activated, organizations enhance
  their overall security posture, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and facilitating
  compliance with security frameworks. Enabling these features helps in monitoring
  cluster activities, controlling traffic flow, and enforcing security policies, which
  are critical for maintaining a secure and compliant environment.
