title: Enable Namespace Lifecycle Admission Control in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Namespace Lifecycle Admission Control is critical for maintaining
  a secure and organized cluster environment. This control prevents unauthorized or
  accidental deletion of namespaces, which could lead to significant disruptions or
  data loss. By ensuring namespaces are managed systematically, businesses can enhance
  operational stability and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the Namespace Lifecycle Admission Control feature
  is enabled within IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. This control ensures that namespace
  operations, such as creation, modification, and deletion, are subject to strict
  governance policies, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes. Enforcing namespace
  lifecycle management enhances security by preventing accidental or malicious namespace
  deletions, which could compromise workloads and violate compliance requirements.
  By implementing this control, organizations can maintain a robust security posture
  and align with best practices in container and Kubernetes security.
