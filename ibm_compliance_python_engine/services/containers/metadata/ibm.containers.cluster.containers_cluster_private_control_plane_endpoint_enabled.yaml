title: Enforce Private Endpoint for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Control Plane
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling a private control plane endpoint for IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters
  ensures that communication between the Kubernetes API server and cluster nodes occurs
  over a private network. This minimizes the exposure of sensitive control plane operations
  to the public internet, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential attacks. Implementing private endpoints enhances the overall security
  posture of the cluster by providing a more controlled and secure environment for
  managing containerized applications.
description: This security rule verifies that the private control plane endpoint is
  enabled for IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. When enabled, this configuration ensures
  that all Kubernetes API traffic is restricted to a private network, enhancing the
  cluster's security by preventing unauthorized external access. By adopting this
  practice, organizations can achieve compliance with network security and access
  control standards, thereby aligning with best practices for securing cloud-native
  applications. This setup helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality while
  supporting an organization's regulatory compliance requirements.
