rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_fargate_profile_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Fargate Profile Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Fargate Profile logging is essential for maintaining visibility
  into the operational aspects of containerized applications. It allows security teams
  to track access patterns, detect anomalies, and respond to incidents more effectively.
  Without logging, businesses may face challenges in auditing actions within their
  clusters, potentially leading to compliance violations and increased security risks.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Fargate Profiles within
  IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters. By ensuring that logs are captured and stored,
  organizations can enhance their ability to monitor and audit container activities,
  helping to identify unauthorized access and potential security incidents. Logging
  also supports compliance with industry regulations by providing evidence of security
  controls and access patterns, thus safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust
  with stakeholders.
