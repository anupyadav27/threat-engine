rule_id: ibm.containers.vm.shareable_disks
title: Ensure VM Disks Are Not Shareable in IBM Cloud Container Services
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Shareable disks in virtual machine environments can pose a security risk
  by potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. By ensuring that
  VM disks are not shareable, organizations can reduce the attack surface and prevent
  data leakage, thereby maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of critical
  business information.
description: This rule checks whether virtual machine disks within IBM Cloud Container
  Services are configured to be non-shareable. By enforcing non-shareable disk configurations,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized data access and ensure
  compliance with security and data protection standards. Implementing this rule enhances
  the overall security posture by safeguarding against vulnerabilities that arise
  from shared storage environments, ensuring that sensitive data remains accessible
  only to authorized workloads and users.
