rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_workload_host_network_pid_ipc_disabled
title: Disable Host Network, PID, and IPC in Container Workloads
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Disabling host network, PID, and IPC for container workloads is crucial
  for minimizing the attack surface and preventing potential unauthorized access to
  sensitive host resources. This isolation ensures that workloads operate within their
  designated boundaries, reducing the risk of privilege escalation and data breaches,
  which can have significant financial and reputational impacts on an organization.
description: This security rule checks if container workloads running in IBM Cloud
  clusters are configured to disable host network, PID, and IPC sharing. Enforcing
  this isolation prevents containers from leveraging host-level resources, which could
  lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access and lateral movement
  within the cluster. By adhering to this rule, organizations enhance their security
  posture, align with industry best practices, and meet compliance requirements such
  as those outlined in CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes.
