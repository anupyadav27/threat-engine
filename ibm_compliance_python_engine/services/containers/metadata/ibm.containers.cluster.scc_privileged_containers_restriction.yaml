title: Restrict Privileged Container Access in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting privileged containers is crucial to maintaining robust security
  in Kubernetes environments. Privileged containers have extensive access to the host's
  resources, posing a high risk of exploitation if compromised. By enforcing restrictions,
  businesses can significantly reduce the attack surface, helping to protect sensitive
  data and maintain compliance with security standards.
description: This rule ensures that Kubernetes clusters on IBM Cloud do not run containers
  with elevated privileges by utilizing Security Context Constraints (SCC). The rule
  checks cluster configurations to prevent the deployment of privileged pods, which
  could otherwise access host system resources beyond the intended scope. Implementing
  this restriction helps enforce the principle of least privilege, minimizing potential
  vulnerabilities and supporting compliance with industry security protocols and regulations.
