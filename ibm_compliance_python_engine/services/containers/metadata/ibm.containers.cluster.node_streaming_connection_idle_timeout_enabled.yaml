title: Enforce Node Streaming Connection Idle Timeout in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling idle timeout for node streaming connections in IBM Cloud clusters
  is crucial to mitigate the risk of enduring unauthorized access and potential exploitation
  of open connections. This security measure helps to ensure that inactive connections
  are terminated, thereby reducing the attack surface and enhancing the overall security
  posture of containerized environments.
description: This rule verifies that the idle timeout setting for streaming connections
  on nodes within IBM Cloud clusters is enabled. By enforcing an idle timeout, connections
  that remain inactive for a specified period are automatically closed, preventing
  prolonged exposure to security threats. This enhances the security of container
  workloads by minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit open
  connections. Implementing this rule aligns with best practices in container and
  Kubernetes security, contributing to compliance with industry standards such as
  CIS Kubernetes benchmarks.
