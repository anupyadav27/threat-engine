rule_id: ibm.containers.worker_pool.containers_node_pool_nodes_no_public_ip
title: Ensure Nodes in Containers Worker Pools Lack Public IP Addresses
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Public IP addresses on container node pool nodes can expose your cloud
  resources to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and potential attacks. By ensuring nodes do not have public IPs, you enhance the
  security posture of your cloud environment and safeguard business-critical applications
  and data against external threats.
description: This rule checks that nodes within IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service worker
  pools do not possess public IP addresses. By enforcing this security measure, organizations
  reduce the attack surface and limit exposure to external threats. Nodes without
  public IPs can still communicate securely within the private network, leveraging
  IBM Cloud's private endpoints and networks. This approach aligns with best practices
  for identity and access management, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards
  by keeping sensitive resources isolated from public access.
