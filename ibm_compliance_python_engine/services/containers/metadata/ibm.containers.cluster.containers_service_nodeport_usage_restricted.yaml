rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_service_nodeport_usage_restricted
title: Restrict NodePort Usage in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting NodePort usage in container services minimizes the attack surface
  by limiting external access to services that do not require it, thereby reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This is crucial for
  maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of applications running in a Kubernetes
  cluster, especially in environments that demand high security standards.
description: This rule checks for the configuration of NodePort services in IBM Cloud
  Kubernetes clusters. NodePort services can expose applications to the internet,
  potentially leading to unintended access if not properly restricted. By ensuring
  NodePort usage is restricted, you enhance the security posture of your environment
  by preventing unnecessary exposure of services. This aligns with best practices
  in container security, ensuring adherence to compliance standards such as CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmarks, thus offering a robust security framework for your cloud infrastructure.
