rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.controller_manager_bind_address_enabled
title: Ensure Controller Manager Bind Address is Enabled on IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Controller Manager Bind Address is crucial for maintaining
  secure communication pathways within your Kubernetes cluster. This configuration
  minimizes exposure to unauthorized access by binding services to specific network
  interfaces, thereby reducing the attack surface. Ensuring this setting is enabled
  helps protect sensitive data and maintains compliance with security best practices.
description: This security rule checks if the Controller Manager Bind Address is enabled
  on your IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. The Controller Manager is a critical component
  responsible for maintaining cluster operations, and enabling bind address ensures
  that it listens only on specific network interfaces. This configuration reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation by limiting the network
  interfaces exposed to external traffic. Compliance with this rule aligns with industry
  standards for secure Kubernetes deployments, enhancing the overall security posture
  of the cloud environment.
