title: Ensure Hyperconverged KSM Configuration is Enabled in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Hyperconverged Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM) in IBM Cloud clusters
  optimizes memory usage by merging identical memory pages. This configuration is
  pivotal in enhancing resource efficiency and reducing memory overhead, thereby bolstering
  the performance and scalability of containerized applications. From a security standpoint,
  it ensures that the system's resources are managed effectively, minimizing the risk
  of performance degradation and potential vulnerabilities due to resource exhaustion.
description: This rule verifies that Hyperconverged KSM is enabled within IBM Cloud
  Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters. KSM is a memory-sharing technology that consolidates
  identical memory pages, allowing more efficient memory utilization. By enabling
  KSM, organizations can achieve better resource allocation, which is crucial for
  maintaining optimal application performance and reducing costs. Additionally, this
  configuration aids in aligning with best practices for resource management and operational
  efficiency, contributing to a secure and compliant cloud environment.
