rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.etcd_permissions_enabled
title: Enable Etcd Permissions for Secure Kubernetes Management
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that Etcd permissions are properly configured is critical for
  maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of Kubernetes cluster data. Etcd serves
  as the primary datastore for Kubernetes, and improper access controls could lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential service disruptions. By enabling
  strict permissions, organizations can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized
  data manipulation, thereby protecting business operations and maintaining compliance
  with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that Etcd permissions are enabled and properly configured
  within IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. Etcd, as the backend datastore for Kubernetes,
  requires robust access controls to prevent unauthorized interactions. By enabling
  Etcd permissions, the rule ensures that only authenticated and authorized users
  can access sensitive cluster data, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
  This not only protects against data breaches but also aligns with compliance mandates
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data access policies.
