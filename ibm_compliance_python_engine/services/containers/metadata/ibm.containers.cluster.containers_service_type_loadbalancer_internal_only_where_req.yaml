title: Enforce Internal-Only LoadBalancers for Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that Kubernetes LoadBalancers are configured for internal use
  only where necessary minimizes exposure to external threats. This practice reduces
  the attack surface by restricting access to internal services, thus safeguarding
  sensitive data and applications from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
description: This rule checks the configuration of Kubernetes clusters to ensure that
  LoadBalancers are set to internal-only mode when required. By implementing internal-only
  LoadBalancers, the rule enhances the security of containerized services by limiting
  external network access. This configuration supports compliance with security policies
  and industry standards that mandate strict access controls and network segmentation,
  contributing to a robust security posture for cloud-native applications.
