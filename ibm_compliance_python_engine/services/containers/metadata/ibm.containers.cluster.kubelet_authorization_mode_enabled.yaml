rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_authorization_mode_enabled
title: Ensure Kubelet Authorization Mode is Enabled on IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Kubelet Authorization Mode is crucial for securing Kubernetes
  clusters as it restricts access to the kubelet API, which controls the node and
  its pods. Without this, unauthorized users could potentially execute commands on
  the node, leading to data breaches or service disruptions. Proper authorization
  enhances security posture by ensuring that only legitimate requests are processed,
  thus protecting sensitive workloads and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule checks if the Kubelet Authorization Mode is enabled on IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By enforcing authorization, the system ensures that all
  requests to the kubelet API are validated against predefined policies, preventing
  unauthorized access. This configuration not only bolsters security by reducing the
  risk of malicious actions but also aligns with industry compliance standards such
  as CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes. Implementing this setting aids in maintaining
  a secure and compliant environment, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
