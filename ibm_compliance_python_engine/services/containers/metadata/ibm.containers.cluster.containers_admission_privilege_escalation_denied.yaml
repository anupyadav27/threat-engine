rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_admission_privilege_escalation_denied
title: Prevent Privilege Escalation in Kubernetes with Admission Controls
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Preventing privilege escalation in containerized environments is critical
  to maintaining a secure and compliant infrastructure. By denying privilege escalation
  at the container admission stage, organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive resources and potential exploitation of elevated permissions,
  thereby protecting their assets and maintaining operational integrity.
description: This rule ensures that Kubernetes clusters on IBM Cloud are configured
  to deny privilege escalation during container admission. It checks the container
  specifications in the cluster to ensure that the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` setting
  is explicitly set to `false`. By enforcing this configuration, organizations can
  enhance their security posture by adhering to the principle of least privilege,
  reducing the attack surface, and ensuring compliance with industry best practices
  and regulatory standards. Implementing such controls aids in safeguarding against
  potential attacks that exploit elevated permissions to compromise container and
  cluster security.
