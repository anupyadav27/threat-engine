title: Ensure Admission SecurityContextConstraint is Enabled for IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Admission SecurityContextConstraint in IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters
  is crucial for maintaining robust security controls over containerized workloads.
  It helps prevent the deployment of containers with potentially dangerous configurations
  that could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Ensuring this setting
  is enabled protects sensitive data and aligns with best practices for compliance
  and risk management.
description: This rule verifies that the Admission SecurityContextConstraint is enabled
  on IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By enforcing security context constraints, the
  cluster administrator can set restrictions on pods, ensuring that only containers
  with secure and compliant configurations are allowed to run. This includes limiting
  privilege escalation, enforcing read-only root file systems, and ensuring non-root
  user execution, all of which improve the cluster's security posture. Enabling this
  feature also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards by ensuring consistent
  security policies are applied across all workloads.
