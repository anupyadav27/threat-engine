rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_make_iptables_util_chains_enabled
title: Ensure Kubelet Make Iptables Util Chains is Enabled for Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Kubelet Make Iptables Util Chains feature ensures that the
  Kubernetes kubelet can create and manage iptables rules effectively. This is crucial
  for maintaining network policies and traffic flow control, which are vital in protecting
  containerized applications from unauthorized access and potential network-based
  attacks. By ensuring this setting is enabled, organizations can better safeguard
  their Kubernetes environments, minimizing downtime and potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubelet Make Iptables Util Chains setting
  is enabled on Kubernetes clusters managed by the IBM Cloud. When enabled, this feature
  allows the kubelet to automatically create iptables chains needed for Kubernetes
  network policies, thereby enhancing the security posture of the cluster. By ensuring
  that iptables chains are properly managed, organizations can achieve greater control
  over network traffic, ensuring compliance with internal security policies and external
  regulatory requirements. This contributes to a more robust security monitoring framework
  within the container and Kubernetes security domain.
