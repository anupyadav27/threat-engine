rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_namespace_pod_security_level_restricted
title: Enforce Pod Security to Restricted Level in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing a restricted pod security level is crucial for minimizing
  vulnerabilities within Kubernetes clusters. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can prevent applications from acquiring excessive permissions, thereby reducing
  the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access. This safeguard not only
  protects sensitive data but also ensures compliance with industry standards and
  security best practices.
description: This rule verifies that namespaces within IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters
  adhere to a restricted pod security level. By enforcing this restriction, the rule
  ensures that pods are limited in their allowed capabilities, such as prohibiting
  the use of privileged containers and restricting access to the host network. This
  practice enhances the security posture by reducing the attack surface and ensuring
  that only necessary permissions are granted to applications. Adhering to this level
  of security helps organizations maintain compliance with regulatory requirements
  and industry standards, thereby enhancing overall governance and risk management.
