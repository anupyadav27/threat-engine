title: Ensure Default Deny Egress Network Policies Per Namespace in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing a default deny egress policy for each namespace is crucial
  for minimizing the risk of data exfiltration and unauthorized data transfers from
  containerized applications. By restricting outbound traffic, organizations can better
  control data flows and prevent potential breaches, thereby protecting sensitive
  information and maintaining trust with customers and stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that each namespace within an IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  cluster has a default deny egress policy established. The policy ensures that no
  outbound network traffic is allowed unless explicitly permitted, thereby reducing
  the attack surface and preventing unauthorized data flow. Implementing this control
  contributes to enhanced security posture and aligns with compliance mandates that
  require strict control over data leaving the organizational boundaries, such as
  GDPR and PCI DSS.
