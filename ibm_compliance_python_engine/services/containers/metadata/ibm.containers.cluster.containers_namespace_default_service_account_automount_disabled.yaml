title: Enforce Disabling Automount for Default Service Account in Kubernetes
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Disabling the automount of service account tokens for the default service
  account in Kubernetes namespaces is crucial to minimize the attack surface and prevent
  unauthorized access. By ensuring that these tokens are not automatically mounted,
  you reduce the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to the Kubernetes
  API, which is vital for maintaining the security and integrity of your containerized
  applications.
description: This rule checks whether the automount of service account tokens for
  the default service account within a Kubernetes namespace is disabled. By default,
  Kubernetes mounts service account tokens into pods, which may inadvertently grant
  access to the Kubernetes API. Disabling this feature for default service accounts
  reduces the chance of token misuse if a pod is compromised. Implementing this rule
  helps in adhering to best practices for Kubernetes security, ensuring compliance
  with security standards, and safeguarding sensitive operations within the cluster.
