rule_id: ibm.containers.worker_pool.containers_node_pool_disk_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Disk Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Worker Pools
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling disk encryption for worker pools in IBM Cloud is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data stored on disk from unauthorized access. Without encryption, data
  at rest is vulnerable to compromise in the event of a security breach, leading to
  potential data loss and non-compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks whether disk encryption is enabled for the node pools
  within IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service worker pools. By ensuring encryption at rest,
  this rule helps safeguard data integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk
  of data breaches. Enabling disk encryption aligns with industry best practices and
  assists in meeting regulatory compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby
  enhancing overall data protection and privacy measures.
