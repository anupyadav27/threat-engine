title: Ensure Regular Audit of Kubernetes Service Account Tokens
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Regular auditing of Kubernetes service account tokens is crucial for identifying
  unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Such audits help ensure that
  only authorized entities have access to critical container resources, thus reducing
  the risk of data leakage and maintaining the integrity of the container environment.
  By maintaining a trail of access activities, organizations can quickly respond to
  suspicious activities and comply with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks for the implementation of audit logging for Kubernetes
  service account tokens within IBM Cloud. It ensures that all access and usage of
  service account credentials are recorded and monitored. By enabling detailed logging,
  organizations can detect anomalies and unauthorized access attempts, providing a
  comprehensive security posture for containerized applications. This practice not
  only enhances the security of the cloud environment but also aids in meeting compliance
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require detailed access logging and monitoring.
