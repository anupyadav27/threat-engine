title: Enforce Image Registry Allowlist for Secure Container Deployments
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing an image registry allowlist for container deployments is crucial
  to maintaining a secure and controlled environment within IBM Cloud. It ensures
  that only vetted and trusted container images are deployed, reducing the risk of
  introducing vulnerabilities and malicious code. This practice also aligns with compliance
  requirements by ensuring that software deployments adhere to organizational security
  policies, thereby minimizing the potential for data breaches or service disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that the cluster's admission controller is configured
  to enforce an image registry allowlist, which restricts container deployments to
  pre-approved registries. By implementing this control, organizations can prevent
  unauthorized and potentially harmful images from being deployed in their environment.
  This enhances the security posture by ensuring that only images from trusted sources
  are used, which helps in maintaining integrity and compliance with industry standards.
  The practice also facilitates audits and security monitoring by creating a clear
  record of authorized image sources.
