rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.namespace_resource_verification_enabled
title: Ensuring Namespace Resource Verification in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Namespace Resource Verification is crucial for maintaining a secure
  and compliant container environment. This feature helps prevent unauthorized resource
  consumption and potential security vulnerabilities by ensuring that resource requests
  and limits are properly defined and adhered to within Kubernetes namespaces. It
  ultimately protects against resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks, which
  can affect application performance and business continuity.
description: This rule checks whether Namespace Resource Verification is enabled on
  IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By ensuring this setting is active, the rule verifies
  that all namespaces within the cluster adhere to predefined resource requests and
  limits, thereby enforcing resource governance. This practice enhances security by
  preventing unregulated resource usage, ensuring fair resource allocation, and reducing
  the risk of rogue applications consuming excessive resources. Additionally, it aids
  in compliance with organizational policies and industry standards related to resource
  management and security.
