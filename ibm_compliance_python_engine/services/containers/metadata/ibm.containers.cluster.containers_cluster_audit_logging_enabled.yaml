title: Enable Audit Logging for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters is crucial for
  maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. It allows organizations to
  monitor and record activities within the cluster, providing essential visibility
  into user actions and system events. This capability is vital for detecting unauthorized
  access attempts, understanding the sequence of events leading to security incidents,
  and ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is activated for Kubernetes clusters
  within IBM Cloud. Audit logging captures detailed records of API calls and user
  activities, which are crucial for forensic analysis and incident response. By enabling
  this feature, organizations can enhance their security posture by ensuring comprehensive
  visibility into cluster operations and user interactions. Furthermore, it supports
  compliance with various industry standards and regulations that mandate logging
  and monitoring of critical systems, thereby reducing the risk of non-compliance
  penalties.
