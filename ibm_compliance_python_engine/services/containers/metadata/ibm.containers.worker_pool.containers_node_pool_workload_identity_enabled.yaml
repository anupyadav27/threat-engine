rule_id: ibm.containers.worker_pool.containers_node_pool_workload_identity_enabled
title: Ensure Workload Identity is Enabled for Containers Node Pools
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling workload identity for containers node pools enhances security
  by ensuring that containers only access cloud services with the least privilege
  necessary. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  thus maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Implementing
  workload identity aligns with compliance requirements and supports secure access
  management practices.
description: This rule verifies that workload identity is enabled for Kubernetes node
  pools in IBM Cloud. By enabling workload identity, the node pools leverage IAM roles
  to limit access to only the necessary resources and services. This configuration
  helps maintain a secure environment by preventing unauthorized access and reducing
  the attack surface. It also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards
  that mandate secure identity and access management practices. Enabling workload
  identity is a critical step in ensuring that applications within your containers
  operate securely and in accordance with best practices.
