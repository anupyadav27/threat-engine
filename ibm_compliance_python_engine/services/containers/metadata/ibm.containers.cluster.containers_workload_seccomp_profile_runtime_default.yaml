title: Enforce Default Seccomp Profiles for Container Workloads in IBM Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Using the default Seccomp profile for container workloads enhances security
  by restricting system calls that containers can make, significantly reducing the
  attack surface. This practice is essential for mitigating potential exploitation
  risks and ensuring that containers run with the least privilege necessary, thus
  maintaining the integrity and reliability of applications in a business environment.
description: This rule ensures that all containers within an IBM Cloud Kubernetes
  cluster are configured to use the default Seccomp profile. It verifies that the
  Seccomp profile is set to 'RuntimeDefault', which enforces a baseline policy restricting
  system calls to only those needed for basic operation. Implementing this configuration
  not only enhances security by minimizing attack vectors but also aligns with industry
  compliance standards such as CIS Benchmarks. By adhering to this policy, organizations
  can safeguard their cloud-native applications against potential exploits while maintaining
  compliance with best practices.
