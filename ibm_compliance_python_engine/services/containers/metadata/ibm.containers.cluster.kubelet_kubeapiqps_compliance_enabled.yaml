rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_kubeapiqps_compliance_enabled
title: Enforce Kubelet Kubeapiqps Compliance for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that the Kubelet Kubeapiqps compliance is enabled is critical
  for maintaining control over API server requests, which helps prevent denial-of-service
  (DoS) attacks within Kubernetes clusters. By adhering to this compliance requirement,
  organizations can enhance the stability and security of containerized applications,
  thereby reducing the risk of service disruptions and potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether the Kubelet Kubeapiqps compliance is enabled
  across Kubernetes clusters within IBM Cloud. Kubelet Kubeapiqps compliance involves
  setting a rate limit on API requests from Kubelets to the Kubernetes API server,
  thereby minimizing the chances of overwhelming the server with excessive requests.
  Enabling this compliance is a best practice for preventing DoS attacks and ensuring
  optimal performance of the cluster. It also aligns with broader security monitoring
  initiatives, helping organizations meet regulatory and internal compliance standards.
