title: Enforce Read-Only Root Filesystem for Container Workloads
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that container workloads operate with a read-only root filesystem
  is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized modifications and potential exploitation
  of containers. By restricting write access, this rule helps prevent attackers from
  tampering with the filesystem to install malicious software or alter configurations,
  thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the container environment. Implementing
  this security measure can significantly reduce the attack surface, safeguarding
  sensitive data and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
description: This security rule checks whether the root filesystem of container workloads
  within an IBM Cloud cluster is mounted as read-only. By enforcing a read-only root
  filesystem, it ensures that containers are immutable during runtime, which is a
  fundamental security best practice in containerized environments. This approach
  prevents unauthorized changes and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities within
  the container, enhancing overall security posture. Adhering to this rule not only
  aligns with compliance requirements but also ensures that containers remain consistent,
  reliable, and secure across deployments.
