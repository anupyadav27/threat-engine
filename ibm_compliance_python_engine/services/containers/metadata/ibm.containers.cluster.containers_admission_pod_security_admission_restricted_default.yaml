title: Enforce Restricted Default Pod Security Admission in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing a restricted default pod security admission policy is crucial
  to safeguard Kubernetes clusters from potential threats posed by untrusted or misconfigured
  workloads. By implementing stringent security controls, organizations can mitigate
  risks such as privilege escalation, unauthorized access, and resource misuse, thereby
  preserving the integrity and availability of containerized applications. Adhering
  to this rule helps maintain compliance with security standards and best practices,
  reducing the likelihood of security breaches and their associated business impacts.
description: This security rule ensures that Kubernetes clusters within the IBM Cloud
  enforce a restricted default setting for pod security admission. The rule checks
  for compliance with Kubernetes Pod Security Standards by ensuring that pods are
  subject to restricted security policies, which limit their capabilities and interactions
  within the cluster. This measure prevents the deployment of pods with elevated privileges
  or insecure configurations, thereby enhancing the security posture of the container
  environment. By adhering to this policy, organizations can achieve better alignment
  with industry compliance requirements and reduce the attack surface of their containerized
  applications.
