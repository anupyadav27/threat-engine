title: Ensure NodeRestriction Admission Plugin is Enabled in Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the NodeRestriction admission plugin is crucial for securing Kubernetes
  clusters by ensuring that nodes can only modify their own resources. This measure
  prevents unauthorized access and modification of resources by compromised nodes,
  thereby maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the cluster's operations.
  By implementing this rule, organizations can reduce the risk of insider threats
  and potential breaches, aligning with best practices for secure container orchestration.
description: The NodeRestriction admission plugin is a critical security feature that
  restricts nodes to modifying only their own Node and Pod objects. This rule checks
  whether the NodeRestriction plugin is enabled in the cluster's API server configuration.
  By enforcing this restriction, it mitigates the risk of privilege escalation attacks
  where a compromised node could alter other nodes or pods, which could lead to unauthorized
  access or data breaches. Enabling this plugin also helps organizations to comply
  with various security standards and frameworks that require stringent access controls
  within Kubernetes environments.
