rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kubelet_cert_rotation_enabled
title: Ensure Kubelet Certificate Rotation is Enabled for Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Kubelet certificate rotation is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and security of Kubernetes clusters. It reduces the risk of certificate-related
  vulnerabilities by automatically renewing certificates, thereby minimizing the window
  of exposure to potential attacks. This enhances the overall security posture of
  the cluster, ensuring continued compliance with security best practices and regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Kubelet certificate rotation is enabled within
  IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By automating the renewal process of Kubelet certificates,
  this feature helps safeguard against unauthorized access and potential compromise
  of the cluster's node communication. Enabling certificate rotation aligns with security
  best practices by ensuring that certificates do not become obsolete, which could
  otherwise lead to exposure of sensitive data or unauthorized system access. Regular
  certificate rotation is also a critical compliance measure for adhering to industry
  standards and regulatory frameworks that mandate the use of up-to-date security
  protocols.
