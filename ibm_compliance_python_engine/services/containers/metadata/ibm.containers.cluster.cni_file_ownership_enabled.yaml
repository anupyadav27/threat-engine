rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.cni_file_ownership_enabled
title: Enforce CNI File Ownership for Secure Kubernetes Operations
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring proper file ownership for Container Network Interface (CNI) files
  is crucial in maintaining the integrity and security of Kubernetes clusters. Misconfigured
  file permissions can lead to unauthorized access or modifications, potentially resulting
  in compromised network configurations that could disrupt operations or expose sensitive
  data. By enabling CNI file ownership, organizations safeguard their container environments,
  ensuring compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that CNI plugin files within the Kubernetes cluster
  have the correct ownership, preventing unauthorized modifications that could alter
  network configurations. By enforcing strict file ownership, the rule mitigates the
  risk of malicious actors tampering with network settings, thereby enhancing the
  overall security posture of the container environment. Implementing this rule aligns
  with industry standards for container security, offering compliance benefits by
  adhering to frameworks that mandate secure management of Kubernetes components.
