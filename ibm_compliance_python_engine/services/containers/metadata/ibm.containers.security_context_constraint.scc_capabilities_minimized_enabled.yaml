title: Enforce Minimized SCC Capabilities for Enhanced Container Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that container security contexts have minimized capabilities is
  crucial for reducing the attack surface and mitigating potential security breaches.
  By restricting unnecessary capabilities, organizations can prevent privilege escalation
  and unauthorized access, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining operational
  integrity. This proactive measure aligns with best practices in container security
  management, safeguarding business operations by minimizing vulnerabilities.
description: This rule verifies that the security context constraints (SCC) for IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes Service have minimized capabilities enabled. By limiting capabilities,
  this rule ensures that containers operate with the least privilege necessary, reducing
  the possibility of exploitation of elevated permissions. Implementing minimized
  SCC capabilities enhances the overall security posture of containerized environments
  by preventing privilege-related attacks and complying with various security frameworks
  and regulations. This practice not only fortifies the security framework but also
  supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
