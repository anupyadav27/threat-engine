rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.admission_control_serviceaccount_enabled
title: Ensure Admission Control ServiceAccount is Enabled in IBM Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Admission Control ServiceAccount in IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters
  is crucial for enforcing security policies and ensuring that only authorized service
  accounts can perform specific actions within the cluster. This configuration minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of resources, safeguarding
  sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity.
description: This rule verifies that the Admission Control ServiceAccount feature
  is enabled within your IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By enabling this feature,
  you enhance security by ensuring that all operations performed by service accounts
  are subject to predefined admission policies. This practice helps to enforce compliance
  with organizational security standards and reduces the risk of privilege escalation
  by ensuring that service accounts operate within their intended scope. Such configurations
  are essential for maintaining a secure and compliant Kubernetes environment.
