rule_id: ibm.containers.security_context_constraint.scc_host_ipc_restriction_enabled
title: Ensure Host IPC Restriction is Enabled for Kubernetes SCC
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling host IPC restriction in Kubernetes Security Context Constraints
  (SCC) mitigates the risk of Pod-to-Host and Pod-to-Pod communication that could
  lead to unauthorized data access or privilege escalation. This setting helps maintain
  the integrity and confidentiality of containerized applications by isolating their
  processes from the host and other containers.
description: This rule checks whether the Security Context Constraint (SCC) for Kubernetes
  clusters on IBM Cloud has host IPC (Inter-Process Communication) restrictions enabled.
  By enforcing this restriction, containers are prevented from using the host's IPC
  namespace, which reduces the attack surface for malicious activities and ensures
  that containers operate in a confined environment. This enhances the security posture
  of your Kubernetes workloads and aids in compliance with best practices and regulations
  that demand strict isolation and resource control within cloud environments.
