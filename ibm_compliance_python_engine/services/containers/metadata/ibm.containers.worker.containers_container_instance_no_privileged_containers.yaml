rule_id: ibm.containers.worker.containers_container_instance_no_privileged_containers
title: Enforce Non-Privileged Containers in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Worker Nodes
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that containers do not run with privileged access is crucial for
  maintaining a secure container environment. Privileged containers can bypass security
  restrictions, leading to potential unauthorized access to the underlying host system.
  This can result in data breaches, non-compliance with regulatory standards, and
  significant business risks.
description: This security rule checks for the absence of privileged containers running
  on IBM Cloud Kubernetes worker nodes. By enforcing this rule, you prevent containers
  from gaining elevated access permissions that could compromise the host system's
  integrity. Implementing non-privileged containers aligns with the principle of least
  privilege, reducing the attack surface and improving resilience against potential
  exploits. Compliance with this rule aids in meeting various security standards and
  frameworks, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of your cloud environment.
