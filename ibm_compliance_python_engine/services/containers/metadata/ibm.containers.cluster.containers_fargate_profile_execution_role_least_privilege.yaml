title: Ensure Least Privilege for Containers Fargate Profile Execution Role
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for execution roles in containers is crucial
  to minimize potential attack vectors and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
  resources. By ensuring that Fargate profile execution roles have only the permissions
  necessary for their function, organizations can protect critical data and maintain
  operational integrity, reducing the risk of data breaches and financial impact from
  compromised environments.
description: This rule checks that the execution roles associated with Fargate profiles
  in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service are configured with the principle of least privilege.
  It ensures that the roles have only the permissions needed to execute their specific
  tasks and no more. This practice is vital to restrict access to resources, thereby
  enhancing the overall security posture. Adhering to this rule helps organizations
  align with compliance frameworks such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and others that mandate
  strict access controls and identity management, ensuring both security and regulatory
  adherence.
