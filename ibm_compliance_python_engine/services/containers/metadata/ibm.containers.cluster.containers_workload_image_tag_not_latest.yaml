rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_workload_image_tag_not_latest
title: Ensure Containers Do Not Use 'Latest' Image Tag for Workload Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Using the 'latest' tag for container images can lead to unpredictable behavior
  and potential security vulnerabilities. It makes it difficult to track changes and
  ensure that all environment instances are running the expected versions. This can
  result in inconsistencies across development, testing, and production environments,
  increasing the risk of deploying insecure or unstable software.
description: This rule checks if container workloads within a Kubernetes cluster on
  IBM Cloud are using the 'latest' tag for their images. Avoiding the 'latest' tag
  helps maintain version control and ensures that specific, tested, and secure image
  versions are deployed. By enforcing the use of specific version tags, organizations
  can improve the auditability and traceability of their container deployments, thus
  enhancing overall security posture and compliance with best practices in container
  management.
