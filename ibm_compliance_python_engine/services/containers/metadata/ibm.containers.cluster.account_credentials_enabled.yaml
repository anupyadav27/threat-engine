rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.account_credentials_enabled
title: Ensure Account Credentials are Disabled in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling account credentials on Kubernetes clusters can lead to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. By ensuring these credentials are disabled,
  organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of their containerized
  applications, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents that could affect
  business operations.
description: This rule evaluates IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters to verify that account
  credentials are not enabled, which could otherwise allow unauthorized users access
  to critical resources. By disabling account credentials, you enhance the security
  posture of your Kubernetes environment, mitigating risks associated with compromised
  credentials. This practice aligns with compliance standards such as CIS Kubernetes
  Benchmarks, which mandate controlling access to cluster resources to prevent unauthorized
  actions.
