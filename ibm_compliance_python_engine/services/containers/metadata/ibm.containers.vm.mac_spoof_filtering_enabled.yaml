rule_id: ibm.containers.vm.mac_spoof_filtering_enabled
title: Ensure MAC Spoof Filtering is Enabled on IBM Cloud VMs
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling MAC spoof filtering is crucial to prevent unauthorized network
  access and to maintain the integrity of network communications in a cloud environment.
  This control helps mitigate the risk of MAC address spoofing attacks, where an attacker
  could impersonate a legitimate device to intercept, alter, or disrupt data flows.
  By ensuring MAC spoof filtering is enabled, organizations can protect sensitive
  data and maintain compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks that MAC spoof filtering is activated on virtual machines
  (VMs) within IBM Cloud container environments. Enabling MAC spoof filtering ensures
  that only legitimate MAC addresses are allowed to communicate over the network,
  effectively blocking potential spoofing attempts. This enhances the security of
  the network by maintaining the authenticity and reliability of device communications.
  Compliance with this rule helps organizations adhere to best practices in compute
  and workload security, contributing to a robust security posture and aligning with
  regulatory requirements.
