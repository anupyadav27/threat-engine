title: Ensuring Namespace Isolation in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling namespace isolation in Kubernetes clusters is crucial for maintaining
  a secure and organized environment. It minimizes the risk of unauthorized access
  and data breaches by ensuring that resources and workloads are restricted to their
  designated namespaces. This isolation is vital for compliance with industry standards
  and protecting sensitive business operations.
description: This rule checks whether namespace isolation is enabled in your IBM Cloud
  Kubernetes clusters. Namespace isolation is a security measure that confines the
  interactions and visibility of resources to their specific namespaces, preventing
  cross-namespace access unless explicitly allowed. By ensuring namespace isolation,
  organizations can achieve improved security by limiting access and influence of
  applications and services to their respective namespaces. This practice supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements by reducing the attack surface and preventing
  unauthorized data access within a multi-tenancy environment.
