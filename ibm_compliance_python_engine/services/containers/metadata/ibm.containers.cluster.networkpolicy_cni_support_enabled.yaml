title: Ensuring NetworkPolicy CNI Support in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling NetworkPolicy CNI support in IBM Cloud Kubernetes clusters is
  critical for managing and enforcing network security policies. This measure helps
  protect workloads by controlling traffic flow between pods, thereby reducing the
  risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Ensuring network policies are enabled
  aligns with best practices for securing containerized environments, ultimately safeguarding
  sensitive business operations and data.
description: This rule verifies that the Container Network Interface (CNI) support
  for NetworkPolicy is enabled within IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters. By enforcing
  network policies, administrators can define rules that dictate the ingress and egress
  traffic to and from pods, thereby enhancing the cluster's security posture. Enabling
  this feature ensures compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements,
  as it provides a mechanism to isolate and protect applications from potential threats
  and vulnerabilities in the network layer.
