rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster_addon.containers_addon_from_trusted_channel
title: Enforce Use of Trusted Channels for Container Addon Deployment
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that container addons are deployed from trusted channels is crucial
  to maintaining the integrity and security of your Kubernetes clusters. This practice
  mitigates the risk of introducing vulnerabilities or malicious components that could
  compromise the cluster's security posture. By adhering to trusted sources, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks whether container addons in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
  are sourced from trusted channels. By enforcing this rule, organizations can guarantee
  that only vetted and secure addons are deployed, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities
  and potential exploits. This practice not only strengthens the overall security
  of the Kubernetes environment but also aligns with industry best practices and regulatory
  compliance requirements for secure software supply chains. Regular monitoring and
  audits of addon sources are recommended to maintain compliance and security posture.
