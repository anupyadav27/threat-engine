title: Enforce Network Policy Allowlisting for Namespace Services in Clusters
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing network policies with allowlisting for namespace services
  is crucial for minimizing the attack surface of containerized applications. By restricting
  communication pathways to only those explicitly allowed, organizations can prevent
  unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of lateral movement within the cluster.
  This practice not only enhances security but also supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulatory requirements for data protection.
description: This rule checks if network policies are configured to allowlist communication
  specifically for services within a namespace in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)
  clusters. By enforcing such policies, administrators ensure that only predefined
  and necessary network traffic is permitted, thereby reducing the possibility of
  unauthorized access or data breaches. Implementing allowlists aligns with best practices
  for network segmentation and isolation, which are essential for maintaining a secure
  and compliant Kubernetes environment. Additionally, it aids in achieving compliance
  with frameworks that mandate strict access control measures.
