rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.scc_host_pid_restriction_enabled
title: Ensure SCC Host PID Restriction is Enabled in IBM Cloud Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the SCC Host PID Restriction prevents containers from accessing
  the host's process ID namespace, significantly reducing the risk of privilege escalation
  attacks. This restriction is crucial for maintaining a secure multi-tenant environment,
  as it prevents malicious actors from potentially interfering with or gaining insights
  into other processes running on the host, thereby protecting sensitive data and
  maintaining system integrity.
description: This rule verifies that the SCC Host PID Restriction is enabled on IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By ensuring this security context constraint, containers
  are restricted from sharing the host's process ID namespace, which mitigates threats
  such as process snooping and unauthorized process manipulation. Enforcing this constraint
  aligns with best practices for container security, enhancing the isolation between
  containerized workloads and improving the overall security posture of Kubernetes
  clusters. Adhering to this rule also assists organizations in meeting compliance
  requirements related to process isolation and data protection.
