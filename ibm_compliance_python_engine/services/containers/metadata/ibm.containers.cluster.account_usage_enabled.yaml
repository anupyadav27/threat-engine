rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.account_usage_enabled
title: Ensure Account Usage is Enabled for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling account usage monitoring on Kubernetes clusters in IBM Cloud is
  crucial for maintaining visibility into resource consumption and detecting potential
  security incidents. It helps organizations manage costs effectively while ensuring
  that unexpected usage patterns, which could indicate unauthorized access or configuration
  errors, are promptly identified and addressed.
description: This rule checks whether account usage monitoring is enabled for IBM
  Cloud Kubernetes clusters. By monitoring usage metrics, organizations can ensure
  that cluster resources are being utilized as intended and that there are no anomalies
  that could signal security issues. This proactive approach not only aids in cost
  management but also strengthens the security posture by providing insights into
  potential misconfigurations or unauthorized access. Compliance with this rule supports
  adherence to best practices and regulatory requirements for cloud resource management.
