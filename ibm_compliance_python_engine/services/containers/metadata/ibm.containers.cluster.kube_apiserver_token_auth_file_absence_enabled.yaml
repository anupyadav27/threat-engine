rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.kube_apiserver_token_auth_file_absence_enabled
title: Ensure Kube Apiserver Token Auth File is Disabled for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Disabling the Kube Apiserver Token Auth File mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access by ensuring that authentication tokens are not stored in a file that could
  be compromised. This helps prevent attackers from gaining access to the Kubernetes
  API server, safeguarding sensitive workloads and maintaining the integrity of the
  cluster.
description: This rule checks whether the Kube Apiserver Token Auth File is disabled
  in your IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster. By ensuring the absence of a token
  auth file, the rule promotes the use of more secure authentication methods, such
  as OAuth or client certificates, which provide stronger access control mechanisms.
  This practice enhances the overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment
  and aids in compliance with security standards that mandate robust access management
  processes.
