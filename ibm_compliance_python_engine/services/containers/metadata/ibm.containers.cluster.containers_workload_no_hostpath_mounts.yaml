rule_id: ibm.containers.cluster.containers_workload_no_hostpath_mounts
title: Ensure Containers Workload Avoids HostPath Mounts in Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Prohibiting HostPath volume mounts in container workloads is crucial for
  maintaining a secure and controlled environment within IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.
  HostPath mounts enable containers to access the host filesystem directly, potentially
  leading to security risks such as unauthorized data exposure, privilege escalation,
  and configuration tampering. Minimizing such risks helps protect sensitive data
  and ensures the integrity of the containerized applications.
description: This rule checks for the presence of HostPath volume mounts in container
  workloads within a cluster, which can pose significant security threats by granting
  containers direct access to the host filesystem. By ensuring that no HostPath mounts
  are used, organizations can mitigate risks associated with privilege escalation
  and data leakage, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of their Kubernetes
  environments. Adhering to this rule also supports compliance with security standards
  that advocate for isolation between container workloads and the host system, contributing
  to a more robust and trustworthy cloud infrastructure.
