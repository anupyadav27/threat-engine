title: Ensure Public Access is Blocked for IBM Watson Discovery Service
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to the IBM Watson Discovery service is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized data exposure, which could lead to data breaches and potential
  misuse of sensitive information. By ensuring that only authenticated and authorized
  users can access the service, organizations can maintain data integrity and confidentiality,
  reducing the risk of compliance violations and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM Watson Discovery service is configured
  to block public access, ensuring that data is only accessible to authenticated users
  within the organization's network. Implementing this rule enhances the security
  posture by preventing unauthorized external access, safeguarding sensitive data
  from potential exposure or misuse. By aligning with best practices in identity and
  access management, this rule not only strengthens security but also aids in meeting
  regulatory compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict access
  controls.
