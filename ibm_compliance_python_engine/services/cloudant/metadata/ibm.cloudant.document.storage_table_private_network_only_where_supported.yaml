title: Enforce Private Network Access for Cloudant Storage Tables
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private network access for Cloudant storage tables is crucial
  for minimizing exposure to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By restricting
  access to private networks, businesses can ensure that only trusted entities within
  their network can interact with sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of data
  leaks or unauthorized modifications and maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule ensures that Cloudant storage tables are accessible only via
  private networks where supported, by checking if network access controls are correctly
  configured to block public internet access. By implementing such controls, organizations
  can enhance their security posture by limiting the attack surface and protecting
  data integrity. Compliance with this rule helps in adhering to industry best practices
  for network security and supports regulatory requirements for data protection, ensuring
  that sensitive data is shielded from external threats.
