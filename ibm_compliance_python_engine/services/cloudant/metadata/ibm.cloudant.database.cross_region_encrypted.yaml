title: Ensuring Cross-Region Encryption for IBM Cloudant Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Cross-region encryption is crucial for protecting sensitive data as it
  is replicated across different geographic locations. This measure mitigates the
  risk of unauthorized data access during transit and storage, ensuring that data
  integrity and confidentiality are maintained across distributed environments. Businesses
  can avoid potential legal and financial repercussions by adhering to industry regulations
  and standards.
description: This rule verifies that all IBM Cloudant databases have encryption enabled
  when data is replicated across different regions. By ensuring encryption at rest,
  organizations can safeguard sensitive information from potential breaches or unauthorized
  access, thereby maintaining data privacy. This practice not only enhances the overall
  security posture but also aids in achieving compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate robust encryption mechanisms for sensitive
  data.
