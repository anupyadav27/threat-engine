title: Enforce Least Privilege RBAC in IBM Cloudant Document Storage
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in IBM Cloudant's document storage
  is crucial for minimizing security risks associated with unauthorized data access.
  By assigning only necessary permissions, organizations can significantly reduce
  the potential for data breaches, ensuring sensitive information is accessible only
  to those with a legitimate need, thereby protecting business assets and maintaining
  customer trust.
description: This rule examines the role-based access control (RBAC) configurations
  for IBM Cloudant document storage to ensure adherence to the principle of least
  privilege. It verifies that permissions granted to users and services are strictly
  aligned with their job functions and responsibilities. Proper RBAC implementation
  enhances security by limiting access to critical resources, which helps in maintaining
  compliance with regulatory standards and best practices, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  by safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access.
