title: Ensuring Autoscaling is Enabled for IBM Cloudant Resources
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling autoscaling for IBM Cloudant resources is crucial for maintaining
  service availability and performance in dynamic cloud environments. It ensures that
  the database can automatically adjust resource allocation to handle varying workloads,
  preventing performance bottlenecks and potential service disruptions, which can
  impact business operations and customer satisfaction.
description: This rule checks that autoscaling is enabled for IBM Cloudant resources
  within your cloud environment. By activating autoscaling, the system can automatically
  scale resources up or down based on demand, optimizing performance and cost-efficiency.
  This proactive scaling capability is not only beneficial for maintaining seamless
  operations but also aligns with best practices for cloud resource management and
  compliance with industry standards. It aids in safeguarding against unexpected spikes
  in usage, which could lead to service degradation or outages if resources are inadequately
  provisioned.
