rule_id: ibm.cloudant.database.encryption_at_rest_all_regions
title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for Cloudant Databases in All Regions
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encryption at rest is essential for protecting sensitive data stored in
  Cloudant databases from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that data is encrypted at rest across all regions, organizations can safeguard their
  information against physical theft and unauthorized access, enhancing their compliance
  posture with industry regulations and standards.
description: This rule verifies that all Cloudant databases are configured to use
  encryption at rest across all operational regions. It checks that the appropriate
  encryption settings are enabled to protect stored data, thereby improving data confidentiality
  and integrity. Implementing encryption at rest is a critical component of a comprehensive
  data protection strategy, ensuring that data remains secure even if the physical
  storage media is compromised. This practice also aids in meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate robust data protection measures.
