title: Ensure In-Transit Encryption for IBM Cloudant Clusters
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling in-transit encryption for IBM Cloudant clusters is crucial for
  protecting sensitive data as it travels over networks. Without encryption, data
  could be intercepted by unauthorized entities, leading to potential data breaches.
  This practice not only safeguards data integrity and confidentiality but also ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements, thereby enhancing
  customer trust and business reputation.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloudant clusters have in-transit encryption
  enabled, ensuring that all data moving between clients and the database is encrypted
  using protocols like TLS. Enabling this security measure prevents unauthorized access
  and eavesdropping on the network, reducing the risk of data interception. By adhering
  to this rule, organizations can maintain robust data protection strategies, fulfill
  compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA, and demonstrate a commitment to securing
  customer data.
