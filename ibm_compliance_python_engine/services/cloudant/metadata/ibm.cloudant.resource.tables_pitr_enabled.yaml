title: Ensure Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) is Enabled for Cloudant Tables
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) for Cloudant tables is crucial for
  safeguarding data integrity and ensuring business continuity. This feature allows
  organizations to recover data to any previous point, thereby minimizing data loss
  in the event of accidental deletions, corruption, or other data integrity issues.
  Ensuring PITR is enabled not only aligns with best practices for disaster recovery
  but also supports compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) is enabled for
  all Cloudant tables, enhancing the organization's ability to recover data efficiently.
  By enabling PITR, each change made to the tables is recorded, allowing for precise
  data restoration to any specific point in time. This is especially beneficial for
  maintaining data integrity and can be crucial for meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR or HIPAA, which mandate stringent data recovery capabilities. Implementing
  PITR helps in reducing the risk of data loss and ensures that critical business
  operations can resume swiftly after a data-related incident.
