title: Ensure Cloudant Resource Backup is Enabled for Disaster Recovery
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Enabling backups for Cloudant resources is essential for safeguarding data
  against loss due to accidental deletion, corruption, or malicious activities. Without
  backups, businesses risk losing critical data, which can result in operational disruptions,
  financial loss, and reputational damage. Regular backups are a cornerstone of a
  robust disaster recovery strategy, ensuring business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that backup is enabled for IBM Cloudant resources
  to ensure data resilience and availability. By having backups configured, organizations
  can quickly recover from incidents that compromise data integrity or availability.
  Enforcing backup policies enhances security posture by mitigating risks of data
  loss and aligning with compliance standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2, which mandate
  effective data protection strategies.
