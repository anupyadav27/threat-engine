rule_id: ibm.cloudant.resource.pitr_enabled
title: Ensure Point-in-Time Recovery (PiTR) is Enabled for Cloudant Resources
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PiTR) for IBM Cloudant databases enhances
  data resilience by allowing restoration to a specific state at any point within
  the retention period. This capability mitigates the risks associated with accidental
  deletions or data corruption, ensuring business continuity and compliance with data
  protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled for IBM Cloudant
  instances, a critical feature that allows databases to be restored to any state
  within a configured time window. Enabling PiTR ensures that data can be recovered
  in cases of data loss, corruption, or malicious activity, thereby protecting the
  integrity and availability of the information. Compliance with this rule aids in
  meeting regulatory requirements for data protection and disaster recovery, enhancing
  the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
