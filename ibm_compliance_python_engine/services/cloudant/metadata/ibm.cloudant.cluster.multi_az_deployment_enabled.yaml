title: Ensure Multi-AZ Deployment is Enabled for Cloudant Clusters
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment is crucial for enhancing the resilience
  and availability of your Cloudant clusters by distributing resources across multiple
  data centers. This configuration mitigates the risk of service disruption due to
  data center failures or unexpected outages, thereby ensuring continuous availability
  of critical business applications and protecting against potential data loss.
description: This rule checks whether Cloudant clusters are configured for Multi-AZ
  deployment, which involves distributing resources across multiple availability zones
  within a region. Enabling this feature enhances the fault tolerance of the database
  service, as it allows for automatic failover and load balancing across zones. By
  adhering to this best practice, organizations can improve their security posture
  and ensure compliance with industry standards that require robust disaster recovery
  and business continuity plans.
