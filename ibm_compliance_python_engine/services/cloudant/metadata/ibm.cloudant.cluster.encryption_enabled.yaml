title: Ensure Data Encryption at Rest for Cloudant Clusters
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for Cloudant clusters is essential for safeguarding
  sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential breaches. This practice
  not only protects the integrity and confidentiality of stored data but also helps
  organizations comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, thereby
  minimizing legal risks and enhancing customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for all
  Cloudant clusters within the IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring that data is encrypted
  when stored, the rule mitigates the risk of data exposure in the event of unauthorized
  access or system compromise. The implementation of encryption at rest strengthens
  the overall security posture and assists in meeting compliance mandates such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data protection measures. It checks for the
  presence of encryption configurations in the Cloudant service, ensuring that all
  data stored within these clusters is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
