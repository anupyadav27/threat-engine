title: Ensure Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is Enabled for Cloudant Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for Cloudant databases is crucial
  for data integrity and business continuity. It allows organizations to restore databases
  to any point within a retention period, mitigating data loss risks due to human
  errors, malicious attacks, or system failures, thereby ensuring compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is enabled
  for IBM Cloudant databases where the feature is supported. PITR provides a robust
  mechanism for data recovery by allowing database states to be restored to any point
  in time within a specified retention window. By enabling PITR, organizations enhance
  their data protection strategy, ensuring that encryption at rest is complemented
  with recovery capabilities, which is essential for meeting regulatory compliance
  and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or accidental deletion. This
  rule is aligned with best practices for data protection and privacy within the scope
  of cloudant.database.security.
