title: Ensure Cloudant Tables Use KMS Customer-Managed Key Encryption
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) Customer-Managed Key (CMK) encryption
  for Cloudant tables is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized
  access. This practice enhances data protection by allowing organizations to manage
  their encryption keys, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining
  control over data security.
description: This security rule checks whether Cloudant tables have encryption enabled
  using IBM Key Management Service (KMS) with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs). By leveraging
  CMK encryption, organizations can enforce strict access controls and maintain transparency
  over their data encryption practices. This configuration aligns with industry standards
  for data protection and privacy, offering enhanced security by minimizing the risk
  of data breaches and supporting regulatory compliance such as GDPR and HIPAA.
