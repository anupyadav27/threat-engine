title: Ensure Cloudant Database Encryption and Activity Logging Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting Cloudant databases and enabling activity logging is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data and maintaining transparency in data access and modifications.
  This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and ensures compliance
  with data protection regulations, safeguarding the organization's reputation and
  avoiding potential legal consequences.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloudant databases have encryption at rest
  enabled and that activity logging is configured through IBM Activity Tracker with
  LogDNA or CloudWatch. By ensuring encryption at rest, data is protected against
  unauthorized access and potential breaches, while activity logging provides a detailed
  audit trail of data access and modifications. This enhances the organization's security
  posture and supports compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS,
  which require robust data protection and privacy controls.
