rule_id: ibm.cloudant.key.protect_cmk_encryption_enabled
title: Enforce Cloudant CMK Encryption for Enhanced Data Security
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that Cloudant databases are encrypted using Customer Managed Keys
  (CMKs) is critical for protecting sensitive data against unauthorized access. By
  leveraging CMK encryption, organizations maintain control over the encryption keys,
  enhancing their ability to comply with regulatory requirements and mitigating risks
  associated with data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloudant databases are configured to use
  Customer Managed Keys (CMK) for encryption at rest, ensuring sensitive data is protected
  with robust security measures. Enabling CMK encryption allows organizations to manage
  and rotate encryption keys, providing greater control over data security. This practice
  not only strengthens the security posture by safeguarding data against unauthorized
  access but also assists in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate stringent data protection controls.
