title: Ensure Encryption and Audit Logging for IBM Cloudant Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption and audit logging for IBM Cloudant databases is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with
  industry standards. Encryption at rest safeguards data by rendering it unreadable
  to malicious actors, while audit logging provides a trail of activities that can
  be used for forensic analysis and regulatory compliance. This combination enhances
  the overall security posture by preventing data breaches and ensuring accountability.
description: This security rule verifies that IBM Cloudant databases have encryption
  enabled for data at rest and audit logging activated for IBM activity clusters.
  The encryption mechanism ensures that stored data is encrypted using strong algorithms,
  mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. Audit logging captures all significant
  actions and changes within the database cluster, providing a comprehensive activity
  log that is essential for identifying suspicious activities and maintaining compliance
  with data protection regulations. Implementing this rule helps organizations meet
  regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that sensitive data
  is protected and that there is a transparent record of all database interactions.
