title: Ensure Document Secrets Are Enabled in IBM Cloud Secrets Manager
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Enabling document secrets in IBM Cloud Secrets Manager is crucial for safeguarding
  sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Without this
  setting, unauthorized access to confidential data is more likely, potentially leading
  to data breaches that can harm organizational reputation and incur substantial financial
  penalties.
description: This rule verifies that document secrets are enabled in IBM Cloud Secrets
  Manager, ensuring that all sensitive information is stored securely and access is
  tightly controlled. By enabling document secrets, organizations leverage robust
  encryption and access management capabilities to protect data throughout its lifecycle.
  This practice not only enhances security posture but also aids in achieving compliance
  with industry standards like ISO 27001 and GDPR, which mandate stringent data protection
  measures.
