title: Ensure Automatic Secret Rotation is Enabled in IBM Secrets Manager
severity: medium
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Automatic secret rotation is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of sensitive data. By enabling this feature, organizations can minimize
  the risk of secrets being exposed due to prolonged use, thereby reducing the potential
  for unauthorized access and data breaches. Consistent rotation of secrets also aligns
  with best practices for compliance with security frameworks and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether automatic rotation is enabled for secrets managed
  within IBM Secrets Manager. Enabling automatic rotation ensures that secrets, such
  as API keys and credentials, are periodically updated without manual intervention,
  significantly reducing the window of opportunity for malicious actors to exploit
  stale secrets. This enhances overall security posture by ensuring secrets remain
  current and reduces administrative overhead. Additionally, it supports compliance
  with industry standards by enforcing regular updates to authentication mechanisms.
