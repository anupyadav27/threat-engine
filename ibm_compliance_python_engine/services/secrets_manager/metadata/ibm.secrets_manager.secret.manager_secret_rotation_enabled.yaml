title: Enforce Secret Rotation for Enhanced Security in IBM Secrets Manager
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Enabling secret rotation in IBM Secrets Manager is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. Regularly rotating secrets
  reduces the risk of exposure from compromised credentials, thereby mitigating potential
  unauthorized access and data breaches. This practice not only strengthens an organization's
  security posture but also aligns with regulatory compliance and industry standards.
description: This security rule checks whether secret rotation is enabled for resources
  managed by IBM Secrets Manager. By ensuring that secret keys are periodically rotated,
  organizations can minimize the window of opportunity for malicious actors to exploit
  compromised secrets. Implementing automated secret rotation enhances security by
  eliminating static credentials, thus reducing human error and operational overhead.
  Compliance with this rule supports adherence to best practices and regulatory requirements,
  such as GDPR and ISO 27001, ensuring a robust key management strategy.
