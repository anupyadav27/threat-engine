title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Privacy Consent Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for privacy consent functions within
  IBM Cloud's data virtualization services is critical to minimizing unauthorized
  data access risks. Restricting permissions to only those necessary for specific
  roles reduces the potential for data breaches and ensures compliance with privacy
  regulations, thereby protecting sensitive customer information and maintaining trust.
description: This rule ensures that access to governance and consent management functions
  within IBM Cloud's data virtualization service is restricted according to the principle
  of least privilege. It checks that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations
  limit user permissions to the minimum necessary for their roles. By enforcing this
  rule, organizations can prevent excessive access rights, which can lead to unauthorized
  data exposure. This practice not only strengthens overall security but also supports
  compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict
  data protection measures.
