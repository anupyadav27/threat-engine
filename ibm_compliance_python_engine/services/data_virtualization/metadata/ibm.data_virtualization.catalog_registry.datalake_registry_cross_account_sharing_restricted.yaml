title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Datalake Registry
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of the datalake registry is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By limiting data sharing
  to only authorized accounts, organizations can maintain data confidentiality and
  integrity, reducing the risk of data exposure and meeting compliance requirements.
description: This rule ensures that cross-account sharing of the datalake registry
  within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service is restricted. It checks configurations
  to verify that datalake registries are not shared with unauthorized accounts, which
  helps prevent unauthorized data access. Implementing this restriction enhances security
  by ensuring sensitive data remains within approved boundaries, thereby supporting
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Adhering to
  this rule protects the organization from potential data leaks and unauthorized data
  manipulation.
