title: Ensure Lineage Rule Version Pinned for Data Virtualization Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Pinning the version of lineage rule definitions ensures consistency and
  reliability in data governance processes. This practice mitigates risks associated
  with unintentional changes or updates that could compromise data lineage integrity,
  thus maintaining trust and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the lineage rule definitions within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service are version-pinned, ensuring that specific versions
  are used and not inadvertently altered. By enforcing version pinning, organizations
  can ensure that the lineage rules applied to their data remain consistent, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized changes that could affect data integrity and compliance.
  This approach not only enhances data protection but also facilitates adherence to
  industry standards regarding data privacy and encryption at rest.
