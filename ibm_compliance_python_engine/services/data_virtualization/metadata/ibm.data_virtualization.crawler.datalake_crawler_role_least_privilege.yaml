title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Crawler Roles in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for datalake crawler roles
  is crucial to minimizing potential attack surfaces within your IBM Cloud environment.
  By ensuring that these roles have only the permissions necessary to perform their
  functions, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized data access and potential
  data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive business information and maintaining
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the least privilege principle in assigning
  roles to datalake crawlers within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. Specifically,
  it verifies that the permissions granted to datalake crawler roles are restricted
  to only those necessary for their operational tasks. By implementing this rule,
  organizations enhance their security posture by ensuring that roles are not over-privileged,
  which in turn helps maintain compliance with industry standards and regulatory frameworks
  that mandate strict access controls.
