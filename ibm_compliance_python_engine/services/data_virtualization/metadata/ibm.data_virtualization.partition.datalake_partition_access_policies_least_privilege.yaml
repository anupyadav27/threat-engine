title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Partition Access Policies
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that access policies for data lake partitions adhere to the principle
  of least privilege is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized data access
  and potential data breaches. By restricting access permissions to the minimum necessary,
  organizations can protect sensitive data, maintain customer trust, and comply with
  regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that access policies for IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  partitions are configured to grant only the necessary permissions required for specific
  roles and users. It checks for overly permissive access settings that exceed the
  operational needs of the users or applications interacting with the data lake partitions.
  Implementing least privilege access controls enhances security by reducing the attack
  surface and helps organizations maintain compliance with data protection standards
  such as GDPR and CCPA.
