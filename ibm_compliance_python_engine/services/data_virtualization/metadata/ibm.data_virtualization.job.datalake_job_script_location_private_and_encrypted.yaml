rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.datalake_job_script_location_private_and_encrypted
title: Ensure Private and Encrypted Datalake Job Script Storage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting datalake job scripts by ensuring their storage location is both
  private and encrypted is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This measure safeguards sensitive business logic and intellectual property embedded
  within job scripts, thereby maintaining organizational integrity and compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the storage location of datalake job scripts
  within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service is configured to be private and encrypted.
  By enforcing encryption at rest, the rule mitigates risks associated with unauthorized
  data access, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve and execute these
  scripts. This practice aligns with industry standards for data protection and helps
  organizations meet compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA by safeguarding
  sensitive data against potential threats.
