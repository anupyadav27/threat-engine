title: Ensure Datalake Database Encryption at Rest for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting datalake databases at rest is vital to safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access and potential breaches. This measure minimizes
  the risk of data exposure in the event of physical theft or unauthorized access
  to storage media. Implementing robust encryption practices aligns with regulatory
  compliance standards, thereby mitigating compliance-related risks and enhancing
  the organization’s reputation in data protection.
description: This rule verifies that all datalake databases within the IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization service are encrypted at rest. It checks for the implementation of
  encryption mechanisms, ensuring that data stored in these databases is protected
  using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This encryption strategy strengthens
  data confidentiality and integrity, providing a crucial layer of defense against
  potential data breaches. By adhering to encryption best practices, organizations
  meet compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations,
  thus avoiding potential legal and financial penalties.
