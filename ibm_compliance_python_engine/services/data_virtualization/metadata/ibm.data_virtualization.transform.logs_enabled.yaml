title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization Transform Operations
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for transform operations in IBM Data Virtualization is
  crucial for maintaining visibility into data handling processes. It helps in detecting
  unauthorized access and modifications, facilitating timely incident response. Moreover,
  logging supports audit and compliance requirements by providing a traceable record
  of activities, which is essential for regulatory adherence.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for transformation operations
  within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By ensuring logs are active, organizations
  can monitor data transformations, detect anomalies, and track data lineage. This
  enhances security by providing critical insights into data operations and strengthens
  compliance efforts by maintaining an audit trail of data activities, aiding in meeting
  standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks.
