title: Enforce Least Privilege in Lineage Schema RBAC for Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for lineage
  schemas is crucial to minimizing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of data
  breaches. By ensuring that users have only the permissions necessary for their roles,
  organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with regulatory
  requirements, thereby avoiding costly penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that access permissions to the lineage schema within
  IBM Cloud's data virtualization service adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It evaluates the roles and permissions assigned to users, ensuring they are limited
  to only what is necessary for their specific tasks. By restricting access, this
  rule enhances the overall security posture by preventing unauthorized data exposure
  and potential misuse. Additionally, it supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access controls
  to protect sensitive information.
