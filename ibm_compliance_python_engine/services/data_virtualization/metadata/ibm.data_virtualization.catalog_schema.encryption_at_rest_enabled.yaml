title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for IBM Cloud Data Virtualization Schemas
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for data stored in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  schemas is critical to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and
  breaches. It ensures that data remains secure even if physical media are compromised,
  thereby maintaining trust and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for catalog
  schemas within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. When encryption at rest
  is configured, it safeguards the data by encrypting it on storage media, thereby
  preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality. This practice
  not only enhances the security posture of the organization but also aids in meeting
  various compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, which mandate stringent
  data protection controls.
