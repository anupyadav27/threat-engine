title: Ensure Lineage ML Transform Logs are Enabled in Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Lineage ML Transform Logs is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of data transformations within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service.
  This logging capability supports forensic analysis and compliance with data governance
  policies by capturing detailed records of data lineage and transformation activities.
  Failure to enable these logs may result in undetected data anomalies and hinder
  compliance with regulatory requirements, impacting business integrity and trust.
description: This rule verifies that Lineage ML Transform Logs are enabled for data
  transformations within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By ensuring these
  logs are active, organizations can track and document the flow and transformation
  of data, providing a vital audit trail that enhances security posture and supports
  compliance efforts. Enabling these logs helps organizations meet regulatory obligations,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, by maintaining transparency and accountability in data processing
  operations. Moreover, it aids in identifying unauthorized access or modifications,
  thereby bolstering data integrity and security.
