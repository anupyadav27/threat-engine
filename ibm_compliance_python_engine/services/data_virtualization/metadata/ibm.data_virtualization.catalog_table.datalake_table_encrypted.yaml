title: Enforce Encryption for Datalake Tables in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting datalake tables is crucial to safeguarding sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. As enterprises increasingly rely
  on large-scale data storage, ensuring that data-at-rest is encrypted helps maintain
  data privacy and supports compliance with industry regulations such as GDPR and
  CCPA. Failing to encrypt datalake tables could lead to financial penalties and damage
  to the organization's reputation in the event of a data breach.
description: This rule checks that all datalake tables within the IBM Data Virtualization
  service are encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest involves converting data into
  a secure format while it is stored, ensuring that even if a breach occurs, the data
  remains unreadable without the correct decryption key. Implementing this control
  enhances the overall security posture by protecting sensitive information and helping
  organizations meet various regulatory compliance requirements. This rule ensures
  that encryption standards are consistently applied across all catalog tables, minimizing
  the risk of data exposure.
