rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.lineage_job_role_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage Job Roles in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that roles associated with lineage jobs adhere to the principle
  of least privilege is critical to minimizing security risks. Over-privileged accounts
  can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of sensitive information,
  adversely affecting business operations and compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that roles assigned to lineage jobs in IBM Data Virtualization
  have only the necessary permissions required for their function. By enforcing least
  privilege, the rule reduces the attack surface and risk of malicious activities
  by limiting access rights. This practice aligns with compliance frameworks and standards,
  ensuring that access control policies are consistently applied and monitored. The
  rule checks for excessive permissions and recommends adjustments to adhere to best
  practices in identity and access management.
