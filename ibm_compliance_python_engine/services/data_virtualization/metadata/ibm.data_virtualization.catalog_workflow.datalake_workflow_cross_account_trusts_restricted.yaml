title: Restrict Cross-Account Trusts in Datalake Workflows for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account trusts in datalake workflows is crucial for minimizing
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By limiting these trusts, organizations
  can ensure that sensitive data remains protected within its intended boundaries,
  reducing the risk of exposure and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks for any cross-account trusts established within the
  data virtualization catalog workflows, ensuring they are restricted and appropriately
  managed. By enforcing this restriction, it enhances the security posture by preventing
  unauthorized access to sensitive datasets across different accounts. This practice
  not only safeguards data integrity and confidentiality but also aids in complying
  with data protection regulations by ensuring that access controls are strictly enforced
  and monitored.
