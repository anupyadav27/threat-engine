title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for Data Virtualization Quality Ruleset
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data
  stored within the IBM Cloud data virtualization service. This security measure helps
  protect against unauthorized access and potential data breaches, ensuring compliance
  with industry standards and regulations. Failure to encrypt data at rest can lead
  to severe financial and reputational damage from data exposure incidents.
description: This rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for quality rulesets
  within the IBM Cloud data virtualization service. By implementing encryption at
  rest, all stored data is encrypted using strong cryptographic methods, thereby enhancing
  the security posture of the stored information. This practice not only protects
  sensitive data from unauthorized access but also aids in meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations. Ensuring encryption
  at rest is a fundamental step in maintaining data privacy and integrity across cloud
  environments.
