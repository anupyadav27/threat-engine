title: Restrict Lineage Trigger Event Sources in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Limiting the event sources for lineage triggers within IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and preventing
  unauthorized data access. By restricting these sources, organizations can ensure
  that only approved and monitored data flows contribute to lineage tracking, thereby
  reducing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.
description: This rule enforces the restriction of event sources for lineage triggers
  in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. It checks whether the configured lineage
  trigger event sources are limited to a predefined set of trusted and verified sources.
  By implementing such restrictions, organizations can improve the security of their
  data lineage processes, ensuring that only authorized data movements are tracked
  and recorded. This measure not only enhances data protection but also aligns with
  compliance frameworks requiring strict access controls and data monitoring to safeguard
  sensitive information.
