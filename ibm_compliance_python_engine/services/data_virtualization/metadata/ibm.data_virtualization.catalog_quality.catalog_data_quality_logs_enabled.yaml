title: Enable Logging for Catalog Data Quality in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling catalog data quality logs is essential for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of data interactions within IBM Data Virtualization. It helps in identifying
  data quality issues and unauthorized access attempts, thereby enhancing data integrity
  and security. Ensuring these logs are enabled supports compliance with regulatory
  requirements and internal governance policies, mitigating risks associated with
  data breaches and operational discrepancies.
description: This rule verifies that catalog data quality logging is enabled in the
  IBM Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that logs are consistently captured,
  an organization can monitor and analyze data quality metrics, track changes, and
  detect anomalies. This capability not only supports proactive issue resolution but
  also strengthens the overall security posture by facilitating detailed audits and
  compliance reporting. Implementing robust logging practices aligns with industry
  standards and helps maintain trust with stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment
  to data governance.
