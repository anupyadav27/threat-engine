title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Lineage Workflow in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for the lineage workflow
  in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data against
  unauthorized access. By encrypting data at rest using KMS, organizations enhance
  their data protection strategy and ensure compliance with industry standards and
  regulations, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining customer
  trust.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for the lineage workflow
  within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By enforcing KMS encryption, the
  data is secured using IBM's robust encryption mechanisms, which protect data at
  rest. This measure not only strengthens the security posture of the organization
  but also aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  as encryption is a critical component of data protection mandates. Implementing
  this rule ensures that all sensitive lineage data is encrypted, mitigating potential
  data exposure risks.
