title: Enforce Private Network Access for Data Virtualization Lineage Jobs
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that lineage jobs within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service
  are restricted to private network access is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity. By preventing exposure to public networks, organizations can mitigate
  the risks of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive
  data and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This security rule verifies that all lineage jobs in the IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization service are configured to operate exclusively over private networks.
  By enforcing private network access, the rule enhances security by reducing the
  attack surface and preventing unauthorized external access. Adhering to this rule
  aligns with best practices for network security, ensuring compliance with standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures.
