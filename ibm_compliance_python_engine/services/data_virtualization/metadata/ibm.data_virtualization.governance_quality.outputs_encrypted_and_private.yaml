rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.governance_quality.outputs_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure Encryption and Privacy of Data Virtualization Outputs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that data virtualization outputs are encrypted and kept private
  is critical for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and data
  breaches. This rule helps mitigate the risk of data exposure, which can lead to
  compliance violations, financial penalties, and damage to an organization's reputation.
description: This rule verifies that all outputs generated through IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service are encrypted and maintained in a private state. By enforcing
  encryption at rest, it ensures that data is safeguarded against unauthorized access
  and potential breaches. This practice not only enhances the overall security posture
  but also aids in meeting regulatory requirements and industry standards for data
  protection and privacy, thereby ensuring that organizational data governance policies
  are consistently applied.
