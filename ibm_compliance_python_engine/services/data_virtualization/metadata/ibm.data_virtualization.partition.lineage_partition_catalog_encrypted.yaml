title: Ensure Encryption of Lineage Partition Catalog in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the Lineage Partition Catalog in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  ensures that sensitive data remains protected from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This encryption is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality,
  integrity, and compliance with industry standards and regulations, thereby safeguarding
  business operations and customer trust.
description: This security rule checks whether the Lineage Partition Catalog within
  the Data Virtualization service is encrypted at rest. Encryption of this catalog
  is vital as it contains metadata and lineage information crucial for data governance
  and auditing purposes. By ensuring this encryption, organizations can enhance their
  security posture, mitigate risks of unauthorized data exposure, and comply with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. This practice not only improves
  overall data security but also supports regulatory compliance and audit readiness.
