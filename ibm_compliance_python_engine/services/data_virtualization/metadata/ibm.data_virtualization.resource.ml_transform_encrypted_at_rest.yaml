title: Ensure ML Transform Data is Encrypted at Rest in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting ML Transform data at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This security measure
  helps ensure compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  and mitigates the risk of data exposure, which can lead to financial penalties and
  damage to the organization's reputation.
description: This rule verifies that machine learning transform data within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service is encrypted at rest. The encryption process involves
  converting data into a secure format that is unreadable without the appropriate
  decryption key, thereby safeguarding it against unauthorized access. Implementing
  encryption at rest enhances data security by protecting stored information even
  if the storage medium is compromised. Adhering to this rule not only strengthens
  the organization's security posture but also aligns with industry standards and
  compliance frameworks, thereby reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties.
