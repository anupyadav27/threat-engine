title: Ensure Least Privilege for Catalog Dev Endpoint Roles in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for catalog development endpoint
  roles is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  By granting only necessary permissions, organizations can reduce the potential attack
  surface, thereby mitigating the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with
  security policies and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule assesses the permissions assigned to roles associated with
  catalog development endpoints within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service.
  It ensures that roles are configured with the minimum permissions necessary to perform
  their functions, aligning with the least privilege principle. By enforcing this
  rule, organizations can improve their security posture by restricting access to
  critical resources and reducing the likelihood of privilege escalation attacks.
  Furthermore, adherence to this rule aids in maintaining compliance with industry
  standards and regulatory frameworks, enhancing overall data protection.
