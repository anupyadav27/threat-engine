rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog.datalake_catalog_metaencryption_enabled
title: Ensure Datalake Catalog Metaencryption is Enabled for Data Protection
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling metaencryption for the Datalake Catalog on IBM Cloud ensures that
  metadata associated with data virtualization resources is encrypted at rest. This
  practice is critical to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. By securing metadata, organizations can mitigate the risk
  of exposing critical business insights and comply with industry regulations on data
  protection.
description: This rule verifies whether metaencryption is enabled for the Datalake
  Catalog within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. Metaencryption ensures
  that metadata, which often contains critical information about data structures and
  access patterns, is encrypted when stored. Enabling this feature enhances the overall
  security posture by safeguarding against unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive
  metadata. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to data protection standards
  and enhances the organization's ability to meet regulatory requirements related
  to data encryption at rest.
