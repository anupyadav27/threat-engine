title: Ensure Private and Encrypted Datalake Output in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that the datalake quality output location is private and encrypted
  is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. This practice not only mitigates the risk of data exposure but also supports
  compliance with industry regulations and standards, thereby protecting the organization's
  reputation and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that the output location for datalake quality within
  the IBM Data Virtualization service is both private and encrypted. By enforcing
  encryption at rest, the rule ensures that any data stored in the output location
  is protected against unauthorized access and tampering. Furthermore, making the
  location private restricts access to authorized users only, reducing the risk of
  data leakage. Implementing this rule enhances the overall security posture by aligning
  with best practices in data protection and supports compliance with data privacy
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
