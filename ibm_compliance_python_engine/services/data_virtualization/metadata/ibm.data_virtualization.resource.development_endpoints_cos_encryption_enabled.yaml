title: Ensure COS Encryption Enabled for Development Endpoints in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for Cloud Object Storage (COS) within development endpoints
  is critical to safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and breaches.
  Encryption at rest protects data stored in the cloud, ensuring compliance with regulatory
  standards and mitigating the risk of data exposure in the event of a security incident.
  Failing to encrypt data could lead to severe business ramifications, including financial
  penalties and loss of customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for data stored in IBM
  Cloud Object Storage (COS) used by development endpoints in the Data Virtualization
  service. By ensuring encryption at rest, the rule enhances data confidentiality
  and integrity, reducing the risk of unauthorized data access. Implementing this
  control aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements, supporting
  organizations in achieving compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. The rule checks for encryption settings on storage resources and prompts
  corrective actions if encryption is not configured, thereby bolstering the overall
  security posture of the cloud environment.
