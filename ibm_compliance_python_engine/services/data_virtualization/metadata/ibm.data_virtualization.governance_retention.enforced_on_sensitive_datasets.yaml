title: Enforce Governance Retention on Sensitive Datasets in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring governance retention policies are enforced on sensitive datasets
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulatory standards.
  By applying these controls, organizations can protect sensitive information from
  unauthorized access and potential breaches, minimizing the risk of data loss and
  financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that governance retention policies are applied to
  sensitive datasets within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. It checks for
  the existence and enforcement of data retention rules that require sensitive data
  to be encrypted at rest. Implementing these measures enhances data security by ensuring
  that sensitive datasets are stored securely and in compliance with relevant data
  protection regulations, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized data access and
  ensuring data privacy.
