title: Ensure Encryption of ETL Jobs Monitoring Logs in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting ETL jobs monitoring logs is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access and potential breaches. This measure ensures compliance
  with data protection regulations and mitigates the risk of data exposure, thereby
  maintaining organizational trust and avoiding financial penalties associated with
  non-compliance.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for monitoring logs generated
  by ETL jobs in IBM Data Virtualization. By encrypting these logs, organizations
  can protect sensitive information contained within, such as data processing activities
  and potential anomalies. This improves overall security posture by ensuring that
  any data at rest is inaccessible to unauthorized users, aligning with industry standards
  for data protection and privacy. Enforcing this encryption aids in compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA by demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding
  personal data.
