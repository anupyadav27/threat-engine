title: Enforce Private Network Access for Datalake ML Transform Operations
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Limiting network access to private channels for Datalake ML Transform operations
  is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. This rule mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches by ensuring that only trusted, internal networks
  can interact with these processes. Adhering to this rule helps maintain business
  integrity and compliance with industry standards.
description: This security rule checks that all Datalake ML Transform operations within
  the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service are configured to accept network traffic
  exclusively from private IP addresses. By enforcing private network access, the
  rule enhances the overall security posture by reducing the attack surface and restricting
  exposure to external threats. Implementing this control assists in achieving compliance
  with network access control policies and supports adherence to regulatory mandates
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data protection measures.
