title: Ensure Lineage Quality Logs Are Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling lineage quality logs in IBM Cloud's data virtualization service
  is crucial for maintaining a clear audit trail of data transformations and movements.
  This practice enhances the ability to identify and address data quality issues promptly,
  thereby minimizing potential risks related to data integrity and compliance breaches.
  Moreover, having comprehensive logging supports forensic investigations and accountability,
  which are vital for businesses to demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that lineage quality logs are enabled within the catalog
  quality component of IBM Cloud's data virtualization service. By ensuring that these
  logs are active, organizations can monitor and review the lineage of their data
  processes, providing insights into data quality and transformation activities. This
  improves security by facilitating the detection of unauthorized data alterations
  and supports compliance by maintaining detailed records that can be audited to meet
  regulatory requirements. Effective logging is a best practice for data governance,
  enabling proactive monitoring and response to potential data quality issues.
