title: Enforce Version Immutability for Data Virtualization Catalog Schemas
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing version immutability on catalog schemas within IBM's Data Virtualization
  service ensures that data representations remain consistent and tamper-proof over
  time. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity, auditability, and compliance,
  especially in environments where data changes need to be meticulously tracked. Without
  version immutability, unauthorized or accidental changes could compromise data reliability
  and lead to significant business risks, including regulatory non-compliance and
  data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether version immutability is enforced for catalog
  schemas within the Data Virtualization service on IBM Cloud. By enabling immutability,
  each version of a catalog schema is locked upon creation, preventing unauthorized
  alterations. This enhances security by ensuring data consistency and integrity,
  and supports compliance with data protection regulations by providing a clear audit
  trail. Implementing version immutability is a critical step in safeguarding sensitive
  data and ensuring that only authorized changes occur in a controlled manner.
