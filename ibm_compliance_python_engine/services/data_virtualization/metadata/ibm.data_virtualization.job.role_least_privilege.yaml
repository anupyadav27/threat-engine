title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Job Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege within data virtualization
  job roles is crucial to minimize potential security risks and unauthorized data
  access. By ensuring that roles are only granted the minimum permissions necessary,
  organizations can significantly reduce the attack surface and prevent the misuse
  of sensitive data, thereby protecting business assets and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that roles assigned to data virtualization jobs do
  not exceed the necessary permissions required for their specific functions. It ensures
  that any job-related access is strictly controlled and limited, thereby enhancing
  the overall security posture. By adhering to this principle, organizations align
  with best practices for identity and access management, reducing the risk of privilege
  escalation and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
