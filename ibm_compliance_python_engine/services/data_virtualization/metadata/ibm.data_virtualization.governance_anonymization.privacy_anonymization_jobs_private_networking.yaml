title: Ensure Privacy Anonymization Jobs Use Private Networking
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing private networking for privacy anonymization jobs is vital to
  safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It enhances
  the security posture by limiting exposure to public networks, ensuring that data
  remains within a controlled environment, thereby reducing the risk of data exfiltration
  and aligning with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that privacy anonymization jobs within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service are configured to utilize private networking. By ensuring
  these jobs run over private networks, organizations can significantly reduce the
  attack surface and protect sensitive data during processing. This setup not only
  bolsters data security but also aids in achieving compliance with various data protection
  and privacy standards by ensuring encryption at rest and secure data handling practices.
