title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in IBM Data Virtualization Lineage Catalog
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of the lineage catalog ensures that sensitive
  data and metadata remain within the intended organizational boundaries, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access. This limitation helps maintain data integrity and
  confidentiality, which are crucial for compliance with data protection regulations
  and preventing potential data breaches.
description: This rule ensures that cross-account sharing of lineage data within the
  IBM Data Virtualization service is restricted. By auditing and controlling the sharing
  capabilities of the lineage catalog, organizations can prevent unauthorized access
  and sharing of metadata across different accounts. Implementing this restriction
  enhances the security posture by ensuring that only authorized users within the
  same account can access and manipulate the lineage data, thus aligning with best
  practices for data governance, security, and compliance.
