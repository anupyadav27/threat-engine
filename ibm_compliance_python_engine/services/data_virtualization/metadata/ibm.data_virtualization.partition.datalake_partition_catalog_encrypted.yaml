title: Ensure Encryption of Datalake Partition Catalog in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the Datalake Partition Catalog is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that data remains
  protected even if physical or logical controls are bypassed, thus maintaining customer
  trust and complying with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the Datalake Partition Catalog within the IBM
  Cloud Data Virtualization service is encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest is a
  critical security measure that protects data by encoding it while it is stored,
  ensuring that it is unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys. Implementing
  this encryption enhances data security, mitigates risks associated with data breaches,
  and assists organizations in achieving compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and more. By enforcing encryption, businesses can minimize the risk of data exposure
  and ensure the privacy and integrity of their datasets.
