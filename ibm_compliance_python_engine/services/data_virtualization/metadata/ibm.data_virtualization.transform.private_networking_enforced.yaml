title: Enforce Private Networking for IBM Data Virtualization Transform
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that data transformations within IBM Data Virtualization occur
  over private networks significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and
  data breaches. This requirement helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality,
  which is crucial for compliance with industry standards and regulatory mandates.
  By enforcing private networking, organizations can better protect sensitive data
  and maintain customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that the IBM Data Virtualization service's
  transformation processes are configured to use private networking. The check ensures
  that data is transmitted securely within a controlled environment, limiting exposure
  to the public internet and minimizing vulnerabilities to attacks. Implementing private
  networking improves security by enforcing network-level access controls, reducing
  the attack surface, and ensuring adherence to compliance frameworks that require
  secure data handling practices. By mandating private networking, organizations can
  achieve enhanced data protection and align with best practices for network security
  and connectivity.
