title: Enforce Least Privilege on Datalake Trigger Targets in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for datalake trigger targets
  is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted, organizations can reduce
  the attack surface and enhance the security posture of their data assets, thereby
  protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule audits datalake trigger configurations in IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service to ensure they adhere to the least privilege principle. It
  checks whether permissions assigned to datalake trigger targets are limited to those
  strictly necessary for the intended operations. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can prevent excessive privileges that could be exploited by malicious actors or
  result in accidental data exposure. Adhering to this rule supports compliance with
  security standards and best practices, such as ISO 27001 and GDPR, by ensuring that
  access controls are appropriately scoped and managed.
