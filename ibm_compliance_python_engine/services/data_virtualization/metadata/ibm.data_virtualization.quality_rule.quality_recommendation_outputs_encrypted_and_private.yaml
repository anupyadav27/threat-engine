title: Ensure Encryption and Privacy of Quality Recommendation Outputs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data is crucial for maintaining
  customer trust and meeting regulatory requirements. By encrypting quality recommendation
  outputs, businesses can guard against unauthorized access and data breaches, which
  can lead to financial loss and reputational damage. Implementing encryption at rest
  ensures that sensitive data remains secure even if the underlying storage is compromised.
description: This rule verifies that quality recommendation outputs within the Data
  Virtualization service are encrypted and kept private. It checks that all outputs
  are encrypted using strong encryption algorithms while stored, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure. This practice not only strengthens
  data protection but also aids in compliance with various data protection regulations,
  such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate robust data security measures. By adhering
  to this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture and demonstrate a
  commitment to data privacy.
