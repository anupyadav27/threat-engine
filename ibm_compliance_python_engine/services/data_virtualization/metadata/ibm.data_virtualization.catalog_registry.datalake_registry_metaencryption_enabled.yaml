rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_registry.datalake_registry_metaencryption_enabled
title: Ensure Metaencryption is Enabled for Datalake Registry in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling metaencryption for the datalake registry is crucial for safeguarding
  sensitive metadata against unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures
  that data is protected even if physical storage media is compromised, thereby maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of the data assets. This security measure aligns
  with regulatory compliance requirements and helps in protecting the organization's
  reputation and avoiding potential financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that metaencryption is enabled for the datalake registry
  within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By encrypting metadata at rest,
  it adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that any sensitive data descriptors
  are not exposed to malicious entities. Implementing metaencryption enhances the
  overall security posture by preventing unauthorized access to underlying data structures
  and supports compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR and CCPA. This
  check is essential for maintaining a high-security standard in cloud data management
  practices.
