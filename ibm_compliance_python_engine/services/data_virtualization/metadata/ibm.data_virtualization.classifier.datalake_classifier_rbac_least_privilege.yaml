title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Classifier RBAC in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring least privilege access in data virtualization services is critical
  to minimizing the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
  By restricting permissions to only what users need to perform their job functions,
  organizations can protect sensitive data from misuse and comply with regulatory
  requirements, reducing both security incidents and compliance violations.
description: This rule checks whether Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings for
  the datalake classifier in IBM Cloud's data virtualization service are configured
  to enforce the principle of least privilege. It evaluates the permissions granted
  to each role associated with the classifier, ensuring that users and services have
  only the necessary access to perform their required tasks. Implementing this rule
  enhances security by restricting excessive permissions, thereby reducing the attack
  surface and aligning with compliance frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA that demand
  strict access controls.
