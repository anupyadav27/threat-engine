title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in Data Virtualization Catalogs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing in data virtualization catalogs is crucial
  to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. By limiting access strictly
  to necessary accounts, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches and
  ensure compliance with privacy regulations. This practice also helps maintain data
  integrity and confidentiality, bolstering business trust and reducing potential
  legal and financial repercussions.
description: This security rule ensures that data virtualization catalogs within IBM
  Cloud are not shared across different accounts unless explicitly required and authorized.
  It checks configurations for any unauthorized cross-account sharing permissions
  in the catalog registry. By enforcing this restriction, the rule enhances the security
  of data at rest by preventing unauthorized data access, thereby supporting compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this rule
  helps maintain a robust security posture by reducing the attack surface and protecting
  sensitive data against unauthorized exposure.
