title: Ensuring Defined Governance Retention Policies for Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Establishing defined governance retention policies is crucial for maintaining
  data protection and compliance with regulatory requirements. Without clear policies,
  data may be retained longer than necessary, increasing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Proper policies ensure that data is securely
  managed and disposed of according to legal and business standards, mitigating risks
  associated with data sprawl.
description: This rule checks for the existence and enforcement of governance retention
  policies within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. It ensures that data
  stored in virtualized environments has defined retention schedules, which specify
  how long data should be retained before it is encrypted at rest or securely deleted.
  Implementing these policies helps organizations achieve compliance with data protection
  regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, by controlling data lifecycle management and
  minimizing exposure to data-related risks. This practice not only enhances security
  posture but also contributes to operational efficiency by reducing unnecessary data
  storage costs.
