title: Ensure Privacy Consent Store is Encrypted at Rest in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting privacy consent data at rest is critical to safeguarding sensitive
  information against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It ensures
  that even if physical storage media are compromised, the encrypted data remains
  protected, maintaining customer trust and compliance with global data protection
  regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all privacy consent data within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service is encrypted when stored. By implementing encryption
  at rest, the rule strengthens data protection by ensuring that the consent information
  is not accessible to unauthorized users. Compliance with this rule helps organizations
  align with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and ensuring adherence to data privacy laws.
