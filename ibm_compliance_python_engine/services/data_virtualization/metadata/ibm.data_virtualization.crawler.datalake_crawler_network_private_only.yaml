rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.crawler.datalake_crawler_network_private_only
title: Enforce Private Network Access for Datalake Crawlers
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that datalake crawlers operate solely within private networks
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. By restricting network
  access, organizations can safeguard sensitive data, maintain compliance with industry
  regulations, and protect against potential attack vectors that exploit public network
  vulnerabilities.
description: This rule mandates that data virtualization crawlers are restricted to
  private network environments, preventing any exposure to public internet traffic.
  By enforcing this control, it ensures that crawlers only interact with internal
  resources, thereby reducing the surface area for potential threats. Implementing
  private network-only access for crawlers enhances security by preventing unauthorized
  data exfiltration and increasing compliance adherence to standards like GDPR and
  HIPAA, which require stringent data protection measures.
