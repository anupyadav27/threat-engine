title: Secure Lineage Connection Credentials in IBM Cloud Secrets Manager
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Protecting connection credentials by storing them in IBM Cloud Secrets
  Manager mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By
  ensuring sensitive credentials are securely managed, organizations can maintain
  data integrity and comply with regulatory requirements, thus avoiding potential
  financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all lineage connection credentials within IBM's
  Data Virtualization service are stored in the IBM Cloud Secrets Manager. By centralizing
  credential storage and management, this practice enhances data security by controlling
  access to sensitive information and automating credential rotations. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, by providing audit trails and secure access controls.
