title: Ensure Encryption for Catalog Dev Endpoints in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and breaches. Without encryption, data can be exposed to
  potential threats, leading to data loss, compliance violations, and reputational
  damage. Ensuring that the Catalog Dev Endpoint in IBM Data Virtualization is encrypted
  mitigates these risks by safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of data.
description: This security rule checks whether the Catalog Dev Endpoint in IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service is configured with encryption at rest. By enforcing
  encryption, it ensures that all sensitive data stored within this endpoint is protected
  using strong cryptographic algorithms. This not only fortifies the security posture
  of the data but also aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  for data protection and privacy. Compliance with this rule helps organizations meet
  standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, reducing the risk of data breaches and
  enhancing customer trust.
