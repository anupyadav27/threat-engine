rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.transform.datalake_ml_transform_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Datalake ML Transform Logs are Enabled for Audit Compliance
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logs for Datalake ML transformations is critical for maintaining
  an audit trail and ensuring traceability of data processing activities. This practice
  not only aids in detecting unauthorized access or anomalies but also supports compliance
  with data protection regulations and internal governance policies. Failure to log
  these activities could lead to undetected security breaches and non-compliance penalties.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Datalake ML transform
  operations within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that these
  logs are active, organizations can monitor and review data processing activities,
  which enhances security posture by enabling detailed audit trails. This capability
  is crucial for compliance with industry standards and regulations that require comprehensive
  logging of data handling processes. Enabling transform logs also provides insights
  into data usage patterns and helps in performing forensic analysis in case of security
  incidents.
