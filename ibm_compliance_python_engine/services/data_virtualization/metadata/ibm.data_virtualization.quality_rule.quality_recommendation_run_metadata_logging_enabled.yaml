title: Ensure Metadata Logging is Enabled for Quality Recommendation Runs
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling metadata logging for quality recommendation runs in IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability.
  This practice allows for tracking the lineage and execution details of recommendation
  processes, aiding in identifying and rectifying issues promptly. Additionally, it
  supports compliance with regulatory requirements by providing an audit trail of
  data processing activities.
description: This security rule verifies that metadata logging is enabled for quality
  recommendation runs within the Data Virtualization service. By capturing detailed
  logs of recommendation executions, organizations can enhance their monitoring and
  alerting capabilities, enabling timely identification of anomalies or unauthorized
  access attempts. This logging process ensures that all relevant actions are recorded,
  contributing to a robust audit trail that assists in both internal security assessments
  and external compliance audits. Enabling this feature aligns with best practices
  in data governance and operational transparency.
