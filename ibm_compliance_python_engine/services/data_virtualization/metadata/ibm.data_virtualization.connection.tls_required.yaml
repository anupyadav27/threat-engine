rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.connection.tls_required
title: Enforce TLS for Data Virtualization Connections
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that all data virtualization connections utilize TLS is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data in transit. TLS encryption helps prevent unauthorized
  access and interception of data, safeguarding business-critical information and
  maintaining trust with clients and stakeholders.
description: This rule mandates the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all
  connections within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By enforcing TLS, data transmitted
  between services and clients is encrypted, significantly reducing the risk of data
  breaches and ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Implementing TLS aligns with
  industry best practices and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  necessitate robust encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
