rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.endpoint.catalog_dev_endpoint_no_public_access
title: Secure Catalog Dev Endpoints Against Public Access
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting public access to catalog development endpoints is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized users from exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive
  data. Uncontrolled public exposure of these endpoints can lead to data breaches,
  resulting in financial loss and reputational damage to the organization.
description: This rule checks the network configuration of catalog development endpoints
  within IBM Cloud's data virtualization service to ensure they are not publicly accessible.
  By enforcing strict network access controls, this rule helps to minimize attack
  vectors and limit exposure to potential threats. Implementing such restrictions
  is a fundamental aspect of maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
