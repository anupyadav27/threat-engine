title: Enforce Private Networking for Data Virtualization Crawlers
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for crawlers in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. By limiting network exposure, organizations can significantly reduce the
  risk of data leaks and maintain integrity, which is crucial for meeting regulatory
  compliance and protecting business reputation.
description: This rule verifies that crawlers within the Data Virtualization service
  are configured to operate solely within private networks. By enabling private networking,
  the exposure of data and network traffic to public internet threats is minimized,
  thus enhancing the overall security posture. This practice aligns with best practices
  for network access control, ensuring that data processing activities remain within
  secure boundaries. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to data protection
  regulations by safeguarding data in transit and at rest, offering an additional
  layer of security by preventing unauthorized access.
