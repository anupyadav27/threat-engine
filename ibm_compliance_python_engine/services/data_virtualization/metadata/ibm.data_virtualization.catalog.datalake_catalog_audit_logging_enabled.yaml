title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization Catalog
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for the Datalake Catalog in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. It ensures that all access
  and modifications to the catalog are recorded, providing a comprehensive trail for
  forensic analysis and compliance audits. This logging capability not only helps
  in detecting unauthorized access or anomalies but also supports legal and regulatory
  compliance requirements by providing evidence of data governance practices.
description: This security rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for the Datalake
  Catalog in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization. Audit logging captures and records all
  user activities and system events related to the catalog, such as data access, modifications,
  and configuration changes. Enabling this feature enhances security by allowing administrators
  to monitor and investigate suspicious activities, thus mitigating the risk of data
  breaches. Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and others by ensuring accountability and traceability of data usage within the
  organization.
