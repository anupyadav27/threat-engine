title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in Lineage Registry for Data Protection
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing in the Lineage Registry is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By limiting data lineage visibility
  to specific accounts, businesses can mitigate the risks of data leaks and unauthorized
  data manipulation, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and preserving
  customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that the Lineage Registry in IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service does not permit cross-account data sharing unless explicitly
  authorized. By enforcing strict access controls, this rule ensures that data lineage
  information is only visible to authorized users within the same account, reducing
  the attack surface and enhancing data protection. Compliance with this rule helps
  organizations meet industry standards for data privacy and protection, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, thereby strengthening their overall security posture.
