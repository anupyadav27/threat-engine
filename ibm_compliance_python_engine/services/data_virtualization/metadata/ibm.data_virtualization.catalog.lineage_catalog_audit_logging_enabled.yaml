title: Ensure Lineage Catalog Audit Logging is Enabled in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for the Lineage Catalog in IBM Data Virtualization
  is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability in data operations. It
  helps organizations detect unauthorized access or changes to the data lineage, which
  can prevent data breaches and ensure data integrity. This practice not only strengthens
  security but also supports compliance with industry regulations by providing a traceable
  record of all data access and modifications.
description: This security rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for the Lineage
  Catalog within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that all actions
  related to data lineage are logged, organizations can monitor and review data access
  activities effectively. This enhances security by quickly identifying and responding
  to suspicious activities, and supports compliance efforts by maintaining comprehensive
  audit trails. Enabling such logging is a best practice for protecting sensitive
  data and ensuring accountability in data management processes.
