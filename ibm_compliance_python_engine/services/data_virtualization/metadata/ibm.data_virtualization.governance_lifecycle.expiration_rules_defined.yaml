title: Ensure Expiration Rules Are Defined for Data Virtualization Governance
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Defining expiration rules for data governance within IBM Cloud's data virtualization
  service is crucial for maintaining data privacy and protection. It helps minimize
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by ensuring that sensitive data
  does not persist beyond its useful life. This practice aligns with data governance
  policies and regulatory requirements, reducing potential legal liabilities and enhancing
  organizational reputation.
description: This rule checks for the presence of defined expiration rules within
  the data virtualization service's governance lifecycle. By implementing these rules,
  organizations can automate the lifecycle management of their data, ensuring that
  it is securely deleted or archived when it is no longer needed. This not only strengthens
  data protection by reducing the attack surface but also aids in compliance with
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, which require strict data retention
  and deletion protocols.
