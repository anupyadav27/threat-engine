title: Ensure Datalake Lineage Capture is Enabled for Enhanced Data Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Datalake Lineage Capture is crucial for maintaining visibility
  and control over data flows within your organization. By capturing lineage information,
  businesses can effectively track data transformations, understand data provenance,
  and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations. This capability also aids in
  identifying potential data breaches and mitigating their impact, thus safeguarding
  sensitive information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies whether the lineage capture feature is enabled for
  datalakes within the IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. Enabling this feature
  allows organizations to automatically capture and maintain comprehensive records
  of data transformations and movements across different data sources and destinations.
  This not only enhances data governance by providing a transparent view of data handling
  but also supports compliance with regulatory frameworks that require data traceability
  and accountability. By ensuring lineage capture is active, organizations can more
  readily audit data interactions and maintain robust security postures.
