title: Ensuring Versioning is Enabled for Governance Lifecycle in Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling versioning in data governance processes is essential for maintaining
  data integrity and providing traceability. It ensures that any changes to governance
  policies or data handling procedures can be tracked and audited, reducing the risk
  of data breaches or non-compliance with regulatory standards. This capability enhances
  the auditability and resilience of data management practices, ultimately preserving
  business continuity and reputation.
description: This rule checks whether versioning is enabled for governance lifecycle
  management in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service where supported. By ensuring
  versioning is activated, organizations can maintain detailed records of changes
  to governance policies and configurations. This not only enhances security by providing
  a historical record of alterations but also supports compliance efforts by enabling
  easier audits and reviews. Implementing versioning aids in quickly identifying and
  rectifying unauthorized changes, thus strengthening data security and governance.
