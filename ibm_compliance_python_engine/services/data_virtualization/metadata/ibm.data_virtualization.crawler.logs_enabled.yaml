rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.crawler.logs_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization Crawlers
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logs for data virtualization crawlers is crucial for maintaining
  transparency and accountability in data operations. It helps organizations detect
  unauthorized access attempts and operational anomalies, thus safeguarding sensitive
  information and supporting compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for crawlers in the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service. Logging provides a detailed trail of crawler activities,
  including data access and processing events, which is vital for auditing and forensic
  investigations. By ensuring logs are enabled, organizations can improve their security
  posture by monitoring for suspicious activities and ensuring compliance with standards
  like GDPR and HIPAA that require robust logging practices.
