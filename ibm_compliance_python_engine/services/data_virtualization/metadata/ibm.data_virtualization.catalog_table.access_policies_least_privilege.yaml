title: Enforce Least Privilege on Data Virtualization Catalog Table Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access policies for catalog tables in IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure or modification. By restricting access to only those individuals and
  processes that absolutely need it, organizations can significantly reduce the potential
  attack surface, thereby enhancing data security and protecting sensitive information
  from breaches.
description: This rule ensures that access policies for catalog tables within the
  IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service are configured according to the principle
  of least privilege. The rule checks that permissions are granted only to specific
  users or groups who require access for their roles, thereby preventing excessive
  permissions that could lead to data leaks or unauthorized data manipulation. By
  adhering to this rule, organizations not only strengthen their security posture
  but also ensure compliance with relevant regulatory frameworks and industry standards
  that mandate strict access controls.
