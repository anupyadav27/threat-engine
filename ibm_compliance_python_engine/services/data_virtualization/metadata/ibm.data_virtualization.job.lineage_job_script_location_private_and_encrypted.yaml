rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.lineage_job_script_location_private_and_encrypted
title: Ensure Lineage Job Scripts are Private and Encrypted in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Securing the location of lineage job scripts is vital to protecting sensitive
  data and intellectual property from unauthorized access and breaches. By ensuring
  these scripts are stored in a private and encrypted manner, organizations can mitigate
  the risks associated with data leaks and comply with data protection regulations,
  thereby maintaining customer trust and avoiding potential legal ramifications.
description: This rule checks that all lineage job scripts within the IBM Data Virtualization
  service are stored in locations that are both private and encrypted. By enforcing
  encryption at rest, the rule ensures that sensitive information within the scripts
  is protected from unauthorized access, even if storage devices are compromised.
  Additionally, restricting access to these scripts to authorized personnel only helps
  in maintaining data privacy and integrity, aligning with industry standards and
  regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
