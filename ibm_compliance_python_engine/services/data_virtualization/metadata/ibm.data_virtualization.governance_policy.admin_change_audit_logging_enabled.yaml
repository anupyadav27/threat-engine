title: Ensure Admin Change Audit Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for administrative changes in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service is crucial for tracking modifications that could affect data integrity and
  security. It provides transparency and accountability, allowing organizations to
  detect unauthorized access or changes swiftly, which is essential for maintaining
  trust and compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging for administrative changes is
  enabled within the governance policies of the Data Virtualization service. By activating
  this feature, organizations can capture detailed logs of administrative actions,
  including who made changes and when they occurred. This aids in forensic analysis,
  ensuring that any unauthorized modifications can be promptly identified and addressed.
  Moreover, maintaining comprehensive audit logs supports compliance with various
  industry regulations and standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by demonstrating a commitment
  to rigorous data governance and security practices.
