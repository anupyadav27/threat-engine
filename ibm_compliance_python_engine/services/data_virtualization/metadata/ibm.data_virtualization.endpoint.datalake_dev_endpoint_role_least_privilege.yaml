title: Enforce Least Privilege on Datalake Dev Endpoint Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that the Datalake Dev Endpoint roles operate on a least privilege
  basis is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. By limiting permissions to only what is necessary for development purposes,
  organizations can reduce their attack surface and prevent misuse of sensitive data,
  thereby aligning with best practices in identity and access management.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions assigned to roles associated with
  the Datalake development endpoints to ensure they adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. It checks that roles are configured with only the necessary permissions
  required for their intended tasks, minimizing excessive privileges that could lead
  to security vulnerabilities. Implementing this rule enhances security by reducing
  the likelihood of privilege escalation attacks and supports compliance with data
  protection regulations by ensuring that access controls are appropriately restrictive.
