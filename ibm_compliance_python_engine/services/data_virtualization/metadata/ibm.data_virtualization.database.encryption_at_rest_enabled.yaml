title: Enforce Encryption at Rest for IBM Data Virtualization Databases
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for databases within IBM's Data Virtualization
  service is crucial for protecting sensitive data against unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. This security measure ensures that data remains confidential
  and secure, even if physical security measures are compromised. Implementing encryption
  at rest helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards,
  reducing the risk of financial penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for databases managed
  by IBM Data Virtualization, ensuring that all stored data is automatically encrypted
  using industry-standard encryption algorithms. By enforcing encryption at rest,
  this rule safeguards data integrity and confidentiality, preventing unauthorized
  access to sensitive information. Compliance with this rule not only enhances data
  protection but also aligns with regulatory mandates such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others,
  demonstrating a commitment to data privacy and security.
