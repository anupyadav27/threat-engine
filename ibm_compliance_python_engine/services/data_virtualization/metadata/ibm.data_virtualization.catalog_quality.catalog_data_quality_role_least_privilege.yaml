title: Enforce Least Privilege for Catalog Data Quality Roles in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for catalog data quality
  roles helps to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By restricting roles to only the necessary permissions, organizations can better
  protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, thereby
  reducing operational risks and potential financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that roles assigned to users within the catalog data
  quality function of IBM Data Virtualization adhere to the least privilege principle.
  It checks that the access permissions granted are strictly necessary for the user's
  duties and do not exceed what is required for their role. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can enhance their security posture by reducing the attack surface
  and limiting the potential impact of compromised credentials. Additionally, it assists
  in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations by ensuring that
  access controls are appropriately implemented and maintained.
