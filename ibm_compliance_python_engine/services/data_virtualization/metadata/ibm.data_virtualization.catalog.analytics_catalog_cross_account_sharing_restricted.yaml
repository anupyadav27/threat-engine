rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog.analytics_catalog_cross_account_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in Analytics Catalog for Security
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing in the Analytics Catalog is crucial to
  prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By limiting how data is shared across
  accounts, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches and ensure that data
  access complies with internal policies and regulatory requirements. This enhances
  trust and maintains the integrity of data within the enterprise.
description: This rule ensures that cross-account sharing of resources within the
  Analytics Catalog is restricted. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of data leaks and
  unauthorized data manipulation. It also aids in maintaining comprehensive audit
  logs, which are essential for demonstrating compliance with industry standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA. The rule promotes a robust security posture by ensuring that
  only authorized users within the same account can access sensitive analytics data.
