title: Ensure Lineage Trigger Logs are Enabled in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling lineage trigger logs in IBM Data Virtualization is crucial for
  maintaining a robust audit trail of data transformations and access. This logging
  practice enhances the traceability of data lineage activities, which is vital for
  forensic investigations and compliance with data governance policies. Failure to
  enable such logs can lead to undetected unauthorized data access or modifications,
  potentially resulting in data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This security rule verifies that lineage trigger logs are enabled for
  catalog triggers within IBM Data Virtualization. By ensuring that these logs are
  active, organizations can monitor and review data lineage activities, including
  data transformations and access patterns. This capability is essential for detecting
  and responding to suspicious activities promptly and maintaining a detailed historical
  record for compliance purposes. Enabling lineage trigger logs not only strengthens
  the security posture but also supports adherence to industry regulations and standards
  by providing necessary audit trails.
