rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.datalake_job_logs_and_metrics_enabled
title: Ensure Datalake Job Logs and Metrics Are Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logs and metrics for datalake jobs is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into job execution and performance. This practice aids in detecting anomalies
  or unauthorized access attempts, which can help prevent data breaches. Effective
  logging ensures compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements,
  avoiding potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks whether logging and metrics are enabled for datalake
  jobs within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that these logs
  and metrics are active, organizations can monitor job activities, providing an audit
  trail that is vital for forensic analysis in case of security incidents. This capability
  not only strengthens the security posture by enabling proactive threat detection
  but also supports compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA by maintaining
  detailed records of data access and processing.
