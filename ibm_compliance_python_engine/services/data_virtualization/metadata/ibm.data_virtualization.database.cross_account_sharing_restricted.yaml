title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing for Data Virtualization Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of databases in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. By limiting data sharing
  to within a single account, organizations can enhance data security and ensure compliance
  with privacy regulations, minimizing the risk of data leakage and potential financial
  repercussions.
description: This rule assesses whether cross-account sharing is restricted for databases
  in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. It verifies that database resources
  are not accessible by users or services outside the designated account, thereby
  reducing the attack surface for unauthorized access. Implementing this restriction
  helps protect sensitive data by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized
  users within the same account can access it. Compliance with this rule supports
  adherence to data protection standards and privacy regulations by maintaining data
  confidentiality and integrity.
