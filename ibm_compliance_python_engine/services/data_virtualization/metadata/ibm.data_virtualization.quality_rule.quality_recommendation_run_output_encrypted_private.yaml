rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.quality_rule.quality_recommendation_run_output_encrypted_private
title: Enforce Encryption for Data Virtualization Quality Output
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the output of quality recommendation runs ensures that sensitive
  data is protected against unauthorized access and data breaches. This is crucial
  for maintaining customer trust and meeting compliance requirements, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personal and sensitive information through
  encryption.
description: This rule checks whether the output data from quality recommendation
  processes within IBM Data Virtualization is encrypted using robust, industry-standard
  encryption algorithms. By enforcing encryption at rest, the rule mitigates the risk
  of data exposure in case of unauthorized access to storage systems. This practice
  enhances data privacy and aligns with regulatory standards, ensuring that encryption
  controls are in place to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality across the
  cloud environment.
