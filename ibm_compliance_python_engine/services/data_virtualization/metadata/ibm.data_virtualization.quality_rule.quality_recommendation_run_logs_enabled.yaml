rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.quality_rule.quality_recommendation_run_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Quality Recommendation Run Logs are Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logs for quality recommendation runs in data virtualization ensures
  that all activities are recorded and can be audited. This is crucial for identifying
  unauthorized or suspicious activities, aiding in forensic investigations, and ensuring
  compliance with regulatory requirements. Logging also provides transparency in operations,
  helping businesses maintain trust with stakeholders by demonstrating robust security
  practices.
description: This rule checks whether logging for quality recommendation runs in IBM
  Cloud Data Virtualization is enabled. By ensuring that logs are captured, organizations
  can monitor the execution and results of quality recommendations, providing visibility
  into system operations. This improves security by enabling the detection of anomalies
  and unauthorized access attempts. Additionally, maintaining logs aligns with compliance
  frameworks that require audit trails for data processing activities, thereby supporting
  regulatory adherence and operational integrity.
