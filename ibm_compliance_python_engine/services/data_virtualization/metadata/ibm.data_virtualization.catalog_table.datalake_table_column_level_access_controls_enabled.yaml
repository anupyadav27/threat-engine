title: Ensure Column-Level Access Controls for Datalake Tables in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling column-level access controls for datalake tables is crucial to
  maintain data integrity and confidentiality by ensuring that users access only the
  specific data they are authorized to view. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure, which can lead to data breaches and compliance issues, ultimately
  protecting the organization's reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether column-level access controls are enabled for
  tables within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By enforcing these controls,
  organizations can implement fine-grained access management, allowing permissions
  to be set at the column level for datalake tables. This enhances data security by
  restricting access to sensitive information based on user roles and responsibilities,
  contributing to compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  Implementing column-level access controls also supports the principle of least privilege,
  ensuring that users have only the access necessary to perform their job duties.
