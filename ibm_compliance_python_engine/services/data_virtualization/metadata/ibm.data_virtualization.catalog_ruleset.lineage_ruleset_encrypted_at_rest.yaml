title: Ensuring Encryption for Lineage Ruleset in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the lineage ruleset at rest is crucial to safeguard sensitive
  metadata within the IBM Data Virtualization service. This ensures that data lineage
  information, which may contain sensitive operational insights, is protected against
  unauthorized access and potential breaches. Failing to encrypt such data could lead
  to compliance violations and erode customer trust if confidential information is
  exposed.
description: This rule verifies that the lineage ruleset within the IBM Data Virtualization
  service is encrypted at rest. It checks whether appropriate encryption mechanisms
  are in place to secure metadata, which includes details about data origin, movement,
  and transformation processes. By enforcing encryption at rest, organizations can
  mitigate risks associated with unauthorized data exposure, comply with regulatory
  requirements, and enhance their overall data protection strategy.
