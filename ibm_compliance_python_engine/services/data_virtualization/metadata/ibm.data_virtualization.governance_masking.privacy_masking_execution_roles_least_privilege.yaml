title: Ensure Least Privilege for Privacy Masking Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for privacy masking execution roles is crucial
  to minimizing the risk of unauthorized data access and manipulation. By ensuring
  that roles have only the necessary permissions, organizations can safeguard sensitive
  information, maintain compliance with data protection regulations, and reduce potential
  attack vectors that could lead to data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that execution roles associated with privacy masking
  in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service are configured with the least privilege
  necessary to perform their tasks. Ensuring least privilege means that roles are
  granted only the permissions essential for their function, thereby reducing the
  risk of excessive access rights that could be exploited in a security breach. This
  approach not only strengthens the security posture by limiting exposure to sensitive
  data but also aids in achieving compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls to protect personal data.
