title: Restrict Lineage Crawler Scope to Allowlist in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring the Lineage Crawler's scope is restricted to an allowlist is crucial
  for maintaining strict data governance and privacy standards. By limiting the crawler's
  access to predefined, trusted datasets, organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and comply with regulatory requirements, thereby protecting sensitive
  information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This security rule checks whether the Lineage Crawler in IBM Data Virtualization
  is restricted to an allowlist of approved data sources. By enforcing this configuration,
  organizations can ensure that the crawler only accesses data that has been vetted
  and approved for monitoring. This restriction not only enhances data privacy but
  also aligns with data protection regulations by preventing unauthorized data access.
  Compliance with this rule aids in achieving encryption at rest and reduces potential
  security vulnerabilities associated with unrestricted data access.
