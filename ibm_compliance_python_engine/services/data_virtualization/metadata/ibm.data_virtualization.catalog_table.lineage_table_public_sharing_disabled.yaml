title: Ensure Public Sharing Disabled for Lineage Tables in Data Virtualization
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling public sharing of lineage tables is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive metadata, which can lead to security breaches and data leaks.
  Ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users have access to this information
  helps maintain the integrity of data management processes and protects business-critical
  data from exposure.
description: This rule checks that lineage tables within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service are configured to prevent public sharing. By enforcing this restriction,
  organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized data exposure and ensure compliance
  with industry standards and regulations. This practice enhances the security posture
  by controlling access to metadata, which is a potential target for attackers seeking
  insights into data structures and relationships.
