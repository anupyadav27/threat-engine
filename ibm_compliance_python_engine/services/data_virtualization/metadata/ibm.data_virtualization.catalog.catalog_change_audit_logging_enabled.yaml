rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog.catalog_change_audit_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Catalog Change Audit Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling catalog change audit logging is crucial for maintaining a secure
  and compliant data virtualization environment. It provides a trail of who modified
  what in the data catalog, helping to detect unauthorized changes and ensuring accountability.
  This capability is essential for meeting regulatory requirements and safeguarding
  against data integrity issues.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging for catalog changes in IBM Cloud's
  data virtualization service is enabled. By ensuring this setting, organizations
  can capture detailed logs of all alterations made to catalog configurations, enabling
  them to monitor access and modifications effectively. This not only aids in forensic
  investigations and compliance audits but also enhances the organization's ability
  to respond promptly to potential security incidents. Adhering to this practice aligns
  with best practices for logging and monitoring, reinforcing the overall security
  posture of the cloud environment.
