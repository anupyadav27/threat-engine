title: Ensure Encryption of Lineage Schema in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the lineage schema in IBM Data Virtualization is crucial to
  protect sensitive metadata from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By ensuring encryption at rest, organizations can safeguard the integrity and confidentiality
  of data lineage information, which is essential for compliance with data protection
  regulations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the lineage schema within the IBM Data Virtualization
  service is encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest involves encoding stored data to
  prevent unauthorized users from accessing it without the appropriate decryption
  key, thereby enhancing data security. Implementing encryption at rest not only aligns
  with industry best practices but also assists in meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby reducing legal risks and promoting a robust security
  posture.
