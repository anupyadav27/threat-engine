title: Enforce Version Immutability for Data Virtualization Quality Rulesets
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring version immutability of quality rulesets in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security. Immutability prevents
  unauthorized or accidental modifications, which can lead to data breaches or compliance
  violations, impacting business operations and reputation. It also facilitates traceable
  data quality checks, essential for audit trails and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks that all quality rulesets within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service are configured with immutable versions. Immutability ensures that once a
  ruleset is created and deployed, it cannot be altered, thus preserving the integrity
  of data quality processes and ensuring consistent application of data governance
  policies. By enforcing version immutability, organizations enhance their security
  posture by mitigating risks associated with unauthorized changes, while also aligning
  with data protection and privacy regulations. This practice supports compliance
  with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which demand strict control over data processing
  activities.
