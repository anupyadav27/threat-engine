title: Enforce Private Network for Lineage Crawler in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing the use of private networks for the Lineage Crawler in IBM Data
  Virtualization is essential to minimize exposure to potential threats and unauthorized
  access. By restricting network accessibility to private connections, organizations
  can enhance data security, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible
  within a controlled and secure environment. This measure helps in maintaining data
  integrity and compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that the Lineage Crawler within IBM Data Virtualization
  operates exclusively over private networks, preventing any public network exposure.
  By ensuring that the crawler is confined to a private network, the risk of data
  breaches and unauthorized access is significantly reduced. This practice not only
  strengthens the security posture of the organization but also aligns with compliance
  mandates by safeguarding sensitive data during the data lineage tracking process.
  Implementing this rule helps organizations maintain a robust network security framework,
  thereby mitigating potential vulnerabilities associated with public network exposure.
