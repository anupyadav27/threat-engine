rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.lineage_job_logs_and_metrics_enabled
title: Ensure Lineage Job Logs and Metrics are Enabled in Data Virtualization Jobs
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling lineage job logs and metrics is crucial for maintaining comprehensive
  audit trails and operational transparency in data virtualization environments. This
  practice supports effective monitoring and troubleshooting, ensuring that data processing
  activities are traceable and accountable, which helps in identifying and mitigating
  potential security threats and operational inefficiencies.
description: This rule verifies that lineage job logs and metrics are enabled for
  jobs within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By ensuring these logs and
  metrics are active, organizations can gain visibility into data processing activities,
  aiding in the detection of unauthorized access or anomalies. This enhances security
  by facilitating real-time monitoring and historical analysis, and it supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements that mandate detailed audit trails and operational
  oversight.
