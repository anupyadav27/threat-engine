title: Enforce Least Privilege in Analytics Catalog RBAC for Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege within the Analytics Catalog
  ensures that users have only the access necessary to perform their roles, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. This rule is critical for maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality, preventing potential misuse of sensitive data,
  and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards which can have significant business
  and legal implications.
description: This security rule verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings
  in the Analytics Catalog are configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It checks that users and roles are granted only the permissions necessary for their
  specific tasks. By enforcing this practice, organizations can minimize security
  vulnerabilities, prevent privilege escalation, and ensure that access to data is
  strictly controlled. This enhances overall security posture and aids in compliance
  with security frameworks and regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, by ensuring that
  data access is limited and auditable.
