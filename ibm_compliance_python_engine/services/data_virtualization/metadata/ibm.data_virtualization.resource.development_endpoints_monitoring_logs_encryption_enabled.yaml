title: Ensure Encryption of Development Endpoint Monitoring Logs in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting development endpoint monitoring logs is crucial to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption, logs can
  expose critical information that might be exploited by malicious actors, leading
  to data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards. Implementing encryption
  safeguards the integrity and confidentiality of the logs, supporting an organization's
  commitment to data protection and privacy.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for monitoring logs generated
  by development endpoints within IBM Data Virtualization services. Enabling encryption
  ensures that the data is stored securely at rest, preventing unauthorized access
  and exposure of sensitive information. This measure not only enhances the overall
  security posture by safeguarding against potential data leaks but also aligns with
  compliance requirements for data protection and privacy standards, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. By enforcing encryption at rest, organizations mitigate risks associated
  with data breaches and maintain trustworthiness in handling sensitive data.
