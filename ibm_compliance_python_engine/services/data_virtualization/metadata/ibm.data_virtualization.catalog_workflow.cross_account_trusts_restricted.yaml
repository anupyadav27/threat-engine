title: Enforce Cross-Account Trust Restrictions in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account trusts in data virtualization workflows is critical
  to reducing unauthorized access to sensitive data. By limiting exposure to only
  trusted accounts, organizations can mitigate risks of data breaches and ensure compliance
  with data protection regulations, thereby safeguarding business integrity and customer
  trust.
description: This rule verifies that cross-account trust relationships within the
  data virtualization service's catalog workflows are configured to restrict access
  only to approved accounts. By enforcing these restrictions, it prevents unauthorized
  entities from accessing sensitive data stored in the data virtualization environment.
  Implementing such constraints enhances data protection by ensuring that encryption
  at rest is effectively complemented by access control measures, supporting compliance
  with industry standards and legal requirements for data privacy and security.
