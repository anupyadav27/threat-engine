title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage ML Transform Role in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for the Lineage ML Transform
  role in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service is crucial for minimizing security
  risks. Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  potential misuse of sensitive information. By restricting permissions to only those
  necessary for the role, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect
  critical data assets while maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule ensures that the Lineage ML Transform role within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service adheres to the principle of least privilege. It verifies
  that the role is assigned only the permissions necessary to perform its intended
  functions, minimizing exposure to potential security threats. Enforcing least privilege
  helps prevent unauthorized access and modification of data, reducing the risk of
  data breaches and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. Regularly reviewing and adjusting role permissions as needed can further
  bolster an organization's security framework.
