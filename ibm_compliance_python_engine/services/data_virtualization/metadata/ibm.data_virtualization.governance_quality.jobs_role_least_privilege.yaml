title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Governance Quality Jobs
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for data virtualization governance
  quality jobs is critical to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This rule ensures that users and service accounts only have access
  to the resources necessary for their specific roles, thereby reducing the attack
  surface and protecting sensitive information.
description: This rule checks whether the permissions assigned to users and roles
  involved in managing and executing governance quality jobs within IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service adhere to the principle of least privilege. By enforcing
  this rule, organizations can ensure that access rights are strictly controlled,
  which helps prevent misuse or exploitation. Adhering to this principle not only
  strengthens the security posture but also supports compliance with various regulatory
  standards that mandate access controls and data protection measures.
