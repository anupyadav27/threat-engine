rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.governance_anonymization.privacy_anonymization_outputs_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for Privacy Anonymization Outputs in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that privacy anonymization outputs are encrypted is crucial for
  protecting sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Encrypting these outputs not only safeguards the integrity and confidentiality of
  the data but also helps organizations comply with stringent data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby avoiding legal penalties and maintaining customer
  trust.
description: This rule verifies that all outputs from the governance anonymization
  processes within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service are encrypted at rest.
  By implementing encryption, it mitigates the risk of data exposure due to unauthorized
  access or data theft. This practice enhances the overall security posture of the
  organization by ensuring that sensitive information remains protected, supporting
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection
  and privacy.
