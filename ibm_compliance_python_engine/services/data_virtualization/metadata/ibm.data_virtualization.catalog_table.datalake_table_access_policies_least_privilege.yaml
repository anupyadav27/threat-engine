title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Lake Table Access in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access policies for data lake tables ensures
  that users and services have only the necessary permissions to perform their functions.
  This minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches,
  protecting sensitive business information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule evaluates data lake table access policies within IBM Cloud's
  data virtualization service to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It checks that permissions granted to users and services are restricted to the minimum
  required for their roles, reducing the attack surface and preventing excessive access
  that could lead to data misuse. By enforcing this rule, organizations can enhance
  their security posture, comply with regulatory requirements, and mitigate the risk
  of insider threats and unintentional data leaks.
