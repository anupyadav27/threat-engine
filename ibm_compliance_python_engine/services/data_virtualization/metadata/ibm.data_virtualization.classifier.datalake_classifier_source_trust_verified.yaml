title: Ensure Trust Verification for Datalake Classifier Sources in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Verifying the trustworthiness of datalake classifier sources is crucial
  to maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized access. Data sources that
  are not properly vetted can introduce vulnerabilities, leading to potential data
  breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations. Ensuring trust verification
  helps organizations protect sensitive information and maintain customer trust.
description: This rule checks if the sources used by the datalake classifiers in IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service have been properly verified for trust. By implementing
  trust verification, the rule ensures that only validated and secure data sources
  are utilized in data processing and analysis, reducing the risk of malicious data
  infiltration. This practice not only enhances data security but also supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations concerning data protection and privacy.
