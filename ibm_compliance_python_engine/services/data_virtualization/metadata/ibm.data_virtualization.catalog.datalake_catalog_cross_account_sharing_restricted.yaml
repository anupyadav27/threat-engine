title: Ensure Restricted Cross-Account Sharing for Datalake Catalogs
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of datalake catalogs is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This control helps safeguard sensitive
  data by ensuring that only authorized accounts have access, mitigating the risk
  of data exfiltration. By enforcing this restriction, organizations can maintain
  the integrity and confidentiality of their data assets, which is vital for maintaining
  customer trust and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow unrestricted cross-account
  sharing of datalake catalogs within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By
  ensuring that cross-account sharing is restricted, this rule enhances the security
  of data assets by limiting access to authorized accounts only. Implementing this
  control helps in achieving compliance with industry-standard data protection frameworks
  and regulations by ensuring that data sharing practices align with security policies
  and access control requirements. This rule contributes to a robust security posture
  by enabling audit logging and monitoring of access patterns, providing visibility
  into potential unauthorized access attempts.
