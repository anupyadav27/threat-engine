title: Enforce Version Pinning for Data Virtualization Catalog Rulesets
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that catalog rulesets in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization have their
  versions pinned is crucial for maintaining a stable and secure environment. Unpinned
  versions can inadvertently lead to the usage of newer, possibly incompatible, or
  insecure versions that might introduce vulnerabilities or degrade performance. By
  pinning versions, organizations can manage changes more effectively, reducing the
  risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.
description: This rule verifies that every catalog ruleset in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  has an explicitly specified version, ensuring that updates do not occur without
  prior testing and approval. Version pinning prevents unexpected changes that could
  exploit vulnerabilities or introduce new security issues. By adhering to this practice,
  organizations can ensure that data remains encrypted at rest under consistent, controlled
  conditions, aiding compliance with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  This proactive measure not only enhances the security posture but also maintains
  the integrity and availability of the data processing environment.
