title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Database Policies in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring least privilege in datalake database policies minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By restricting permissions to
  the absolute minimum necessary for operation, organizations can protect sensitive
  data from internal and external threats, thereby maintaining data integrity and
  compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that datalake database policies within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks
  that user roles and permissions are configured to allow only the necessary access
  required for their specific tasks. Implementing least privilege reduces the attack
  surface, limits potential damage from compromised accounts, and aligns with compliance
  frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA by safeguarding sensitive information. This practice
  is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment.
