rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.database.lineage_database_policy_least_privilege
title: Implement Least Privilege in Lineage Database Policies
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that database access policies adhere to the principle of least
  privilege is critical in minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  access to sensitive data. By restricting permissions to only those necessary for
  users to perform their job functions, organizations can significantly reduce the
  risk of data breaches and insider threats. This approach not only protects sensitive
  information but also aligns with regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule evaluates the policies associated with the lineage database
  in the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service to ensure they adhere to the least
  privilege principle. It scrutinizes the access permissions assigned to various roles
  and users, confirming that they are limited to the minimum necessary for their responsibilities.
  By enforcing granular access controls, this rule enhances the security posture by
  mitigating potential exploitation risks and ensuring compliance with industry standards
  and regulations. Implementing such policies helps organizations maintain robust
  identity and access management practices, safeguarding critical business data.
