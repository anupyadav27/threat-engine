rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.lineage.datalake_lineage_export_destination_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption for Datalake Lineage Export Destinations
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting data lineage export destinations with encryption is crucial
  for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially when dealing with
  sensitive information. Failing to encrypt these exports could lead to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, adversely affecting the organization's compliance
  posture and reputation.
description: This rule ensures that all export destinations for datalake lineage data
  are encrypted at rest, leveraging IBM Cloud's encryption capabilities. By enforcing
  encryption, this rule mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access and data
  leaks, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of data virtualization environments.
  Moreover, this practice aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  for data protection, helping organizations maintain compliance with frameworks such
  as GDPR and HIPAA.
