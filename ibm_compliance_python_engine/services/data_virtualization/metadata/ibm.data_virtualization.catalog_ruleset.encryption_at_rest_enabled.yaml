title: Enforce Encryption at Rest for IBM Data Virtualization Catalog Rulesets
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for data virtualization catalog rulesets is
  crucial for protecting sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This security measure ensures that even if physical storage devices
  are compromised, the data remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption
  keys, thereby safeguarding business-critical information and maintaining customer
  trust.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for all
  catalog rulesets within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By implementing this
  control, organizations enhance their data protection strategy, ensuring that all
  stored data is encrypted using robust algorithms. This not only fortifies the security
  posture but also aids in compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures. The rule checks for the
  presence of encryption configurations and validates their adequacy against industry
  standards.
