title: Enforce Immutability of Lineage Schema Versions in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing the immutability of lineage schema versions ensures data integrity
  and prevents unauthorized or accidental modifications that could compromise data
  lineage tracking. This is crucial for maintaining accurate audit logs and ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations, thereby safeguarding sensitive business
  information and enhancing trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule checks whether the immutability of lineage schema versions
  is enforced within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that schema
  versions cannot be altered once created, the rule helps maintain a consistent and
  reliable record of data lineage. This practice enhances security by preventing unauthorized
  changes and supports compliance efforts by providing a verifiable audit trail of
  data transformations. Adhering to this rule aligns with best practices for data
  protection and privacy, particularly in environments requiring strict encryption
  and data governance measures.
