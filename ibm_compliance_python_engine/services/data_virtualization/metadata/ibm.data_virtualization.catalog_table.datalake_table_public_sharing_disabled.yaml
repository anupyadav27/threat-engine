rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_table.datalake_table_public_sharing_disabled
title: Restrict Public Sharing of Datalake Tables in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling public sharing of datalake tables is crucial for preventing unauthorized
  access to sensitive data. Publicly accessible tables pose a significant security
  risk, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations.
  Ensuring that datalake tables are not shared publicly protects organizational data
  assets and maintains trust with clients and stakeholders.
description: This security rule evaluates the configuration of IBM Data Virtualization
  catalog tables to ensure that public sharing is disabled. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can prevent unauthorized users from accessing datalake tables, thereby
  mitigating risks associated with data exposure. This practice aligns with compliance
  frameworks that mandate strict access controls and supports the principle of least
  privilege, enhancing overall data security posture. The rule is critical in maintaining
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require
  stringent data access controls.
