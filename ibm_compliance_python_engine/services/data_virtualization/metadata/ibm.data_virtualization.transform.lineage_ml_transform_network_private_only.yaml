rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.transform.lineage_ml_transform_network_private_only
title: Ensure Lineage ML Transform Operates on Private Networks Only
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting the Lineage ML Transform operations to private networks enhances
  security by minimizing the exposure to public internet threats. This measure helps
  protect sensitive data and proprietary machine learning models from unauthorized
  access, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data privacy
  regulations.
description: This rule checks if the Lineage ML Transform resources in the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service are configured to operate only within private networks.
  By enforcing private network usage, the rule ensures that data traffic remains within
  the secure boundaries of the organization's network, thereby reducing the attack
  surface. This configuration aligns with best practices in network security by implementing
  stricter access controls, thus providing an additional layer of protection for critical
  data assets and supporting compliance with industry standards.
