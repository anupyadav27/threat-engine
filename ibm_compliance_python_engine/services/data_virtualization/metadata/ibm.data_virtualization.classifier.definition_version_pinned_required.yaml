title: Ensure Definition Version Pinning for Data Virtualization Classifiers
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Pinning the definition version of classifiers in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  is crucial to maintaining consistent classification behavior and ensuring data protection.
  Without pinning, classifiers may automatically update to newer versions, potentially
  leading to unverified changes in classification logic that could expose sensitive
  data or violate data protection policies.
description: This rule verifies that the version of classifier definitions used in
  IBM Cloud Data Virtualization is explicitly pinned. By enforcing version pinning,
  organizations can control and audit the specific version of classifiers being utilized,
  ensuring they have been tested and approved for compliance with data protection
  standards. This practice mitigates risks associated with unintended classification
  changes and supports adherence to encryption at rest requirements, enhancing overall
  data security posture.
