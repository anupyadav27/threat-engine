title: Enforce Private Networking for Datalake Connections
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for datalake connections is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. It ensures that
  data traffic is isolated from public networks, reducing the risk of exposure to
  malicious actors. This enhances overall data security and supports compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all datalake connections within IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service are configured to use private networking. By enforcing private
  networking, data traffic is restricted to secure, internal channels, preventing
  exposure to the public internet. This measure significantly enhances the security
  posture by minimizing attack vectors and ensuring sensitive data remains within
  trusted network boundaries. Compliance with this rule helps organizations adhere
  to industry standards and regulatory requirements for data security and privacy.
