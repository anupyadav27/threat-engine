rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.crawler.datalake_crawler_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Data Lake Crawler Logs are Enabled for Comprehensive Audit Trails
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for Data Lake Crawler activities ensures that all operations
  performed by the crawler are recorded, providing a vital audit trail. This is crucial
  for detecting unauthorized access, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining accountability
  within your data virtualization environment. Failure to maintain these logs can
  result in data breaches going undetected, which may lead to compliance violations
  and potential financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for Data Lake Crawlers in
  IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that crawler logs are active,
  organizations gain enhanced visibility into data access and modification activities,
  which is essential for forensic analysis and incident response. Enabling logs supports
  compliance with industry standards and regulations by providing evidence of data
  governance and security controls. This proactive measure not only secures sensitive
  data but also aids in demonstrating adherence to security best practices during
  audits.
