title: Ensure Minimum Retention Days for Privacy Audit Logs in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for privacy audit logs ensures that
  critical data related to access and modifications within the Data Virtualization
  service is available for a sufficient period to support forensic investigations
  and compliance audits. Failure to retain logs for an adequate duration can lead
  to gaps in audit trails, potentially hindering the identification of unauthorized
  access attempts or compliance violations, which can have significant legal and financial
  repercussions for the organization.
description: This rule verifies whether the Data Virtualization service within IBM
  Cloud has a minimum retention period configured for privacy audit logs. By ensuring
  that audit logs are retained for a specified minimum duration, organizations can
  enhance their ability to perform comprehensive security audits and investigations.
  This practice not only strengthens the security posture by enabling the detection
  and analysis of unauthorized activities but also helps meet regulatory compliance
  requirements related to data privacy and security. Regularly reviewing and setting
  a minimum retention period for audit logs is a best practice for maintaining robust
  security and compliance standards.
