rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.quality_rule.parameters_no_plaintext_secrets
title: Ensure No Plaintext Secrets in Data Virtualization Parameters
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: The use of plaintext secrets in data virtualization parameters poses a
  significant security risk, as it makes sensitive information vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Encrypting secrets at rest ensures the confidentiality
  and integrity of data, aligning with industry best practices and regulatory compliance
  requirements. This rule is crucial for maintaining client trust and protecting critical
  business data from malicious actors.
description: This security rule enforces the prohibition of plaintext secrets within
  data virtualization parameters by ensuring all sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
  It checks for the presence of unencrypted secrets in configuration parameters and
  flags them for remediation. By implementing this rule, organizations can significantly
  enhance their security posture, prevent unauthorized data exposure, and meet compliance
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Encrypting data at rest not only safeguards sensitive
  information but also mitigates the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access, thereby
  protecting the organization's reputation and customer trust.
