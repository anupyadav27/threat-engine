rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.datalake_job_role_least_privilege
title: Ensure Datalake Job Roles Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Applying the principle of least privilege to datalake job roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches by ensuring that users
  and systems have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This approach
  not only enhances security by reducing the attack surface but also ensures compliance
  with industry regulations and corporate governance policies, ultimately protecting
  critical data assets.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions associated with roles assigned to
  datalake jobs in the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service, ensuring they adhere
  to the principle of least privilege. By enforcing strict role-based access controls,
  this rule ensures that users and systems can only access resources necessary for
  their specific functions. Implementing this control helps prevent privilege escalation
  and unauthorized data access, thereby strengthening the overall security posture
  of the cloud environment. Compliance with this rule aids organizations in meeting
  regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls
  and data protection measures.
