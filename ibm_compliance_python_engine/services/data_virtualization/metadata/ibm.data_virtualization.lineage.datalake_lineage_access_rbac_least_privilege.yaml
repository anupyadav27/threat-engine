title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Lineage Access via RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  for datalake lineage ensures that users have only the necessary permissions to perform
  their job functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure. This is crucial
  for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data, thus protecting
  against internal and external threats, and ensuring compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This rule verifies that RBAC is configured to enforce the principle of
  least privilege for accessing datalake lineage information within the IBM Cloud
  data virtualization service. By ensuring that access rights are minimized and closely
  aligned with user roles, the rule helps prevent unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Properly configured RBAC not only enhances security by limiting data
  exposure but also aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access controls over sensitive data.
