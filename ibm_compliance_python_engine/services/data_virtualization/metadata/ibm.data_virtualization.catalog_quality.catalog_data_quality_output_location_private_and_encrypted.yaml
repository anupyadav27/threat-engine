rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_quality.catalog_data_quality_output_location_private_and_encrypted
title: Ensure Data Virtualization Catalog Data Quality Outputs are Private and Encrypted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting data quality outputs by ensuring they are stored privately and
  encrypted is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. This practice
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, safeguarding
  sensitive business data against external threats and ensuring compliance with data
  protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether the output location for data quality results
  within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service is configured to be both private
  and encrypted. By enforcing encryption at rest, it ensures that data remains secure
  even in the event of unauthorized access to storage systems. Additionally, setting
  the location to private restricts access to only authorized personnel, further enhancing
  data security. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry standards
  and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
