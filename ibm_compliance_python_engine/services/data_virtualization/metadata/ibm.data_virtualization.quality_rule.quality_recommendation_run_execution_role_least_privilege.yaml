title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Quality Recommendation Execution
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for roles in data virtualization minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By restricting execution
  roles to only the necessary permissions, organizations can reduce the attack surface
  and protect sensitive data, thereby maintaining trust and compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule checks that execution roles associated with data virtualization
  quality recommendations adhere to the principle of least privilege. By ensuring
  that these roles have only the permissions necessary to perform their functions,
  this rule enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
  Compliance with this rule aids in aligning with industry best practices and regulatory
  standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls to safeguard
  data integrity and privacy.
