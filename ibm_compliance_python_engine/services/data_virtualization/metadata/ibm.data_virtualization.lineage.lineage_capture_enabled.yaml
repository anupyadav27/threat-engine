title: Ensure Lineage Capture is Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling lineage capture within Data Virtualization is essential for tracking
  the flow and transformation of data across systems. This capability enhances data
  governance by providing visibility into data usage and lineage, which is crucial
  for compliance with data protection regulations. Failure to enable lineage capture
  can result in a lack of accountability and insight, potentially leading to non-compliance
  with industry standards and increased risk of data mishandling.
description: This rule verifies that lineage capture is enabled for the Data Virtualization
  service within IBM Cloud. Lineage capture records the origins, movement, and transformations
  applied to data, thereby providing a comprehensive audit trail. This practice strengthens
  security by maintaining data integrity and supports compliance with data protection
  and privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Enabling lineage capture helps organizations
  to ensure transparency, improve data quality, and facilitate efficient audits, contributing
  to overall data protection and privacy.
