title: Ensure Datalake Classifier Definition Version is Pinned
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Pinning the version of the Datalake Classifier Definition is crucial for
  maintaining consistent and secure operations within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service. It prevents unexpected changes that may introduce vulnerabilities or compliance
  issues, ensuring that data classification processes remain stable and aligned with
  security policies. This practice minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or data
  breaches, safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that the Datalake Classifier Definition in IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service has a specified version pinned. By enforcing version
  pinning, organizations can control and audit the exact version of classifier definitions
  being used, mitigating risks associated with untested or unauthorized changes. This
  approach enhances security by ensuring that all data classification adheres to established
  standards, contributing to robust data protection and privacy. Furthermore, it aligns
  with encryption at rest policies by ensuring that only approved and secure classification
  definitions are in use, thus supporting compliance with industry regulations.
