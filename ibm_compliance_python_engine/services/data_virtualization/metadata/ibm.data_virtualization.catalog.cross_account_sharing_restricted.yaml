title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing in Data Virtualization Catalogs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing restrictions on cross-account sharing in data virtualization
  catalogs is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining privacy. Uncontrolled
  sharing of data across accounts can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  and compliance violations, ultimately impacting business integrity and customer
  trust.
description: This rule checks for configurations in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  that permit cross-account sharing of catalog resources. By limiting such sharing
  capabilities, organizations can enforce stronger access controls and mitigate risks
  associated with data leakage. This enhances overall data security posture and ensures
  compliance with data protection regulations by ensuring that data remains encrypted
  and accessible only to authorized entities within the same account.
