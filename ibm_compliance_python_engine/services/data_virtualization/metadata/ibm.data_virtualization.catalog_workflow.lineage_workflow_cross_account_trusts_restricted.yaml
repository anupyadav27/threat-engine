title: Restrict Cross-Account Trusts in Data Virtualization Lineage Workflows
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Limiting cross-account trusts in data virtualization lineage workflows
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. By restricting these
  trusts, organizations can ensure that sensitive data remains protected within its
  intended boundaries, thereby safeguarding against potential data exfiltration and
  maintaining data privacy compliance.
description: This rule evaluates the configuration of lineage workflows within IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service to ensure that cross-account trusts are minimized
  or restricted. By implementing this control, organizations enhance their security
  posture by reducing the risk of unauthorized data access from other accounts. This
  approach not only fortifies data protection but also helps organizations adhere
  to stringent data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, by ensuring that data
  access is limited and closely monitored.
