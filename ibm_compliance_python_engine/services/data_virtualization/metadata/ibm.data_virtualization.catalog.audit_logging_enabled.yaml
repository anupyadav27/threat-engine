rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog.audit_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization Catalogs
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for data virtualization catalogs is crucial for
  maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. It provides visibility into
  access and modification activities, helping detect unauthorized access, data breaches,
  or policy violations. This proactive measure not only fortifies data protection
  but also aids in forensic investigations and compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for catalogs
  within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. The rule ensures that all access
  and management activities related to the catalog are recorded, providing a comprehensive
  audit trail. Implementing audit logging enhances security by enabling the detection
  and analysis of suspicious activities, thereby improving incident response capabilities.
  Moreover, it supports compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory
  frameworks that mandate thorough logging and monitoring of data access and modification.
