title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage Quality Role in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for the Lineage Quality Role
  in IBM Data Virtualization minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  By restricting user permissions to only what is necessary for their role, organizations
  can better prevent potential misuse or accidental exposure of sensitive data, thereby
  maintaining trust and compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule ensures that the Lineage Quality Role within IBM Data Virtualization
  is configured according to the least privilege principle, which involves granting
  users the minimal level of access necessary to perform their job functions. The
  rule checks for excessive permissions and helps to identify and remediate unnecessary
  access rights, thereby reducing the attack surface and improving the overall security
  posture. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to security standards and
  regulatory requirements, safeguarding critical data assets against unauthorized
  access.
