title: Enforce Least Privilege in Data Virtualization Lineage Registry RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in the Lineage Registry within
  IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service is vital to minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Ensuring that users and applications have only
  the permissions necessary to perform their functions helps protect sensitive data
  and maintain regulatory compliance, thus safeguarding business operations and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that role-based access control (RBAC) for the Lineage
  Registry in the Catalog Registry adheres to the least privilege principle. It checks
  that permissions granted to users and services are limited strictly to what is necessary
  for their roles, reducing the attack surface and potential misuse of privileges.
  By enforcing least privilege, organizations can enhance their security posture,
  ensuring compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, and reducing the likelihood
  of insider threats and external attacks.
