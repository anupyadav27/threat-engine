rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_table.encryption_at_rest_enabled
title: Mandatory Encryption at Rest for Catalog Tables in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for catalog tables in data virtualization is
  crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  Encryption ensures that even if physical storage media are compromised, the data
  remains unintelligible without the proper decryption keys. This is especially important
  for maintaining customer trust and complying with data protection regulations such
  as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent data security measures.
description: This rule checks whether catalog tables in the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  service have encryption at rest enabled. By ensuring that all stored data is encrypted,
  the rule mitigates risks of data exposure due to unauthorized access or physical
  theft of storage devices. Implementing encryption at rest not only enhances the
  overall security posture of the organization but also aids in achieving regulatory
  compliance by safeguarding sensitive information against data breaches and ensuring
  data integrity.
