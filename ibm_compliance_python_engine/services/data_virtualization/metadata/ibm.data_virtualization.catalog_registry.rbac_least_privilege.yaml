rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_registry.rbac_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege in Data Virtualization Catalog RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege within the Data Virtualization
  Catalog ensures that users have only the access necessary to perform their tasks,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure. This security measure minimizes
  potential attack vectors and helps maintain compliance with regulatory standards,
  ultimately protecting sensitive business data from misuse or breaches.
description: This rule evaluates the role-based access control (RBAC) settings within
  the Data Virtualization Catalog to verify that permissions align with the least
  privilege principle. By restricting user access rights to the minimum required,
  organizations can prevent unauthorized access and potential data leaks. This approach
  not only bolsters security posture but also aids in achieving compliance with data
  protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that access policies are
  consistently enforced and audited.
