title: Ensure Data Catalogs Metadata Encryption is Enabled in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling metadata encryption for data catalogs within IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access and
  breaches. Encrypting metadata ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed
  by malicious actors, it remains unintelligible without the appropriate decryption
  keys. This not only protects the integrity and confidentiality of your data but
  also helps in maintaining customer trust and complying with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether metadata encryption is enabled for data catalogs
  in the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By enforcing encryption-at-rest for
  data catalogs, organizations can secure sensitive metadata against potential threats
  and unauthorized access. This practice is aligned with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements for data protection, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected
  even when stored within the cloud infrastructure. Enabling metadata encryption aids
  in maintaining compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection
  laws, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and associated penalties.
