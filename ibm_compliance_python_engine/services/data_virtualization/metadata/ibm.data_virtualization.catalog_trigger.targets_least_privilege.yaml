title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Catalog Triggers
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for catalog triggers in Data
  Virtualization ensures that only necessary permissions are granted, minimizing potential
  attack vectors. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches,
  safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks that catalog triggers in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service are configured with the least privilege necessary for operation. By enforcing
  least privilege, it limits access to only those users and services that absolutely
  require it, thereby reducing the potential attack surface. This approach not only
  enhances security by preventing excessive access rights but also aligns with compliance
  frameworks that mandate strict access controls to protect sensitive data.
