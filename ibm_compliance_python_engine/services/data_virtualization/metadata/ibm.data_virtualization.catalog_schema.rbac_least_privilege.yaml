title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Catalog Schemas
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with the least privilege
  principle is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
  data within IBM Cloud's data virtualization services. By restricting access rights
  based on the user's role, organizations can better protect their data assets, thus
  reducing the potential for data breaches and ensuring compliance with regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule ensures that RBAC policies for catalog schemas within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service adhere to the least privilege principle. It checks that
  user roles are configured to grant only the necessary permissions required to perform
  their job functions. This approach not only enhances security by limiting exposure
  of sensitive data but also supports compliance with various data protection regulations
  by enforcing strict access controls. Implementing least privilege helps to minimize
  the attack surface and potential insider threats, contributing to a robust security
  posture.
