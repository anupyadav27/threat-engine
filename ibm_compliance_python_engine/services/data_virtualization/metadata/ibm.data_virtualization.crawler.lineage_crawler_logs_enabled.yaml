title: Ensure Lineage Crawler Logs Are Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling lineage crawler logs is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of data access and transformation activities within the IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization service. This practice enhances security by allowing organizations
  to detect unauthorized access and anomalies, thereby safeguarding sensitive information.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with industry regulations by ensuring data
  activities are documented and traceable.
description: This rule checks whether lineage crawler logging is enabled for crawlers
  in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By enabling these logs, organizations
  can monitor and record all data lineage activities, providing insights into how
  data is accessed and manipulated. This not only strengthens security by identifying
  potential data breaches but also aids in compliance with regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which require detailed audit logs of data handling processes. Ensuring
  that lineage crawler logs are enabled allows organizations to maintain transparency
  and accountability in their data management practices.
