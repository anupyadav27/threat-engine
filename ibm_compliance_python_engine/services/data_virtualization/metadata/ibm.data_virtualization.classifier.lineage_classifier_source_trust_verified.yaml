title: Ensure Trust Verification for Lineage Classifier Source in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Trust verification of lineage classifier sources is crucial in ensuring
  the integrity and reliability of data processing workflows. By confirming the authenticity
  and trustworthiness of data sources, organizations can prevent unauthorized data
  manipulation, which could lead to inaccurate analytics and business decisions, as
  well as potential compliance violations.
description: This rule checks that all data sources used by the lineage classifier
  in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service have their trust verified. This involves
  confirming that data origins are secure and authenticated, thereby reducing the
  risk of exposure to compromised or malicious data. Implementing this security measure
  enhances data protection, supports compliance with data privacy regulations, and
  maintains the integrity of data analytics operations by ensuring only verified data
  sources are utilized.
