title: Restrict Data Virtualization Crawler Scope to Approved Allowlist
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting the scope of data virtualization crawlers to a predefined allowlist
  is crucial for maintaining data security and privacy. This rule helps prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive data by ensuring that only approved datasets are included in
  the crawling process, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether the data virtualization crawler in IBM Cloud
  is configured to operate only within an allowlist of approved data sources. By restricting
  the crawler's scope, organizations can enforce strict access controls over which
  datasets are analyzed, mitigating the risk of unauthorized data exposure. This practice
  not only enhances the overall security posture by limiting potential attack vectors
  but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations that
  require stringent data protection measures. Adhering to this rule ensures that data
  encryption at rest is effectively complemented by access controls that guard against
  unauthorized data access.
