title: Ensure Lineage Export Destination is Encrypted in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encryption of the lineage export destination is crucial for protecting
  sensitive metadata that maps data flow across systems. Unencrypted data can be vulnerable
  to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with
  data protection regulations. Ensuring encryption enhances data confidentiality and
  maintains customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that the destination for lineage exports in IBM Data
  Virtualization is encrypted. By enforcing encryption at rest, it safeguards exported
  metadata against unauthorized access and data breaches. This practice aligns with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection, ensuring that
  sensitive information remains secure even when stored. Compliance with this rule
  helps organizations protect their data assets and meet legal obligations related
  to data privacy and security.
