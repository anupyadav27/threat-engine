title: Ensure Encryption of Data Virtualization Catalog Partitions at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting catalog partitions at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This rule helps safeguard
  data integrity and confidentiality, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  and maintaining the trust of stakeholders.
description: This security rule verifies that all catalog partitions within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service are encrypted at rest. By implementing encryption, the
  data is protected from unauthorized access and breaches, even if the physical storage
  media is compromised. This measure not only enhances the security posture of your
  cloud environment but also aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  for data protection and privacy. Ensuring encryption at rest mitigates risks associated
  with data exposure and contributes to a robust security framework.
