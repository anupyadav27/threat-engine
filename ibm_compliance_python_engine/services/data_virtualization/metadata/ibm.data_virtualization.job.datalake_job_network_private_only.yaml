rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.datalake_job_network_private_only
title: Ensure Datalake Job Network is Restricted to Private Access Only
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting Datalake job network access to private networks is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. By
  ensuring that jobs run within a private network, organizations can reduce exposure
  to external threats and maintain data integrity and confidentiality, which is vital
  for compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all Datalake jobs within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  service are configured to operate exclusively over private network connections.
  By doing so, it minimizes the risk of data exposure to the public internet, thereby
  enhancing the security posture of the organization. Implementing this control helps
  in safeguarding sensitive information and aligns with industry best practices for
  network security, thus supporting compliance with various regulatory standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA.
