title: Enforce Least Privilege RBAC in Data Virtualization Catalog Rulesets
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in role-based access control
  (RBAC) is crucial for minimizing potential security risks. By ensuring that users
  and applications have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks, organizations
  can significantly reduce the attack surface, thereby lowering the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. This practice is essential for maintaining compliance
  with regulations and protecting sensitive data assets.
description: This security rule checks that the catalog rulesets within IBM Cloud's
  data virtualization service adhere to the least privilege principle in their RBAC
  configurations. It ensures that permissions are granted strictly based on necessity,
  aligning with best practices for identity and access management. By enforcing this
  rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by preventing excessive privileges
  that could lead to inadvertent misuse or exploitation. This approach not only improves
  overall security but also aligns with regulatory compliance standards that require
  strict access controls.
