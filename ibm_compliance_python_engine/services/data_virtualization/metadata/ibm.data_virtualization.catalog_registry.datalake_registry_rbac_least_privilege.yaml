title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Registry RBAC in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in Datalake Registry Role-Based
  Access Control (RBAC) is crucial to minimize potential security risks. By ensuring
  that users have only the necessary permissions, organizations can reduce the attack
  surface and prevent unauthorized access, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and
  maintaining trust.
description: This rule checks the permissions granted through RBAC in the Datalake
  Registry to ensure they adhere to the least privilege principle. It evaluates the
  roles and permissions assigned to users, verifying that they are only granted access
  needed for their specific job functions. By enforcing least privilege, this rule
  not only enhances security by preventing unauthorized data access but also aids
  in compliance with security standards and regulations, providing organizations with
  a robust security posture.
