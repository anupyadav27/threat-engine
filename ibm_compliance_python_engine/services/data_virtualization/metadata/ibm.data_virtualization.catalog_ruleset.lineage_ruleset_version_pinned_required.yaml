title: Enforce Lineage Ruleset Version Pinning for Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Pinning the version of lineage rulesets in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  is crucial to ensure consistent data governance and security. By locking the ruleset
  version, organizations can prevent unauthorized changes that might lead to data
  exposure or non-compliance with regulatory standards. This practice helps maintain
  the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether the lineage ruleset used within IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization's catalog is pinned to a specific version. Pinning a ruleset version
  ensures that the data governance policies remain consistent and predictable, minimizing
  risks associated with unexpected changes. By enforcing version pinning, organizations
  can enhance their data protection strategies, ensuring that encryption at rest policies
  are consistently applied and maintained. This approach supports compliance with
  industry standards and regulations, offering a robust framework for data protection
  and privacy.
