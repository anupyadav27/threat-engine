title: Ensure Lineage Classifier Definition Version is Pinned for Data Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Pinning the Lineage Classifier Definition Version ensures that consistent
  and vetted versions of classifiers are used, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes
  and maintaining data integrity. This practice mitigates potential security vulnerabilities
  that could arise from unintentional or malicious changes in classifier definitions,
  thus protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that the Lineage Classifier Definition Version is explicitly
  pinned within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By enforcing a pinned version,
  organizations can ensure that only approved versions of the lineage classifier are
  deployed, thus avoiding potential security issues due to unexpected updates. This
  practice enhances data protection and privacy by maintaining control over classifier
  updates, ensuring compliance with encryption at rest standards, and providing a
  clear audit trail for data governance purposes.
