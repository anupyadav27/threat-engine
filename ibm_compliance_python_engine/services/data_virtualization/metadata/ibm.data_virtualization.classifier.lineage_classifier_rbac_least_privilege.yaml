title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage Classifier RBAC in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in IBM
  Cloud Data Virtualization's Lineage Classifier is crucial to minimizing unauthorized
  access to sensitive data. By ensuring users have only the necessary permissions,
  organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, thereby protecting
  sensitive information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that RBAC policies for the Lineage Classifier in IBM
  Cloud Data Virtualization adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks
  that users and roles are granted only the permissions essential for their role,
  preventing the over-provisioning of access rights. By enforcing this principle,
  organizations can enhance their security posture, reduce the risk of credential
  misuse, and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. Implementing least privilege access is a proactive measure that safeguards
  against potential internal and external threats.
