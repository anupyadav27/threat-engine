title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Catalog RBAC in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) in the Datalake Catalog is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  data access and potential data breaches. By limiting permissions to only those necessary
  for users to perform their job functions, organizations can significantly reduce
  their attack surface and protect sensitive data, thereby ensuring compliance with
  industry standards and safeguarding their business reputation.
description: This rule ensures that RBAC configurations within the IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization service adhere to the principle of least privilege by auditing and
  restricting access permissions to the Datalake Catalog. It checks for excessive
  permissions and flags configurations where users or roles have more access than
  required. By enforcing this rule, organizations enhance their security posture by
  preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized data access, supporting compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, and promoting best practices in identity
  and access management.
