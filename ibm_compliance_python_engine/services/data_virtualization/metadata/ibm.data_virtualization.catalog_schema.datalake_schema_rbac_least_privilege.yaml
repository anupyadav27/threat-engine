title: Enforce Least Privilege on Datalake Schema RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  for datalake schemas minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. This principle ensures that users only have access to the resources necessary
  for their roles, thus reducing the attack surface and safeguarding sensitive data
  from misuse or leakage, which can have significant business and legal implications.
description: This rule verifies that access permissions to datalake schemas in IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service are configured according to the principle of
  least privilege. It checks that roles assigned to users or services do not exceed
  the necessary permissions required to perform their functions. By ensuring that
  access is appropriately restricted, the rule enhances overall security posture and
  aids in compliance with data protection regulations by preventing unauthorized data
  exposures and ensuring accountability in data access management.
