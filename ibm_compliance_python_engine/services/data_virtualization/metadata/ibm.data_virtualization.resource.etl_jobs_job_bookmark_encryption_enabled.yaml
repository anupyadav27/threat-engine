title: Ensure Encryption of ETL Job Bookmarks in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for ETL job bookmarks in IBM Data Virtualization is
  crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. Without encryption, job metadata, which
  might contain sensitive information, is at risk of unauthorized access and exposure,
  potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for ETL job bookmarks
  within the IBM Data Virtualization service. Ensuring that bookmarks are encrypted
  enhances data security by protecting job metadata from unauthorized access. This
  measure not only strengthens the overall security posture of your data operations
  but also aids in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  stringent data protection standards. By implementing encryption, you safeguard sensitive
  information, thereby reducing the risk of data leaks and enhancing trust with stakeholders.
