title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Lineage Rules
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) for data virtualization lineage rules minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This approach ensures that users have only the
  necessary permissions required to perform their job functions, reducing the attack
  surface and enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
description: This rule checks whether the permissions assigned to users and roles
  for accessing data virtualization lineage rules adhere to the least privilege principle.
  By ensuring that only authorized users with the minimal necessary rights can access
  and modify lineage rules, it protects sensitive data and maintains the integrity
  of data governance processes. Enforcing least privilege in RBAC aligns with compliance
  standards by preventing excessive permissions and securing critical data assets
  from unauthorized exposure.
