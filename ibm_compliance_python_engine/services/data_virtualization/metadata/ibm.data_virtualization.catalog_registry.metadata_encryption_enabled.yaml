rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_registry.metadata_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Metadata Encryption is Enabled for Data Virtualization Catalog
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling metadata encryption protects sensitive data descriptions and schema
  information within the Data Virtualization catalog. Without encryption, this metadata
  is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and non-compliance
  with data protection regulations. Ensuring encryption at rest for metadata is crucial
  for maintaining confidentiality and trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for metadata stored in
  the Data Virtualization catalog registry. By ensuring that metadata is encrypted
  at rest, organizations can protect against unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. This enhances the overall security posture by safeguarding sensitive information
  that could be exploited if exposed. Implementing encryption helps meet various compliance
  requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that personal and sensitive data
  is adequately protected.
