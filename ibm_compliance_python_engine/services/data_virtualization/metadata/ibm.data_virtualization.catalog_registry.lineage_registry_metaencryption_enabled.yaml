rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_registry.lineage_registry_metaencryption_enabled
title: Ensure Metaencryption for Lineage Registry in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling metaencryption for the Lineage Registry within IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service is crucial for safeguarding sensitive metadata against unauthorized
  access. This protection is vital for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with regulatory
  requirements. Failure to implement this encryption can lead to severe legal and
  financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks whether the Lineage Registry within the Data Virtualization
  service has metaencryption enabled, ensuring that metadata is encrypted at rest.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can protect metadata from unauthorized access
  and tampering, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and security. Enabling
  metaencryption aligns with best practices for data protection and privacy, and it
  helps organizations meet compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other industry
  regulations that mandate encryption of sensitive information.
