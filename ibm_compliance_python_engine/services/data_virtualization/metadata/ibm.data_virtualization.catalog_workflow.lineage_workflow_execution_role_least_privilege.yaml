title: Ensure Least Privilege for Lineage Workflow Execution in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for roles involved in lineage
  workflow execution is crucial to minimizing security risks such as data breaches
  or unauthorized access. It ensures that users or services have only the necessary
  permissions to perform their job functions, reducing the potential attack surface
  and safeguarding sensitive business data and intellectual property.
description: This rule assesses the permissions granted to roles executing lineage
  workflows within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. It ensures that these
  roles adhere to the principle of least privilege by verifying that they are assigned
  only the permissions essential for their specific tasks. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can enhance security by limiting access to critical workflows, aiding
  in compliance with industry standards such as GDPR or HIPAA, and reducing the likelihood
  of insider threats or accidental data exposure.
