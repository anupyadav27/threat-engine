title: Ensure Public Sharing is Disabled for Catalog Tables in Data Virtualization
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling public sharing on catalog tables within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. Allowing
  public sharing can lead to data breaches, resulting in compliance violations and
  significant business losses. Securing access ensures that only authenticated and
  authorized users can interact with critical data assets.
description: This rule verifies that public sharing is disabled for catalog tables
  in the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By ensuring public sharing is turned
  off, this rule enhances data security by limiting data exposure to authenticated
  users only, preventing unauthorized access. This practice aligns with best practices
  in identity and access management by enforcing strict access controls and supporting
  compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular audits of these
  settings help maintain a secure cloud environment, reducing the risk of data leakage
  and maintaining customer trust.
