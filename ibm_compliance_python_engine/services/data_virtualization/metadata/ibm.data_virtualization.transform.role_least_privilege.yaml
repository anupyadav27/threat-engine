title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Transform Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for transform roles in IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service is critical for minimizing security risks associated
  with unauthorized access. By ensuring that users and applications have only the
  necessary permissions, organizations can protect sensitive data from potential breaches
  and reduce the attack surface, ultimately safeguarding business integrity and compliance
  with regulatory standards.
description: This rule mandates the enforcement of least privilege for roles associated
  with transform operations in the Data Virtualization service. It checks that permissions
  granted to these roles are strictly necessary for their intended functions, thereby
  preventing excessive access rights that could be exploited by malicious actors.
  Adhering to this rule helps maintain a secure environment by limiting the potential
  exposure of sensitive information and aligning with compliance frameworks such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, which emphasize stringent access controls.
