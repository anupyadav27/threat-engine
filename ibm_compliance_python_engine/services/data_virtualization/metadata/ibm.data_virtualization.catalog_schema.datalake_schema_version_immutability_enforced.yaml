title: Ensure Immutability of Datalake Schema Versions in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing immutability of datalake schema versions is crucial to maintaining
  data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications. This measure helps protect
  against accidental or malicious alterations that could lead to data breaches or
  compliance violations, thus ensuring the reliability of data for business operations
  and decision-making processes.
description: This rule checks whether the immutability of datalake schema versions
  is enforced within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that schema
  versions cannot be altered once they are published, this rule enhances data integrity
  and security. It helps in maintaining a clear audit trail, which is essential for
  compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Enforcing schema immutability
  also supports data protection strategies by safeguarding against unauthorized access
  and changes, thereby reinforcing the organization's overall security posture.
