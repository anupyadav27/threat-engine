title: Ensure Encryption of Analytics Catalog Metadata in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for analytics catalog metadata is crucial to safeguarding
  sensitive information against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This
  practice ensures that critical business data remains secure both from external threats
  and internal misuse, thereby maintaining customer trust and meeting regulatory compliance
  requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption is enabled for metadata within
  the analytics catalog in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, the rule ensures that metadata stored in the catalog is protected from
  unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data exposure. This not only enhances
  the security posture of the organization but also aids in achieving compliance with
  industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection through
  encryption.
