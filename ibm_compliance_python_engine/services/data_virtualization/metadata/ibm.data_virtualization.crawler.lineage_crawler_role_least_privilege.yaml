title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Lineage Crawler Role
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that the Lineage Crawler role operates under the principle of
  least privilege is crucial to minimize potential attack surfaces and unauthorized
  data access. By restricting permissions to only those necessary for the crawler's
  function, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches and maintain compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions assigned to the Lineage Crawler role
  within IBM Cloud's data virtualization service. It checks whether the role is granted
  only the minimal set of privileges needed to perform its tasks, thereby preventing
  excessive access rights that could be exploited by malicious actors. Implementing
  least privilege access controls enhances security by limiting potential exposure
  of sensitive data and supports adherence to compliance frameworks such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personal and sensitive data.
