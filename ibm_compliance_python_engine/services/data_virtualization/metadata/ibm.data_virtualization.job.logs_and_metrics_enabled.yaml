rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.job.logs_and_metrics_enabled
title: Ensure Logs and Metrics are Enabled for Data Virtualization Jobs
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logs and metrics for data virtualization jobs is critical for
  maintaining comprehensive visibility into operations and potential security events.
  This practice aids in detecting unauthorized access attempts, performance issues,
  and ensures adherence to regulatory compliance by providing a detailed audit trail.
description: This security rule verifies that logging and metrics are enabled for
  all data virtualization jobs within IBM Cloud. By ensuring that these capabilities
  are active, organizations can monitor and analyze job execution details, detect
  anomalies, and gain insights into resource usage. This proactive approach enhances
  security posture by enabling prompt incident response and supports compliance with
  industry standards like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate thorough logging and monitoring
  of data activities.
