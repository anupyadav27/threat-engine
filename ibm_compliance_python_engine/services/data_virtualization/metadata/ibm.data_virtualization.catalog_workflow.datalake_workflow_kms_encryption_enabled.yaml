title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Datalake Workflow in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for datalake workflows
  is essential to safeguard sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This rule ensures that all data processed and stored within the catalog
  workflow is encrypted at rest, aligning with data protection and privacy standards,
  thus minimizing the risk of data exposure and ensuring regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for datalake workflows
  within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By ensuring encryption at rest, data
  is protected through advanced cryptographic methods, which prevent unauthorized
  users from accessing or reading the data without the necessary decryption keys.
  This practice not only enhances the overall security posture of the cloud environment
  but also aids in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other
  industry-specific regulations that mandate encryption of sensitive data.
