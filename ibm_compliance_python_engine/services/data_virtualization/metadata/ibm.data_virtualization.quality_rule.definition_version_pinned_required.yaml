title: Enforce Pinned Definition Version for Data Virtualization Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that the definition version in Data Virtualization is pinned is
  crucial for maintaining data integrity and security. Unpinned versions can lead
  to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities, as changes in definition can introduce
  untested or insecure configurations. This practice helps prevent unauthorized data
  access and supports compliance with data protection standards, which is vital for
  maintaining customer trust and avoiding regulatory penalties.
description: This rule verifies that the quality_rule resource within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service has its definition version explicitly pinned. By enforcing
  this, organizations can ensure that the data processing rules remain consistent
  and predictable over time, thereby reducing the risk of data leaks or unauthorized
  modifications. Pinned versions help organizations align with compliance frameworks
  that require strict version control and auditability of data processing rules. This
  rule enhances overall security by ensuring that only tested and approved versions
  are deployed, minimizing the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in newer, untested
  versions.
