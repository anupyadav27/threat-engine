title: Ensure Privacy Masking Policies for Sensitive Data in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing privacy masking policies for sensitive fields is crucial to
  protect personally identifiable information (PII) and comply with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Without these policies, sensitive information
  may be exposed, leading to potential data breaches, legal penalties, and loss of
  customer trust.
description: This rule verifies the presence of privacy masking policies for sensitive
  fields within the IBM Data Virtualization service. By enforcing these policies,
  organizations can ensure that sensitive data is obfuscated, making it inaccessible
  to unauthorized users. This not only enhances data confidentiality and integrity
  but also helps in maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations
  concerning data protection and privacy. Implementing privacy masking reduces the
  risk of data leakage and supports secure data handling practices across the enterprise.
