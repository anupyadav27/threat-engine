title: Ensure Private and Encrypted Script Location for Data Virtualization Jobs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that job scripts within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service
  are stored in a private and encrypted manner is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access. This practice mitigates the risk of data breaches
  and aligns with compliance mandates, safeguarding both the integrity of business
  operations and the trust of stakeholders.
description: This rule checks whether the storage location of scripts used in Data
  Virtualization jobs is both private and encrypted. By enforcing encryption at rest,
  sensitive information within the scripts is protected from unauthorized access and
  potential data exposure. Implementing this rule enhances overall security posture
  by ensuring that all data handled by job scripts meets stringent data protection
  standards, supporting compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Moreover,
  it prevents unauthorized users from accessing or modifying critical scripts, thereby
  maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data processing tasks.
