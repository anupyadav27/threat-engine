title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Catalog Workflow Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for execution roles within IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service is critical to minimizing potential security risks. Over-privileged
  roles can lead to unauthorized access or unintentional data exposure, which can
  result in compliance violations and financial repercussions. By enforcing least
  privilege principles, organizations can better protect sensitive data and enhance
  overall security posture.
description: This rule checks that execution roles associated with the Data Virtualization
  catalog workflow are configured with the minimum permissions necessary to perform
  their functions. By restricting permissions, this rule reduces the attack surface
  and limits potential damage from compromised credentials. Adhering to the principle
  of least privilege aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements,
  thereby enhancing compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
