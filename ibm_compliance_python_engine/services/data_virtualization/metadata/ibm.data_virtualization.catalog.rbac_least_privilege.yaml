title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Catalog
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the RBAC least privilege principle ensures that users have
  only the permissions necessary to perform their job duties, reducing the risk of
  unauthorized data access. By limiting permissions, organizations can mitigate the
  potential impact of insider threats and accidental data breaches, thus safeguarding
  sensitive business information and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations
  for IBM Cloud Data Virtualization catalogs adhere to the least privilege principle.
  It checks whether user roles are assigned with the minimal permissions required
  for their tasks, thereby reducing unnecessary access to sensitive data. Enforcing
  this rule enhances security by minimizing potential attack vectors and aligns with
  best practices for compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict
  access control measures to protect personal and sensitive data.
