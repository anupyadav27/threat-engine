title: Ensure Lineage Database Encryption in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the lineage database in IBM Data Virtualization is crucial for
  protecting sensitive metadata describing how data flows across systems. This encryption
  at rest mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead
  to significant financial losses and reputational damage. Furthermore, it ensures
  compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards, safeguarding
  the organization against potential legal penalties.
description: This rule verifies that the lineage database used in IBM Data Virtualization
  is encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest secures stored data by rendering it unreadable
  without the proper decryption keys, thereby protecting it from unauthorized access
  and malicious threats. By ensuring this encryption, organizations enhance their
  security posture by safeguarding critical metadata and aligning with compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this rule helps maintain data
  confidentiality and integrity, essential for building trust with stakeholders and
  customers.
