rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_table.lineage_table_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Data Virtualization Lineage Tables
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting lineage tables is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality
  and integrity of sensitive metadata within the IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring
  these tables are encrypted at rest, organizations can protect against unauthorized
  access and data breaches, which helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations
  and instills confidence among stakeholders regarding data privacy.
description: This rule verifies that lineage tables within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  service are encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest ensures that the data is unreadable
  without the appropriate decryption keys, thereby safeguarding it from unauthorized
  access and potential breaches. Implementing this rule enhances the security posture
  by mitigating risks associated with data exposure and aligns with industry standards
  for data protection and privacy. Additionally, it supports compliance with regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures.
