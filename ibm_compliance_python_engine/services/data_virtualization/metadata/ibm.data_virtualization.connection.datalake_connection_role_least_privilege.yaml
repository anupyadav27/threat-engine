rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.connection.datalake_connection_role_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Connection Roles in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that datalake connection roles adhere to the principle of least
  privilege is crucial for minimizing security risks. By restricting access to only
  the necessary resources, organizations can significantly reduce the attack surface
  and prevent unauthorized data access which could lead to data breaches, compliance
  violations, and financial loss.
description: This rule checks for least privilege adherence in datalake connection
  roles within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service by ensuring that roles only
  have the necessary permissions to perform their specific functions. Implementing
  this rule helps to enhance security by limiting potential exploitation and maintaining
  strict access controls. Compliance with this rule also supports adherence to regulatory
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which emphasize the protection of sensitive data
  through stringent access management practices.
