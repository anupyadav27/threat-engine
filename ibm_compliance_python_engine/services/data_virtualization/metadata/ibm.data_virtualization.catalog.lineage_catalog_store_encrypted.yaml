title: Ensure Encryption of Lineage Catalog Store in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the Lineage Catalog Store is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  metadata, preventing unauthorized data access, and maintaining data integrity. Encryption
  at rest protects against data breaches and ensures compliance with data protection
  regulations, minimizing the risk of financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that the Lineage Catalog Store within IBM Data Virtualization
  is encrypted at rest, ensuring that all metadata and lineage information is securely
  stored. Encryption enhances data security by converting data into a coded format
  that can only be decoded with the appropriate decryption key. By ensuring encryption,
  organizations can meet data protection standards and regulatory requirements, such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby enhancing their overall security posture and trustworthiness.
