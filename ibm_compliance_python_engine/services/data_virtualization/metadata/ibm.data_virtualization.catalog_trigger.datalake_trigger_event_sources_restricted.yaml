title: Restrict Event Sources for Datalake Triggers in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Limiting event sources for datalake triggers is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. By ensuring that only approved and necessary
  data sources can trigger events, organizations can safeguard sensitive information
  and maintain compliance with data protection regulations. This restriction helps
  mitigate risks associated with unmonitored data flow and ensures that only legitimate
  processes can initiate data operations.
description: This security rule ensures that event sources for datalake triggers within
  IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service are restricted to pre-approved, vetted sources.
  By enforcing strict access controls and limiting event source permissions, organizations
  can enhance their data protection measures. This not only reduces the attack surface
  but also aligns with encryption at rest policies, ensuring that data remains secure
  and compliant with industry standards. Implementing this rule aids in maintaining
  a robust security posture by minimizing unauthorized data operations and enhancing
  overall data governance.
