title: Enforce Least Privilege for Datalake Quality Role in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for the Datalake Quality
  Role is crucial in minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. By ensuring that users and systems have only the access necessary to perform
  their tasks, organizations can reduce the attack surface and enhance the overall
  security posture of their data assets, thereby protecting sensitive information
  and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule checks that the Datalake Quality Role within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service is configured with the least privilege necessary to
  perform its designated functions. By auditing permissions and restricting access
  rights, the rule helps to prevent excessive privileges which could lead to data
  exposure or misuse. Enforcing least privilege in data virtualization not only aligns
  with best practices in identity and access management but also aids in achieving
  compliance with industry regulations and standards. This proactive measure supports
  the protection of data integrity and confidentiality while maintaining efficient
  operational workflows.
