title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Lineage Catalog
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for the Lineage Catalog in IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service is essential to minimize unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By ensuring that users and applications only have the permissions
  necessary to perform their tasks, organizations can significantly reduce the risk
  of malicious insiders or attackers exploiting excessive privileges, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive data and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks that access permissions to the Lineage Catalog within
  IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It ensures that users and roles are assigned only the necessary permissions required
  for their specific functions. By enforcing this security control, organizations
  can limit exposure to sensitive data, reduce the attack surface, and align with
  best practices for identity and access management. This approach not only strengthens
  security posture but also aids in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA by ensuring that access to data is carefully controlled and monitored.
