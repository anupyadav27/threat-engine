title: Enforce Least Privilege on Lineage Partition Access in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for lineage partitions in IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization is crucial for minimizing security risks and protecting sensitive
  data. This rule ensures that only authorized users and applications have the necessary
  access to perform their functions, reducing the attack surface and potential insider
  threats. By adhering to this principle, organizations can prevent unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule evaluates the access policies associated with lineage partitions
  in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization to ensure they adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. It checks that permissions granted to users and applications are limited
  to those strictly necessary for their roles. By enforcing least privilege, this
  rule enhances security by minimizing pathways for unauthorized access and potential
  misuse of sensitive data. Furthermore, it supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulatory mandates by providing robust access control measures and detailed
  audit trails.
