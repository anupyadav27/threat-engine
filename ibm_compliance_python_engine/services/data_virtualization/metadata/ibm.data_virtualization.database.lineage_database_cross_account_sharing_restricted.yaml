title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing for Lineage Databases in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of lineage databases is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and data leakage. Uncontrolled sharing can lead to exposure
  of sensitive data and potential breaches, affecting business integrity and compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule ensures that lineage databases within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  service are not shared across different accounts, which could otherwise lead to
  unauthorized data access and potential security vulnerabilities. By enforcing restrictions
  on cross-account sharing, organizations can maintain stronger data protection and
  privacy controls, aligning with encryption at rest policies. This practice enhances
  the security posture by limiting data exposure and assists in meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
