title: Ensure Encryption for Datalake Dev Endpoint in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is crucial to protect sensitive information from
  unauthorized access and breaches. In a development environment, where data is frequently
  tested and manipulated, encryption ensures that even if data is accessed by malicious
  actors, it remains unreadable and secure. This practice not only mitigates the risk
  of data theft but also aligns with industry standards and compliance requirements,
  safeguarding the organization's reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all data residing in the Datalake development
  endpoint is encrypted using robust encryption algorithms. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, the rule ensures that all data stored within the Datalake is automatically
  encrypted, thereby preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This
  enhances the overall security posture of the cloud environment, ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this rule
  helps organizations mitigate risks, reduce potential fines, and maintain the integrity
  and confidentiality of their data assets.
