title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Virtualization ML Transform Role
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in the Data Virtualization
  service is crucial to minimize security risks and prevent unauthorized access to
  sensitive data. By ensuring that the Datalake ML Transform Role has only the permissions
  necessary to perform its function, organizations can reduce the attack surface and
  mitigate the potential for data breaches, thus protecting business-critical information
  and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks that the Datalake ML Transform Role within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service is configured with the least privilege necessary to
  perform its intended operations. By restricting permissions to only those essential
  for the role's functionality, this rule helps to enforce robust access controls,
  thereby improving the overall security posture of the cloud environment. Adhering
  to this principle supports compliance with industry standards and regulations, such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access controls to safeguard data privacy
  and integrity.
