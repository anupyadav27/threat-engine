title: Enforce TLS for Secure Datalake Connections in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing TLS for datalake connections is crucial to safeguard data in
  transit against interception and unauthorized access. Ensuring encrypted communication
  helps protect sensitive information, maintain data integrity, and comply with privacy
  regulations, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing trust with
  stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that all connections to datalake resources within
  IBM Data Virtualization services are configured to use Transport Layer Security
  (TLS). By mandating TLS, the rule ensures that data transmitted between clients
  and the datalake remains encrypted, preventing potential eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This security measure not only fortifies data protection but also aids
  in achieving compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  require the protection of data in transit. Implementing TLS thus bolsters the overall
  security posture and helps organizations meet their data protection obligations.
