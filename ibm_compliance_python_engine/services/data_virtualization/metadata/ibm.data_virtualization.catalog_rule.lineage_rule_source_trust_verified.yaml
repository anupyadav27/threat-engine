title: Ensure Trust Verification for Lineage Rule Source in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Verifying the trustworthiness of lineage rule sources within IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security.
  Untrusted sources can introduce vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized data access
  or manipulation, which can compromise sensitive business information and lead to
  regulatory non-compliance.
description: This rule ensures that all lineage rule sources in the Data Virtualization
  catalog are verified for trust. By implementing checks to authenticate and validate
  these sources, we prevent malicious or unauthorized entities from influencing data
  lineage. This enhances the security posture by protecting data integrity, ensuring
  that only authorized entities can define data relationships. Compliance with this
  rule helps organizations adhere to data protection regulations and industry standards,
  offering assurance to stakeholders about the reliability and security of their data
  management processes.
