rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.connection.credentials_in_secrets_manager
title: Secure Data Virtualization Connections with Secrets Manager
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Storing credentials in IBM Cloud Secrets Manager enhances the security
  of data virtualization connections by safeguarding sensitive information through
  robust encryption and access controls. This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, ensuring compliance with industry standards
  and protecting business-critical operations.
description: This security rule checks whether credentials for data virtualization
  connections are stored in IBM Cloud Secrets Manager. By leveraging Secrets Manager,
  organizations benefit from centralized management of sensitive data, automatic rotation,
  and fine-grained access controls, which collectively fortify the security posture.
  Implementing this rule not only reduces the attack surface by preventing hardcoded
  credentials but also aids in adhering to compliance frameworks such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which demand stringent data protection measures.
