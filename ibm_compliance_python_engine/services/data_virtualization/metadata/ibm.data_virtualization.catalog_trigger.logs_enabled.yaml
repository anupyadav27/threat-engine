rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_trigger.logs_enabled
title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization Catalog Triggers
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Data Virtualization catalog triggers is crucial
  for maintaining a comprehensive security posture. This ensures that all operations
  and changes are recorded, providing traceability and accountability, which are vital
  for detecting unauthorized actions and supporting forensic investigations. Additionally,
  it helps organizations meet compliance requirements by demonstrating effective monitoring
  and control of data access and operations.
description: This security rule verifies that audit logging is activated for catalog
  triggers within IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By enabling audit logs,
  organizations can capture detailed records of trigger activities, ensuring that
  any alterations or invocations are documented. This practice not only enhances security
  by providing a mechanism to identify and respond to suspicious activities but also
  supports compliance with regulations that mandate audit trails. Moreover, comprehensive
  logging facilitates proactive monitoring and can be integrated with alerting systems
  to notify security teams of potential issues in real-time.
