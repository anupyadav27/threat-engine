title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Quality Ruleset
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege ensures that users only have
  access to the resources necessary for their roles, minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This approach is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and confidentiality, thereby safeguarding business operations and compliance
  with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that access permissions for the Data Virtualization
  Quality Ruleset adhere to the least privilege principle by ensuring that roles and
  permissions are appropriately assigned and limited. By restricting access rights
  to the minimum level necessary, this rule reduces the attack surface and potential
  for misuse of sensitive data. It enhances security posture by preventing excessive
  permissions that could lead to unauthorized data exposure or modification, supporting
  compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
