title: Ensure Encryption for Data Catalogs Connections in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for Data Catalogs connections within IBM Cloud is crucial
  to safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining data confidentiality. Without
  encryption, data in transit and at rest is vulnerable to unauthorized access and
  potential breaches, which can lead to significant financial and reputational damage
  for businesses. Ensuring encryption not only protects data integrity but also helps
  organizations comply with regulatory requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that data catalogs connections within the
  IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service have encryption enabled, specifically focusing
  on password and database encryption. By enforcing encryption, the rule ensures that
  sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and exposure, both in transit
  and at rest. This practice enhances the security posture by mitigating risks associated
  with data breaches and aligns with compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and
  PCI DSS, which mandate encryption for data protection.
