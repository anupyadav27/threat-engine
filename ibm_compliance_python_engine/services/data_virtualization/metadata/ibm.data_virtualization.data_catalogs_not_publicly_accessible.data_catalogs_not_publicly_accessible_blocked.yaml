title: Ensure Data Catalogs Are Not Publicly Accessible in IBM Cloud
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Protecting data catalogs from public access is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access to sensitive data and intellectual property. Publicly accessible data catalogs
  can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and significant financial and
  reputational damage to the organization. This rule is critical to maintaining the
  confidentiality and integrity of data managed within the IBM Cloud.
description: This security rule verifies that data catalogs within the IBM Cloud's
  Data Virtualization service are configured to prevent public accessibility. By enforcing
  this rule, organizations can ensure that their data catalogs are only accessible
  to authorized users, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This practice aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  for data protection and privacy, enhancing the overall security posture of the cloud
  environment. Additionally, it enables organizations to maintain compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict controls over data access
  and sharing.
