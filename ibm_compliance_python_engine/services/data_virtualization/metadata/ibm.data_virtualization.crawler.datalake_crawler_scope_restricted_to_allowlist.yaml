title: Restrict Datalake Crawler Scope to Authorized Allowlist Only
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting the datalake crawler scope to an authorized allowlist ensures
  that only predefined and trusted data sources are accessed, mitigating the risk
  of unauthorized data exposure and potential breaches. This rule is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and privacy, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized
  access, and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether the datalake crawler in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service is configured to operate within an approved allowlist of data sources. By
  limiting the crawler's scope to an allowlist, organizations can prevent unauthorized
  data access and ensure that only vetted datasets are processed. This enhances overall
  security by reducing the attack surface, and it helps in meeting compliance requirements
  related to data protection and privacy by ensuring that sensitive data is handled
  only within the bounds of predefined security policies.
