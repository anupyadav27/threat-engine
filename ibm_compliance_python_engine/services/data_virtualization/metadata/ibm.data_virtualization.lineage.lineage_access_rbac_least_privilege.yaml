title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Lineage in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for lineage data access in
  IBM Data Virtualization is crucial to ensure that users only have access to the
  data necessary for their roles. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive business insights and maintaining
  compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings for
  data lineage in IBM Data Virtualization are configured to enforce the least privilege
  principle. It checks whether user access permissions are restricted to the minimal
  level required for their job functions, reducing the risk of excessive data exposure.
  By ensuring appropriate authorization configurations, organizations can enhance
  their security posture, mitigate potential insider threats, and align with regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
