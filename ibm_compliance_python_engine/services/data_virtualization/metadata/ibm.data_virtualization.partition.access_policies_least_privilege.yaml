title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Partition Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access policies is crucial for minimizing
  potential security breaches and unauthorized data exposure within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that access rights are restricted to only
  what is necessary for users to perform their tasks, organizations can reduce the
  risk of insider threats and protect sensitive data, thereby maintaining trust and
  compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether access policies for IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  partitions adhere to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that permissions
  are granted based on the minimum necessary access required for users to perform
  their job functions, effectively reducing the attack surface and mitigating risks
  of unauthorized data access. By aligning with compliance standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, this rule enhances the overall security posture and aids in achieving
  regulatory compliance through precise access management.
