title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for Data Virtualization Catalog Workflow
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for data virtualization
  catalog workflows secures sensitive data by encrypting it at rest. This reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations, ensuring
  that organizational data integrity and confidentiality are maintained.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for the catalog workflows
  within IBM Cloud's data virtualization service. By enforcing encryption at rest,
  it ensures that all stored data is protected using cryptographic techniques, significantly
  enhancing data security. This practice aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements, offering compliance benefits and mitigating potential legal and financial
  risks associated with unencrypted data storage.
