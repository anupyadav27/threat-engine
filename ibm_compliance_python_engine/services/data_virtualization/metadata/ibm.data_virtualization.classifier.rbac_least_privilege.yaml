title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Classifiers
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) ensures that users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform
  their job functions. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or accidental
  modification of sensitive data, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality
  of the data within the organization.
description: This rule checks that access permissions for data virtualization classifiers
  are appropriately restricted according to the principle of least privilege. By ensuring
  that roles and permissions are tightly controlled, organizations can mitigate the
  risks associated with excessive authorization, such as data breaches and insider
  threats. This enhances the security posture by ensuring that users have only the
  access they need, aligning with best practices and compliance regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA.
