rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog_trigger.datalake_trigger_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Datalake Trigger Logs are Enabled for Audit and Compliance
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for datalake triggers is crucial for maintaining a secure
  and compliant environment. It allows for the monitoring of data access and manipulation
  activities, which is vital for detecting unauthorized actions and ensuring accountability.
  This practice helps in protecting sensitive data and supports compliance with regulatory
  requirements by providing a traceable record of activities.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for all datalake triggers
  within the IBM Cloud data virtualization service. By ensuring that logging is active,
  organizations can capture detailed information on trigger executions, which aids
  in forensic investigations and enhances visibility into data operations. This not
  only strengthens the security posture by enabling early detection of anomalies but
  also facilitates adherence to industry standards and regulatory frameworks that
  mandate audit logging.
