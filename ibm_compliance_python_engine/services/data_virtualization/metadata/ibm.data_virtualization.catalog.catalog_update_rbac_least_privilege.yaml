title: Enforce Least Privilege for Catalog Updates in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for catalog updates in IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service is essential to minimize the risk of unauthorized
  data access or modification. By restricting permissions to only those necessary
  for users to perform their roles, organizations can significantly reduce the attack
  surface and mitigate potential insider threats, ensuring data integrity and compliance
  with security standards.
description: This rule checks whether the role-based access control (RBAC) for updating
  catalogs in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization is configured to follow the least privilege
  principle. It ensures that only users with explicit business needs have permissions
  to update catalog configurations, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious changes.
  Enforcing least privilege supports regulatory compliance by aligning with best practices
  for access management and contributes to the overall security posture by limiting
  potential exposure to vulnerabilities.
