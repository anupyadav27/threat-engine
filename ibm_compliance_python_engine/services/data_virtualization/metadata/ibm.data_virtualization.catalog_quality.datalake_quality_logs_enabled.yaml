title: Ensure Datalake Quality Logs are Enabled in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Datalake Quality Logs in IBM Data Virtualization is crucial for
  maintaining transparency and accountability in data management processes. By capturing
  detailed logs, organizations can monitor data quality operations, detect anomalies,
  and respond promptly to potential security threats, thereby reducing the risk of
  data breaches and ensuring data integrity.
description: This rule verifies that Datalake Quality Logs are enabled within the
  IBM Data Virtualization service. It ensures that all data operations, transformations,
  and quality assessments are systematically recorded, providing a comprehensive audit
  trail. Enabling these logs enhances security posture by allowing for continuous
  monitoring and facilitates compliance with regulatory standards by providing evidence
  of data governance practices. This proactive measure supports efficient incident
  response and forensic analysis by ensuring that detailed logs are readily available.
