title: Enforce Least Privilege in Admin RBAC for Data Virtualization
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for admin roles in data virtualization
  is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. By granting
  only the necessary permissions to administrators, organizations can protect sensitive
  data and maintain regulatory compliance, thereby reducing potential business and
  legal repercussions.
description: This rule ensures that admin roles in the data virtualization governance
  policy are configured with the least privilege necessary to perform their duties.
  It checks for overly permissive access rights that exceed the required scope for
  administrative tasks, thereby enhancing security by limiting potential attack vectors.
  By adhering to this rule, organizations can achieve better compliance with industry
  standards and regulations, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality.
