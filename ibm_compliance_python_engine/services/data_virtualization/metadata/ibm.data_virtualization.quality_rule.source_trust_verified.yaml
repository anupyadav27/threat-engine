title: Ensure Source Trust Verification for Data Virtualization Quality Rules
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Verifying the trustworthiness of data sources is crucial to maintaining
  data integrity and preventing unauthorized access, which can lead to significant
  security breaches and compliance failures. Ensuring that all data sources are verified
  mitigates risks associated with data manipulation, ensuring that business decisions
  are based on accurate and reliable information.
description: This rule checks that all data sources integrated within IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization are verified for trustworthiness. By implementing source trust verification,
  organizations can ensure that data at rest is encrypted and sourced from authenticated
  origins, significantly reducing the risk of data tampering and unauthorized access.
  This practice not only strengthens data protection and privacy but also helps in
  maintaining compliance with data security standards and regulations, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
