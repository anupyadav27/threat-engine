title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage Trigger Targets in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that Lineage Trigger Targets operate under the principle of least
  privilege is critical to minimizing potential attack vectors within the IBM Cloud
  environment. By restricting access to only the necessary permissions, organizations
  can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive information and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Lineage Trigger Targets in IBM Data Virtualization
  are configured with the least privilege necessary for their function. It checks
  for excessive permissions that may expose the system to unauthorized actions or
  data access. Implementing this rule enhances security by ensuring that only authorized
  identities can access specific resources, which helps in maintaining a secure and
  compliant cloud environment. Adhering to this principle not only aligns with best
  practices for identity and access management but also aids in meeting stringent
  compliance standards.
