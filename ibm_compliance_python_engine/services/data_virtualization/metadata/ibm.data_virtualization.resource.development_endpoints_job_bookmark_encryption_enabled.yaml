rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.resource.development_endpoints_job_bookmark_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption for Development Endpoints Job Bookmarks in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for development endpoints job bookmarks is crucial
  to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without
  encryption, data is vulnerable to exposure during storage and transmission, which
  can lead to significant business risks including data theft, regulatory non-compliance,
  and damage to reputation.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for job bookmarks within
  the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service's development endpoints. Enforcing encryption
  at rest for job bookmarks ensures that any metadata associated with data processing
  jobs is securely stored, thereby mitigating the risk of data leakage. By adhering
  to this requirement, organizations enhance their overall security posture and align
  with compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA that mandate data protection measures.
