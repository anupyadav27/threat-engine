title: Ensure Encryption of Privacy Rights Workflow Storage in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting privacy rights workflow storage is essential to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This encryption helps organizations
  comply with data protection and privacy regulations, safeguarding customer trust
  and avoiding significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule ensures that all stored data associated with privacy rights
  workflows within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service is encrypted at rest.
  By verifying the use of encryption, the rule mitigates risks associated with data
  exposure and unauthorized access. Enforcing encryption at rest is a critical security
  measure that enhances data protection, aligns with industry best practices, and
  assists in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.
