rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.governance_quality.logs_enabled
title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization Governance
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for data virtualization governance quality is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and compliant IBM Cloud environment. Logs provide a detailed
  account of user activities, aiding in the detection of unauthorized access and ensuring
  compliance with regulatory requirements. This proactive measure helps mitigate potential
  security incidents and supports forensic investigations when necessary.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for the governance
  quality component of IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that logs
  are active, organizations can track and monitor all access and changes to the data
  virtualization environment, enhancing visibility and control over data operations.
  Enabling logging not only strengthens security by detecting anomalous behavior but
  also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards like GDPR and HIPAA by
  providing a comprehensive audit trail.
