title: Ensure TLS is Enabled for Lineage Connections in Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing TLS for lineage connections in IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  is crucial to protect sensitive data as it traverses the network. Unencrypted connections
  can expose data to interception and unauthorized access, potentially leading to
  data breaches and compliance violations. By mandating TLS, organizations can safeguard
  data integrity and confidentiality, aligning with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that all lineage connections within IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization employ TLS encryption. By ensuring that TLS is enabled, the
  rule enhances the security posture by protecting data in transit from eavesdropping
  and man-in-the-middle attacks. Adhering to this rule not only strengthens data protection
  but also supports compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and PCI
  DSS. This proactive security measure helps mitigate risks associated with unprotected
  data transfers, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and private.
