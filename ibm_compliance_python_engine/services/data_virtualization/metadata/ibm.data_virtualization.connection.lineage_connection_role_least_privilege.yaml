title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage Connection Roles in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege principles for lineage connection roles in
  IBM Cloud Data Virtualization is crucial to minimize the attack surface and reduce
  potential security risks. By ensuring that roles are only granted the permissions
  necessary for their function, organizations can protect sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and mitigate the risk of data breaches, which could lead to financial loss
  and legal implications.
description: This rule checks that lineage connection roles within IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service adhere to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that
  every role is assigned only the permissions essential for its required tasks, thereby
  reducing the risk of excessive privilege exploitation. Enforcing this rule enhances
  security by limiting the potential for unauthorized access and data exposure. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate strict
  access controls, thereby helping organizations to maintain a robust security posture
  and avoid penalties.
