title: Enforce Private Networking for Data Virtualization Jobs
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that data virtualization jobs operate over private networks significantly
  mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. By restricting network
  access to private channels, sensitive data is protected from exposure to the public
  internet, thus preserving data integrity and confidentiality. This approach not
  only strengthens security but also aligns with best practices and compliance requirements
  for network security.
description: This security rule checks whether data virtualization jobs are configured
  to enforce private network connectivity. By mandating the use of private networking,
  the rule ensures that jobs are executed within secure, isolated environments, minimizing
  exposure to potential threats. Implementing private networking reduces attack surfaces
  and fulfills compliance mandates by preventing unauthorized access to data processing
  resources. This rule is a key component in maintaining robust network security and
  ensuring that data virtualization operations comply with regulatory standards.
