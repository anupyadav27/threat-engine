title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Quality Rule Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in access control ensures
  that users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
  This minimizes risks associated with unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  which can lead to significant financial losses and damage to an organization’s reputation.
  By restricting access, organizations can also ensure compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that access to quality recommendations in the Data
  Virtualization service is governed by role-based access control (RBAC) principles,
  adhering to the least privilege model. It checks that users are assigned the minimum
  necessary permissions to perform their specific roles while preventing excessive
  access to sensitive resources. Implementing this rule enhances security by reducing
  the attack surface and aids in achieving compliance with data protection regulations
  by ensuring that access is appropriately restricted and monitored.
