title: Enforce Least Privilege on Data Virtualization Privacy Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for privacy execution roles in data virtualization
  is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. By limiting
  access rights to only those necessary for task execution, organizations can reduce
  their exposure to potential security threats and ensure compliance with data protection
  regulations. This helps maintain the integrity of sensitive data and supports organizational
  trust and compliance initiatives.
description: This rule evaluates the assignment of roles and privileges within IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service to ensure that privacy execution roles are configured
  with the minimum necessary permissions. By continuously monitoring and auditing
  role assignments, this rule helps identify and remediate any excessive permissions
  that could lead to unauthorized data access. Enforcing least privilege principles
  enhances security posture by protecting sensitive information and supports compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
