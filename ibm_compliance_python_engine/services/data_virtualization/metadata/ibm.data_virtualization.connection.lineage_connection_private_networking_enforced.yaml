title: Enforce Private Networking for Data Virtualization Lineage Connections
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for lineage connections in IBM Cloud's Data
  Virtualization service is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
  and potential breaches. By ensuring that these connections occur within a private
  network, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with exposure to the public
  internet, thereby enhancing data confidentiality and integrity. This practice not
  only safeguards critical business information but also aligns with compliance standards
  that demand stringent network access controls.
description: This rule verifies that all lineage connections within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service are configured to utilize private networking. By enforcing
  this configuration, the rule ensures that data exchanges are restricted to a secure,
  internal network, thereby reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  external access. Implementing private networking enhances the overall security posture
  by isolating sensitive data flows from public exposure, supporting compliance with
  industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA that require robust network security
  measures.
