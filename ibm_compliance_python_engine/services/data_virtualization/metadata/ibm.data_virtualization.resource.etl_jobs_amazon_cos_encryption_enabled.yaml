title: Enforce Encryption for ETL Jobs Using Amazon COS in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for ETL jobs utilizing Amazon Cloud Object Storage
  (COS) within IBM Data Virtualization is critical to safeguarding sensitive data.
  Encryption at rest ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. Failure to encrypt data can lead to non-compliance with data protection
  regulations, resulting in financial penalties and damage to an organization's reputation.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for ETL jobs interfacing
  with Amazon COS within IBM Data Virtualization environments. By ensuring that all
  data at rest is encrypted, organizations can better protect against unauthorized
  data exposure and maintain data integrity. Implementing this rule helps organizations
  comply with industry standards and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, which
  mandate encryption to protect sensitive data. This proactive measure enhances the
  overall security posture by reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  access.
