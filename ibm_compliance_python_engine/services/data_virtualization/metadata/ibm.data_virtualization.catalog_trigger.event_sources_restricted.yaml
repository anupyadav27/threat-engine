title: Restrict Event Sources for Data Virtualization Catalog Triggers
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting event sources for data virtualization catalog triggers is crucial
  for minimizing the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
  By ensuring that only approved and secure event sources are permitted, organizations
  can maintain control over sensitive data flows, thereby aligning with data protection
  regulations and safeguarding business-critical information.
description: This rule checks for the configuration of catalog triggers within IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service to ensure that event sources are strictly restricted
  to authorized entities. By enforcing this restriction, the rule enhances the security
  posture by preventing unauthorized or untrusted sources from triggering data processes
  that could expose sensitive information. This practice not only strengthens data
  protection by ensuring encryption at rest but also supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA.
