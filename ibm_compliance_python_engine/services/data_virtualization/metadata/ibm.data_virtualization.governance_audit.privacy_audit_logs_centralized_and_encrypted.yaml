title: Centralized and Encrypted Privacy Audit Logs for Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Centralizing and encrypting privacy audit logs is crucial for maintaining
  data confidentiality and integrity, ensuring that sensitive information is protected
  from unauthorized access and tampering. This practice is vital for meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements and minimizing the risk of data breaches, which can lead
  to significant financial penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that privacy audit logs within the IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization service are both centralized and encrypted. By ensuring logs are
  stored in a centralized location, organizations can simplify monitoring and analysis,
  facilitating quicker incident response. Encryption at rest further protects these
  logs from unauthorized access, safeguarding sensitive data as required by various
  compliance frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Adhering to this policy
  enhances the security posture by ensuring that audit trails remain confidential
  and tamper-proof.
