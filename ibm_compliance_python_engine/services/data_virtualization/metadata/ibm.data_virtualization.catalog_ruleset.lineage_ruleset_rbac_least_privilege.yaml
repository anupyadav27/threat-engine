title: Enforce Least Privilege for Lineage Ruleset RBAC in Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that Lineage Ruleset Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) adheres
  to the least privilege principle is crucial for minimizing potential security risks.
  By granting users only the permissions necessary for their roles, the risk of unauthorized
  access and accidental data exposure is significantly reduced, thereby protecting
  sensitive business information and maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule evaluates the RBAC settings associated with the Lineage Ruleset
  in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization service to ensure compliance with the least privilege
  principle. It checks that users and service accounts have only the necessary permissions
  to perform their tasks, reducing the attack surface for potential breaches. Implementing
  least privilege access enhances the security posture by limiting access to sensitive
  data and functions, helping organizations meet regulatory requirements and industry
  best practices for data protection and access management.
