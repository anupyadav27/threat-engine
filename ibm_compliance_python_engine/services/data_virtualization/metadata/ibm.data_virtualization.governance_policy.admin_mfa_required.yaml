title: Enforce MFA for Admin Access to Data Virtualization Governance Policies
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for administrators
  accessing data virtualization governance policies is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data. Without MFA, unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, compromising
  the integrity and confidentiality of business-critical information and potentially
  leading to substantial financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required
  for all admin users accessing governance policies within IBM Cloud's data virtualization
  service. By enforcing MFA, the rule strengthens the authentication process, making
  it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access. Implementing
  MFA is not only a best practice for enhancing security but also aligns with compliance
  standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate robust protection mechanisms for
  data access.
