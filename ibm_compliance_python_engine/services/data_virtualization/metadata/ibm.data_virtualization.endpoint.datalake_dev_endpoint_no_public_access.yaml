rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.endpoint.datalake_dev_endpoint_no_public_access
title: Restrict Public Access to Datalake Development Endpoints
severity: critical
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Datalake development endpoints do not have public access
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized data exposure and mitigate potential external
  threats. Publicly accessible endpoints can be exploited by malicious actors to gain
  unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
  Limiting access to trusted internal networks protects the integrity and confidentiality
  of the data, safeguarding the organization's reputation and maintaining regulatory
  compliance.
description: This rule checks that Datalake development endpoints in the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service are not accessible from the public internet. By enforcing
  this rule, organizations can ensure that only authenticated and authorized users
  within the internal network can access these endpoints, thereby reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access and data leaks. Implementing strict network access controls
  aligns with best practices in network security, enhances the overall security posture,
  and supports compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
