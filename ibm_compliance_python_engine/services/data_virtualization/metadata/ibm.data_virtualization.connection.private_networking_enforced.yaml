title: Enforce Private Networking for Secure Data Virtualization Connections
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for data virtualization connections is crucial
  to safeguard sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  By restricting connections to private networks, organizations can significantly
  reduce the risk of data exposure and maintain compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, ensuring that only trusted and authenticated users can access critical
  resources.
description: This security rule ensures that all connections to the IBM Cloud Data
  Virtualization service are configured to use private networking. The rule checks
  for the enforcement of private network access, which helps to isolate the data virtualization
  environment from public internet exposure. By implementing private networking, organizations
  enhance their security posture by minimizing attack vectors and ensuring that data
  exchanges occur within a controlled and secure network environment. This practice
  supports compliance with security frameworks that demand stringent access control
  and data protection measures.
