title: Ensuring Immutable Retention for Data Virtualization Governance
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing immutable retention policies is critical for safeguarding data
  integrity and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. By locking data
  retention settings, organizations can prevent unauthorized alterations or deletions,
  thereby protecting sensitive information and maintaining trust with stakeholders.
  This control is especially vital in industries with stringent data protection mandates,
  minimizing the risk of non-compliance fines and data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that immutable retention settings are enforced within
  the data virtualization governance lifecycle, ensuring that data stored is protected
  against unauthorized changes. By implementing retention locks, organizations can
  guarantee that data remains unaltered for a defined period, aligning with legal
  and regulatory frameworks such as GDPR or HIPAA. This not only enhances data protection
  but also demonstrates due diligence in compliance audits, reducing the risk of penalties
  and enhancing the organization's overall security posture.
