title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Lineage Table Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring least privilege access to lineage tables in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential
  data breaches. By restricting access to only those users and roles that require
  it, organizations can protect sensitive metadata and maintain the integrity of data
  governance processes, ultimately reducing the risk of non-compliance with regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule evaluates the access policies applied to lineage tables within
  the Data Virtualization catalog, ensuring they adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. It checks the permissions assigned to users and roles, verifying that
  only essential access is granted based on job responsibilities. By enforcing least
  privilege, organizations can enhance their security posture, prevent unauthorized
  data access, and align with compliance frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  mandate stringent access controls.
