rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog.metadata_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Metadata Encryption is Enabled for Data Virtualization Catalog
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling metadata encryption for the data virtualization catalog is crucial
  to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Without encryption, metadata,
  which can contain critical information about data sources and structures, may be
  exposed to potential threats, leading to data breaches and non-compliance with industry
  regulations.
description: This rule checks whether metadata encryption is enabled for the data
  virtualization catalog in IBM Cloud. Enabling encryption at rest ensures that all
  metadata stored within the catalog is encrypted, providing an additional layer of
  security that prevents unauthorized access and protects against data breaches. This
  practice aligns with industry standards for data protection and privacy, ensuring
  compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. By enforcing metadata encryption,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with sensitive information exposure
  and enhance their overall security posture.
