rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.catalog.catalog_cross_account_sharing_review_required
title: Ensure Review of Cross-Account Sharing in Data Virtualization Catalog
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Cross-account sharing in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization catalog can introduce
  risks related to unauthorized access and data exposure. Regular reviews of catalog
  sharing settings are crucial to ensure that only authorized accounts have access,
  thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of your cloud environment.
description: This rule mandates a periodic review of cross-account sharing configurations
  within the IBM Data Virtualization service's catalog. It checks for any settings
  that allow catalog access to external accounts, ensuring that all such configurations
  are intentional and aligned with organizational security policies. By enforcing
  this review, organizations can detect and mitigate potential unauthorized access,
  thereby improving data governance and aligning with compliance requirements such
  as GDPR or HIPAA. This practice also enhances the auditability of data sharing actions,
  which is a fundamental aspect of robust cloud security posture management.
