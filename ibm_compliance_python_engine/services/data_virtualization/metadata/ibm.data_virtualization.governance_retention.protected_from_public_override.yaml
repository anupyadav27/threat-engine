title: Prevent Public Overrides on Data Virtualization Governance Retention
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that data governance retention settings in IBM Cloud's Data Virtualization
  service are protected from public overrides is crucial for maintaining data integrity
  and confidentiality. Unauthorized changes to retention policies can lead to data
  exposure, compliance violations, and significant business risks, including financial
  penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks that governance retention settings within the IBM Cloud
  Data Virtualization service are not susceptible to unauthorized public overrides.
  By enforcing strict access controls, this rule enhances security by ensuring that
  only authorized users can modify retention policies, thereby protecting sensitive
  data from exposure. Compliance benefits include alignment with industry standards
  and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection
  and privacy measures.
