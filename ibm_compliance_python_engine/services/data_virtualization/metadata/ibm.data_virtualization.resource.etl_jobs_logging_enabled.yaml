title: Ensure ETL Jobs Logging is Enabled for Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for ETL jobs within IBM Cloud Data Virtualization is critical
  for maintaining visibility into data processing activities. This aids in the detection
  of unauthorized access or anomalies and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements
  by providing a detailed audit trail. Without logging, organizations risk operational
  inefficiencies and potential breaches going undetected, which could lead to significant
  financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for all ETL jobs within the
  IBM Cloud Data Virtualization service. By ensuring that all data transformation
  and loading activities are logged, organizations can maintain a comprehensive audit
  trail of data movements and transformations. This not only strengthens the security
  posture by allowing real-time monitoring and forensic analysis but also supports
  compliance initiatives by providing evidence of data handling practices. Proper
  logging assists in identifying and mitigating potential security incidents swiftly,
  thereby enhancing the overall integrity and confidentiality of the data.
