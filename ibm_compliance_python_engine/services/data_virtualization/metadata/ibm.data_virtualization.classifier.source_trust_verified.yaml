title: Ensuring Source Trust Verification for Data Virtualization Classifiers
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Verifying the trustworthiness of data sources in the Data Virtualization
  service is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security. Failure to ensure
  source trust can lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, or breaches,
  impacting both compliance and organizational trust. Implementing source trust verification
  mitigates risks associated with data compromise and enhances overall data governance.
description: This rule assesses whether the classifiers in the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  service have their source trust verified. It checks the configuration settings to
  ensure that all data sources connected to the service are authenticated and authorized.
  By confirming source trust, this rule enhances the security posture by preventing
  unauthorized access and ensuring that only validated sources can provide data. This
  practice not only safeguards sensitive information but also aligns with data protection
  regulations and industry standards, thus supporting compliance efforts.
