rule_id: ibm.data_virtualization.connection.role_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Virtualization Connections
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Adhering to the principle of least privilege ensures that users have only
  the permissions necessary to perform their tasks, minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access or accidental data exposure. This approach not only protects sensitive data
  but also helps maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, reducing potential
  legal liabilities and safeguarding the organization's reputation.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions assigned to roles used for data virtualization
  connections on IBM Cloud, ensuring they align with the principle of least privilege.
  By restricting access rights to the minimum necessary, it mitigates vulnerabilities
  that could be exploited by malicious actors or internal threats. Implementing least
  privilege supports compliance with frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, enhancing
  the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface. Regular audits and
  adjustments to role permissions are crucial to maintaining this security measure.
