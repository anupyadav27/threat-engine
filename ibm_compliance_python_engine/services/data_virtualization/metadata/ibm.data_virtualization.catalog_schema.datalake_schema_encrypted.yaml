title: Ensure Encryption of Datalake Schema in IBM Data Virtualization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the datalake schema within IBM Data Virtualization is crucial
  for protecting sensitive information against unauthorized access and data breaches.
  Without encryption, sensitive data could be exposed, leading to compliance violations,
  financial loss, and reputational damage. Implementing encryption at rest ensures
  that data remains secure even if physical security measures are compromised.
description: This rule checks whether the schema in the datalake of IBM Data Virtualization
  is encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest involves encoding data stored on disk to
  prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized users with the correct
  decryption keys can access the data. This enhances the overall security posture
  by minimizing the risk of data exposure and aids in compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate the protection of sensitive data
  through encryption.
