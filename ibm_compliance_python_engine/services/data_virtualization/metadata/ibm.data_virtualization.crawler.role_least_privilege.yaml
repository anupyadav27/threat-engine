title: Enforce Least Privilege for IBM Cloud Data Virtualization Crawlers
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for data virtualization crawlers
  is crucial to minimize potential security risks. By restricting permissions to only
  what is necessary, organizations can reduce the attack surface, prevent unauthorized
  access, and protect sensitive data. This approach not only enhances the security
  posture but also aligns with compliance requirements and industry best practices.
description: This rule examines the permissions assigned to data virtualization crawlers
  to ensure they adhere to the least privilege principle. It checks that crawlers
  have the minimum necessary roles to perform their tasks without excessive permissions
  that could lead to potential misuse or data breaches. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can improve their security posture, maintain tighter access control, and ensure
  compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent
  access controls and data protection measures.
