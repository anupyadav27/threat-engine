title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing for Datalake Databases
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of datalake databases is crucial to maintaining
  strong data protection and privacy standards. Unauthorized access to sensitive data
  can lead to significant security breaches, compromising business operations and
  damaging reputations. Ensuring that datalake databases are not shared across accounts
  without proper controls helps mitigate the risk of data leaks and compliance violations.
description: This rule ensures that datalake databases within the IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  service are not shared across accounts without explicit authorization and security
  controls. By restricting cross-account sharing, organizations can better enforce
  data access policies and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of their sensitive
  information. Implementing this rule not only strengthens security posture but also
  aids in achieving compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
  Regular audits and monitoring of database sharing configurations are recommended
  to ensure ongoing compliance and security.
