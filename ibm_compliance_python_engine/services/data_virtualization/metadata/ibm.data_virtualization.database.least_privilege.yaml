title: Enforce Least Privilege Access for IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege within IBM Cloud Data Virtualization
  ensures that users and applications have only the necessary access to perform their
  functions. This minimizes the potential for unintended data exposure or misuse,
  protecting sensitive business information and reducing the risk of data breaches.
  Adhering to this principle is crucial for maintaining robust security postures and
  meeting compliance mandates.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the least privilege principle in IBM
  Cloud's Data Virtualization service by examining database access permissions. It
  ensures that access rights are restricted to only those necessary for legitimate
  business functions, preventing over-privileged access that could lead to unauthorized
  data manipulation or exposure. By maintaining strict access controls, organizations
  can better safeguard their data assets, align with regulatory requirements such
  as GDPR or HIPAA, and enhance their overall security posture.
