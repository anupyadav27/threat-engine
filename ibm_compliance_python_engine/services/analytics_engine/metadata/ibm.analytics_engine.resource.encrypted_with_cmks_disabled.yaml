title: Enforce Customer-Managed Key Encryption for Analytics Engine
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Analytics Engine resources are encrypted using Customer-Managed
  Keys (CMKs) is crucial for enhancing data security and maintaining customer control
  over encryption keys. This practice minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and
  data breaches, thus aligning with stringent data protection regulations and fostering
  customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that all IBM Analytics Engine resources are
  encrypted with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) rather than using default encryption
  settings. By enforcing CMK usage, organizations gain greater control over the encryption
  process and key lifecycle management, allowing for compliance with various regulatory
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing CMK encryption reduces the risk of
  data exposure by ensuring that only authorized users have access to the keys needed
  to decrypt sensitive information.
