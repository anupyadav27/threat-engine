rule_id: ibm.analytics_engine.cluster.publicly_accesible
title: Prevent Public Access to IBM Analytics Engine Clusters
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Analytics Engine clusters are not publicly accessible
  is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. Public exposure of clusters can lead to exploitation by malicious actors,
  resulting in data leakage, service disruption, and significant financial and reputational
  damage to the organization.
description: This rule evaluates the accessibility of IBM Analytics Engine clusters
  and ensures they are not configured for public access. By enforcing private network
  access, this rule mitigates unauthorized access risks and strengthens the overall
  security posture of the analytics environment. Implementing this control helps in
  meeting compliance requirements by aligning with best practices for access management
  and data protection, thus safeguarding the organization's analytic workloads and
  sensitive information.
