rule_id: ibm.analytics_engine.cluster.account_public_block_enabled
title: Ensure Public Access Block is Enabled for IBM Analytics Engine Clusters
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling the account-level public access block for IBM Analytics Engine
  clusters is critical to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By restricting public access, organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain
  compliance with industry standards, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents
  that could lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether the public access block is enabled at the account
  level for IBM Analytics Engine clusters. Enabling this setting ensures that no resources
  within the cluster can be accessed publicly, reducing the attack surface and enhancing
  overall security posture. It helps organizations adhere to compliance requirements
  by ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to the internet, aligning with best
  practices for identity and access management. Implementing this control is essential
  for maintaining a secure cloud environment and safeguarding organizational data.
