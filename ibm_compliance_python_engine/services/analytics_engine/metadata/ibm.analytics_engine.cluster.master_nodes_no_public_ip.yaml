rule_id: ibm.analytics_engine.cluster.master_nodes_no_public_ip
title: Ensure Master Nodes in IBM Analytics Engine Lack Public IP Addresses
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Preventing public IP assignment to master nodes in IBM Analytics Engine
  is critical to reducing the attack surface and mitigating potential unauthorized
  access. Public IPs expose master nodes to the internet, increasing the risk of external
  threats such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches, which can
  lead to significant financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that master nodes within an IBM Analytics Engine cluster
  do not have public IP addresses assigned. By ensuring that these nodes are only
  accessible through private network configurations, this rule enhances the security
  posture by minimizing exposure to external threats and complying with best practices
  in identity and access management. Implementing this check helps maintain a robust
  security framework, aligning with compliance standards that demand restricted access
  to critical infrastructure components.
