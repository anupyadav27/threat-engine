title: KMS Key Deletion Alert Monitoring for Improved Security
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring Key Management Service (KMS) key deletions is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and security of encrypted data. Unauthorized or accidental deletion
  of encryption keys can lead to data loss and potential breaches, undermining business
  operations and trust. By alerting on KMS key deletions, organizations can quickly
  respond to potential security incidents and ensure compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This security rule checks for the creation of alerts related to the deletion
  of keys within the IBM Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). It ensures that any deletion
  activity is promptly logged and monitored, allowing for immediate notification and
  investigation. This practice not only enhances the security posture by mitigating
  risks associated with unauthorized key deletions but also aids in compliance with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection and audit logging.
