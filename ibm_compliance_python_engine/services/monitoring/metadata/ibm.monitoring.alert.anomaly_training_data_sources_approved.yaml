rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.anomaly_training_data_sources_approved
title: Approval of Anomaly Training Data Sources in Monitoring Alerts
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring that anomaly training data sources are approved is crucial to
  maintaining the integrity and reliability of alerting systems. Unauthorized or unverified
  data sources can lead to false alerts or missed anomalies, potentially resulting
  in security breaches or operational disruptions. Approving data sources helps organizations
  maintain trust in their monitoring systems and supports compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This rule checks whether the data sources used for training anomaly detection
  models in IBM Cloud Monitoring are approved by security and compliance teams. By
  verifying data source approval, organizations can ensure that only trusted datasets
  inform anomaly detection, reducing the risk of false positives or negatives in alerting.
  This practice enhances security by ensuring accurate monitoring and aids in meeting
  audit and compliance requirements by demonstrating due diligence in data source
  verification.
