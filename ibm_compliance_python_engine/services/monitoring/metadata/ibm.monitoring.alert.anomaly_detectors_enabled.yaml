title: Enable Anomaly Detectors for Enhanced Monitoring Security
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling anomaly detectors in monitoring alerts provides proactive identification
  of unusual activities, which could indicate potential security threats or system
  malfunctions. This capability is crucial for maintaining a secure cloud environment
  and ensuring business continuity by allowing timely responses to anomalies, thereby
  minimizing potential damage.
description: This rule checks whether anomaly detectors are enabled for monitoring
  alerts within IBM Cloud. Anomaly detection analyzes historical data to identify
  deviations from normal patterns, offering early warnings of possible security incidents
  or operational issues. By enabling this feature, organizations enhance their security
  posture, gain deeper insights into system behavior, and align with compliance requirements
  that mandate robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
