title: Ensure DR Alerts for Replication Lag Are Configured in IBM Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) alerts for replication lag is crucial
  to maintaining data integrity and availability in a cloud environment. These alerts
  help detect and address delays in data replication that could lead to data inconsistency
  or loss during failover scenarios. Timely detection of replication lag allows businesses
  to take corrective actions quickly, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuity
  of operations.
description: This security rule checks whether disaster recovery alerts are configured
  for monitoring replication lag within IBM Cloud. By setting up these alerts, organizations
  can proactively monitor their data replication processes, ensuring that any deviations
  from the expected replication time are promptly identified and addressed. Implementing
  such alerts enhances security by ensuring that data remains consistent across different
  locations and aligns with compliance standards for data integrity and availability.
  Regular monitoring and alerting reduce the risk of data loss or corruption, thus
  supporting business continuity plans.
