title: Ensure DR Alerts for RPO/RTO Breach Are Configured in IBM Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alerts for Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time
  Objective (RTO) breaches is critical in maintaining business continuity and minimizing
  data loss during a disaster. These alerts allow IT teams to respond swiftly to potential
  issues, ensuring that recovery processes are initiated promptly to meet compliance
  and operational standards.
description: This rule checks whether alerts are configured in IBM Monitoring for
  breaches of RPO and RTO thresholds, which are essential metrics in disaster recovery
  planning. By ensuring these alerts are in place, organizations can quickly detect
  and address deviations from recovery objectives, thereby enhancing their ability
  to maintain data integrity and availability. This proactive approach not only strengthens
  security posture but also aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements related
  to disaster recovery and business continuity.
