title: Monitor Unused Console Access for Policy Changes in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Regularly reviewing and managing unused console access for policy changes
  is critical to maintaining a secure IBM Cloud environment. Unused access can be
  exploited by malicious actors to alter policies, leading to potential security breaches
  and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Ensuring that only necessary users have
  access reduces the risk of accidental or malicious policy changes, thereby protecting
  organizational assets and maintaining compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks for instances where console access related to policy
  changes in IBM Cloud's monitoring service has not been used for a specified period.
  By identifying and reviewing unused access, organizations can revoke permissions
  from inactive users, thereby minimizing the attack surface and reducing the likelihood
  of unauthorized policy modifications. This proactive measure enhances the security
  posture by ensuring that only active users with valid roles have the ability to
  make policy changes, aligning with best practices for identity and access management.
  Additionally, maintaining a clean and efficient access control system supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and ISO 27001.
