title: Ensure Diagnostic Settings Are Enabled for Monitoring Services
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling diagnostic settings for monitoring services is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture within IBM Cloud environments. It allows organizations
  to capture detailed operational metrics and logs, facilitating timely detection
  and response to potential security incidents. Moreover, it supports compliance with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements by providing a comprehensive audit
  trail of system activities.
description: This rule verifies that diagnostic settings are enabled for monitoring
  services within the IBM Cloud. By ensuring these settings are active, organizations
  can collect essential performance and security metrics, which aid in identifying
  anomalies and potential threats. This capability not only enhances the visibility
  of system operations but also strengthens the overall security framework by supporting
  continuous monitoring and audit logging. Implementing diagnostic settings aligns
  with best practices for cloud security, ensuring that organizations can maintain
  compliance with various regulatory frameworks and internal security policies.
