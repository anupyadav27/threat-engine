title: Ensure Alarm Actions Are Configured for Monitoring Alerts
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alarm actions for monitoring alerts is crucial for timely incident
  response and mitigation of potential security threats. Without predefined actions,
  critical alerts may go unnoticed, leading to prolonged downtime, data breaches,
  or non-compliance with industry standards. Properly configured alarm actions enable
  automated responses and notifications, ensuring that security teams are promptly
  informed and can take immediate corrective actions.
description: This rule checks whether alarm actions are configured for IBM Cloud monitoring
  alerts, which involves setting up notifications or automated responses when specific
  conditions are met. By ensuring alarm actions are in place, organizations can enhance
  their security posture by reducing the mean time to detection (MTTD) and mean time
  to response (MTTR) for security incidents. This proactive approach not only strengthens
  the overall security framework but also supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  that mandate timely incident detection and response. Implementing proper alarm actions
  ensures that alerts are not just logged but actively managed and addressed.
