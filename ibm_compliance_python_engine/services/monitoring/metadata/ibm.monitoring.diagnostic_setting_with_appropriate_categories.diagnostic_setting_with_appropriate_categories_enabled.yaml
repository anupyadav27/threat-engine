title: Ensure Diagnostic Settings Include Appropriate Logging Categories
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling diagnostic settings with appropriate logging categories is crucial
  for maintaining comprehensive visibility into cloud operations. It ensures that
  critical events are captured for future analysis, aiding in the detection of suspicious
  activities and compliance with regulatory requirements. This proactive approach
  minimizes security risks and enhances operational integrity.
description: This rule checks that diagnostic settings in IBM Cloud Monitoring are
  configured to include all relevant logging categories. By doing so, it captures
  a complete set of operational and security-related events, which are essential for
  effective monitoring and incident response. Properly configured diagnostic settings
  align with best practices for audit logging, thereby supporting compliance with
  industry standards and improving the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
