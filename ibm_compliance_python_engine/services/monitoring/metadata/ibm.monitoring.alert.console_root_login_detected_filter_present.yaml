rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.console_root_login_detected_filter_present
title: Detection of Console Root Login Attempts in IBM Cloud Monitoring
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring and alerting on root login attempts to the console is crucial
  as it helps in identifying potential unauthorized access or misuse of administrative
  privileges. Such activities could lead to data breaches, system compromises, or
  the disruption of services, thereby impacting the organization's operational integrity
  and trust.
description: This rule checks for filters that detect root login attempts through
  the IBM Cloud console, ensuring that alerts are configured to notify administrators
  of such events. By continuously monitoring for root access, organizations can swiftly
  respond to and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access. Implementing
  this rule enhances security posture by enforcing audit logging practices, thereby
  aiding in compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements concerning
  access control and auditability.
