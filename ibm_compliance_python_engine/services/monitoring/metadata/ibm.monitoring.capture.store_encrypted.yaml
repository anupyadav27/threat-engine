rule_id: ibm.monitoring.capture.store_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Stored Monitoring Data
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting monitoring data at rest is critical to safeguarding sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Failing to secure
  this data can lead to significant business risks, including the compromise of sensitive
  operational insights and violation of regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule mandates that all monitoring data captured and stored within
  IBM Cloud services must be encrypted at rest. By implementing encryption, this rule
  ensures that data remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access, even
  in the event of physical storage compromise. Encrypting stored data aligns with
  industry best practices for data protection and assists in meeting compliance obligations,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data security measures.
