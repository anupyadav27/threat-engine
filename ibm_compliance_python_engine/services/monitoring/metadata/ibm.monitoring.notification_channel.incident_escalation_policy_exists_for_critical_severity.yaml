title: Ensure Critical Incident Escalation Policy Exists for Monitoring Channels
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Implementing an incident escalation policy for critical severity events
  is crucial to maintain the integrity and availability of cloud services. This ensures
  that critical incidents are promptly addressed, minimizing potential impacts on
  business operations and customer satisfaction. It also aids in maintaining compliance
  with industry standards and regulatory requirements by demonstrating a proactive
  approach to incident management.
description: This rule verifies that an incident escalation policy is established
  for notification channels associated with critical severity events in IBM Cloud
  Monitoring. By ensuring an escalation policy is in place, organizations can guarantee
  that critical alerts are escalated to appropriate personnel or teams for swift resolution.
  This practice not only enhances the security posture by reducing response times
  to potential threats but also aids in audit logging and compliance by providing
  a structured response mechanism for critical incidents.
