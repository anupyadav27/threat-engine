title: Ensure DR Alerts for Backup Failures Are Configured in IBM Monitoring
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alerts for backup failures is crucial for maintaining robust
  disaster recovery (DR) strategies. Timely alerts enable organizations to address
  backup issues promptly, minimizing potential data loss and ensuring business continuity.
  Without these alerts, backup failures may go unnoticed, leading to significant operational
  disruptions and compliance risks.
description: This rule checks whether alerts for backup failures are configured within
  the IBM Cloud monitoring service. By ensuring that alerts are set up, organizations
  can quickly respond to any issues in their backup processes, thereby enhancing their
  overall security posture. Proper alert configurations support compliance with data
  protection regulations and industry standards, as they help maintain the integrity
  and availability of critical data systems. Monitoring alerts for backup failures
  is a proactive measure that helps to mitigate risks associated with data loss and
  ensures adherence to best practices in disaster recovery planning.
