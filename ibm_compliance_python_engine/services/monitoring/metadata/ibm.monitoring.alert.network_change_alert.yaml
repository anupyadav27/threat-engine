rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.network_change_alert
title: Network Change Alert Monitoring for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring for network changes is crucial to identify unauthorized or unexpected
  modifications that could indicate a security breach or misconfiguration. Timely
  alerts help organizations respond quickly to potential threats, minimizing the risk
  of data exposure, service disruptions, and compliance violations. Ensuring network
  integrity supports business continuity and protects sensitive data.
description: This rule focuses on generating alerts for any changes in network configurations,
  such as modifications to routing tables, firewall rules, or security groups within
  the IBM Cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and alerting on these changes,
  organizations can swiftly identify and address potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
  This enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that any unauthorized changes
  are promptly investigated. Additionally, this practice aids in maintaining compliance
  with standards that require stringent auditing and monitoring of network activities,
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS.
