rule_id: ibm.monitoring.notification_channel.incident_escalation_oncall_contacts_verified
title: Verification of Oncall Contacts for Incident Escalation in Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring that oncall contacts are verified is crucial for maintaining the
  integrity and reliability of incident response processes. Unverified or outdated
  contacts can lead to delays in addressing critical incidents, potentially resulting
  in prolonged service disruptions and increased operational risks. Verifying contacts
  helps ensure that the right personnel are promptly notified and can take immediate
  action to mitigate issues.
description: This rule checks whether all oncall contacts associated with incident
  escalation notification channels in the IBM Cloud Monitoring service have been verified.
  By verifying these contacts, organizations can ensure that their incident management
  process is robust and effective, reducing the likelihood of communication failures
  during critical incidents. This practice not only enhances security by ensuring
  timely responses to incidents but also supports compliance with industry standards
  that require clear and reliable communication channels for incident management.
