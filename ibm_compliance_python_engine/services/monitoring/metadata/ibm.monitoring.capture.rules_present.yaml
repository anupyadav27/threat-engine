rule_id: ibm.monitoring.capture.rules_present
title: Ensuring Monitoring Capture Rules are Present for Audit Compliance
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring that monitoring capture rules are present is crucial for maintaining
  comprehensive audit trails and detecting unauthorized activities within cloud environments.
  Without these rules, critical events may not be logged, potentially leading to undetected
  security breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations, which could result
  in financial penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks for the presence of monitoring capture rules within
  IBM Cloud's monitoring services. By verifying that these rules are configured, organizations
  can ensure that all relevant events and activities are logged, thereby enhancing
  visibility into system operations and potential security incidents. Implementing
  this rule supports compliance with various security standards and frameworks by
  ensuring that audit logging practices are consistently applied and maintained across
  cloud resources.
