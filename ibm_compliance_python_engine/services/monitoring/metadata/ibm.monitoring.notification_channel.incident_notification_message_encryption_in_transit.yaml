title: Ensure Encryption In Transit for Monitoring Notification Channels
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting incident notification messages in transit is crucial for protecting
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and interception during transmission.
  This practice mitigates the risk of data breaches and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations, thereby safeguarding organizational reputation and maintaining
  customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that incident notification messages sent through IBM
  Cloud Monitoring notification channels are encrypted during transmission. By enforcing
  encryption in transit, the rule enhances data protection by preventing unauthorized
  interception or tampering of sensitive information while it traverses networks.
  This aligns with best practices for data protection and helps organizations meet
  regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of
  data in transit.
