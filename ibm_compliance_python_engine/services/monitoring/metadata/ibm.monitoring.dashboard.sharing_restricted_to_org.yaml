rule_id: ibm.monitoring.dashboard.sharing_restricted_to_org
title: Ensure Monitoring Dashboards Are Shared Within Organization Only
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Restricting the sharing of monitoring dashboards to within the organization
  ensures that sensitive monitoring data, which might include performance metrics
  and potential security vulnerabilities, is not exposed to unauthorized external
  parties. This practice minimizes the risk of data breaches and helps maintain the
  integrity and confidentiality of business-critical operational data.
description: This rule checks that IBM Cloud monitoring dashboards are configured
  such that sharing permissions are restricted to users within the same organization.
  By limiting access in this way, organizations can enforce internal data governance
  policies and adhere to compliance regulations that mandate data protection and privacy.
  Implementing this control helps safeguard sensitive information and prevents unauthorized
  access, thereby reducing potential security risks associated with data exposure.
