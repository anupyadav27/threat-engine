rule_id: ibm.monitoring.notification_channel.incident_notification_no_public_webhooks
title: Prohibit Public Webhooks for Incident Notifications in IBM Cloud Monitoring
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enforcing the prohibition of public webhooks for incident notifications
  ensures that sensitive monitoring alerts are not exposed to unauthorized external
  entities. Public webhooks can be exploited by malicious actors to intercept or manipulate
  alert data, leading to potential data breaches or disruption of response processes.
  By restricting notifications to private channels, organizations can maintain the
  integrity and confidentiality of their incident response strategies, thereby minimizing
  risk and aligning with security best practices.
description: This rule checks for the presence of public webhooks in IBM Cloud Monitoring
  notification channels and flags any configurations that allow public access. By
  eliminating public webhooks, the rule ensures that incident notifications are only
  transmitted through secure, private channels, reducing the risk of data interception
  and unauthorized access. This practice not only enhances the organization's security
  posture but also helps maintain compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements that mandate the protection of sensitive information.
