title: Ensure Minimum Retention Days Configured for Monitoring Capture
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for monitoring data ensures that
  critical audit and monitoring logs are preserved for compliance and forensic investigations.
  Insufficient retention can lead to loss of essential data, hindering the ability
  to detect and respond to security incidents and failing to meet regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether a minimum number of retention days is configured
  for monitoring data captures in IBM Cloud. By enforcing a baseline retention period,
  organizations can ensure that logs and monitoring data are available for analysis
  in case of security incidents. This practice not only strengthens the security posture
  by enabling thorough incident investigation but also supports compliance with industry
  standards that mandate data retention, such as GDPR or HIPAA.
