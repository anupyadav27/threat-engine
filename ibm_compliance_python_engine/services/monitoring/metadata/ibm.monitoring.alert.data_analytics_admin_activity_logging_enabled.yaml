rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.data_analytics_admin_activity_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Data Analytics Admin Activity Logging is Enabled for Alerts
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling admin activity logging for data analytics tools is crucial for
  maintaining transparency and accountability within your cloud environment. This
  practice helps detect unauthorized access and modifications to data analytics configurations
  and resources, which can prevent data breaches and unauthorized data manipulation.
  Moreover, it supports compliance with regulatory standards that mandate detailed
  activity logs for audit purposes.
description: This rule verifies that logging for admin activities related to data
  analytics alerts is enabled within the IBM Cloud Monitoring service. By ensuring
  this logging is active, organizations can capture and review detailed records of
  administrative actions such as configuration changes, user management, and policy
  updates. This enhances security by enabling prompt detection of suspicious activities
  and facilitating forensic investigations. Additionally, it aids in demonstrating
  compliance with industry regulations and internal policies by providing a comprehensive
  audit trail.
