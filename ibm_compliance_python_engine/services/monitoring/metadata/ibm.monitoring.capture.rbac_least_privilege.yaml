rule_id: ibm.monitoring.capture.rbac_least_privilege
title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for IBM Cloud Monitoring
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege within IBM Cloud Monitoring
  ensures that users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their
  functions, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or accidental data exposure.
  This approach minimizes potential security breaches and protects sensitive monitoring
  data, which is crucial for maintaining operational integrity and trust with stakeholders.
description: The rule verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings for
  IBM Cloud Monitoring are configured to adhere to the least privilege principle.
  It checks that users and roles assigned to the monitoring.capture resource have
  only the necessary permissions to perform their assigned tasks. By restricting excessive
  permissions, this rule enhances the security posture by limiting potential attack
  vectors and ensuring compliance with industry standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and
  NIST SP 800-53. Adhering to this rule helps maintain a secure and compliant cloud
  environment by safeguarding monitoring data and operations.
