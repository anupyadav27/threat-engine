rule_id: ibm.monitoring.notification_channel.incident_notification_destinations_configured
title: Ensure Incident Notification Destinations Are Configured in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring incident notification destinations is crucial for timely alerting
  and response to potential security incidents. Without proper notifications, critical
  events may go unnoticed, leading to prolonged exposure to security threats and potential
  business disruptions. By ensuring notifications are configured, organizations can
  promptly address incidents, reducing the risk and impact of security breaches.
description: This rule checks whether incident notification destinations are configured
  within the IBM Cloud monitoring service. It ensures that alerts generated by monitoring
  tools are delivered to designated channels, enabling prompt incident response and
  mitigation. Implementing this configuration enhances the security posture by facilitating
  real-time awareness and management of security events. Compliance with this rule
  supports adherence to best practices in security operations and audit readiness
  by maintaining comprehensive incident monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
