rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.data_analytics_query_access_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Data Analytics Query Access Logging is Enabled for Alerts
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling query access logging for data analytics is crucial for tracking
  user activities and access patterns within the IBM Cloud Monitoring service. This
  practice helps in identifying unauthorized access attempts and potential security
  breaches, thereby minimizing the risk of data loss or exposure. Business-wise, it
  ensures accountability and traceability, which are essential for maintaining customer
  trust and meeting compliance requirements.
description: This rule verifies that query access logging is enabled for all data
  analytics queries associated with IBM Cloud Monitoring alerts. By doing so, it ensures
  that all interactions with alert data are logged, providing a detailed audit trail
  that can be used for forensic analysis and compliance reporting. Enabling such logging
  enhances the security posture by allowing timely detection and response to suspicious
  activities. It also aids in meeting regulatory standards that mandate comprehensive
  audit logging, thus supporting organizational compliance initiatives.
