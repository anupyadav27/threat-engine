title: Audit Logging for Incident Escalation Changes in Notification Channels
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for incident escalation changes in notification
  channels is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability within an organization's
  monitoring infrastructure. This practice helps detect unauthorized changes, ensuring
  only approved personnel make critical adjustments, thus minimizing the risk of configuration
  errors or malicious actions that could lead to service disruptions or data breaches.
description: This rule examines whether audit logging is enabled for incident escalation
  changes within the notification channels of IBM Cloud's monitoring service. By ensuring
  that all modifications to escalation settings are logged, organizations can maintain
  a detailed record of who made changes, what was altered, and when. This not only
  strengthens security by providing a trail for forensic analysis in the event of
  an incident but also aids in compliance with industry standards and regulations
  that require comprehensive logging of security-related activities.
