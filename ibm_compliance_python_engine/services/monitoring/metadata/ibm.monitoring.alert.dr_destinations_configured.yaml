title: Ensure Disaster Recovery Destinations for Monitoring Alerts
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) destinations for monitoring alerts is
  crucial to maintain operational resilience during incidents. It ensures that critical
  alerts are still received and acted upon even if the primary monitoring system becomes
  unavailable, thereby minimizing downtime and reducing potential business impact.
description: This rule checks whether disaster recovery destinations are configured
  for monitoring alerts within IBM Cloud. By establishing DR destinations, organizations
  can ensure continuity in alerting mechanisms, allowing for swift incident response
  and maintaining security posture. This practice not only enhances the overall reliability
  of cloud operations but also supports compliance with industry standards that require
  robust monitoring and alerting systems. Implementing DR configurations helps safeguard
  against data loss and service interruptions, thereby improving organizational resilience
  and trustworthiness.
