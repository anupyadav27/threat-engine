title: Configuration of Anomaly Alerts in IBM Cloud Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring anomaly alerts in IBM Cloud Monitoring is crucial for proactively
  identifying and addressing unusual patterns or deviations in system performance
  and behavior. This rule aids in mitigating potential security threats and operational
  disruptions, ensuring business continuity and maintaining service reliability.
description: This rule checks whether anomaly alerts are configured in IBM Cloud Monitoring,
  which provide early warnings by detecting patterns that deviate from normal operational
  behavior. By configuring these alerts, organizations can swiftly respond to potential
  security incidents or system issues, thereby enhancing their security posture. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with auditing requirements by providing a mechanism to monitor
  and log anomalous activities, which is critical for maintaining regulatory standards
  and demonstrating due diligence.
