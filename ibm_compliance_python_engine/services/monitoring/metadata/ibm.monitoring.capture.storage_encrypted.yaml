title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for IBM Cloud Monitoring Storage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting data at rest through encryption is critical to safeguarding
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential breaches. By enforcing
  encryption for monitoring data storage, organizations can mitigate the risks associated
  with data leakage and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
  This not only enhances the trustworthiness of the cloud environment but also aligns
  with best practices for data protection and privacy.
description: This rule verifies that all data stored within the IBM Cloud Monitoring
  service's capture storage is encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest involves converting
  data into a secure format that can only be read by someone who has the encryption
  key, thereby enhancing data security. Implementing encryption for storage protects
  against unauthorized access and potential data breaches, ensuring that sensitive
  information remains confidential and secure. By complying with this rule, organizations
  can meet various regulatory and industry standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI
  DSS, which mandate encryption of data at rest as a critical security measure.
