rule_id: ibm.monitoring.dashboard.public_embeds_disabled
title: Enforce Disabling of Public Embeds for Monitoring Dashboards
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Disabling public embeds for monitoring dashboards is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive data visualizations. Publicly accessible dashboards
  can expose critical system metrics and operational data, potentially leading to
  exploitation by malicious actors. Ensuring these embeds are disabled helps maintain
  the confidentiality of your operational insights and supports regulatory compliance
  by safeguarding sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that public embeds are disabled for all monitoring
  dashboards within IBM Cloud Monitoring services. By enforcing this configuration,
  organizations prevent unauthorized external users from accessing dashboard data
  that could reveal sensitive operational details. Adhering to this rule enhances
  security by restricting data exposure only to authenticated and authorized personnel,
  thereby mitigating the risk of data breaches. Implementing this measure aligns with
  best practices for security posture management and supports compliance with industry
  standards by ensuring that only approved users have access to critical monitoring
  information.
