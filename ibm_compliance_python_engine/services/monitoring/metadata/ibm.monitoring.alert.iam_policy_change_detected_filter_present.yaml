rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.iam_policy_change_detected_filter_present
title: Ensure IAM Policy Change Alerts Include Specific Filters
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring for changes in IAM policies is crucial for maintaining the security
  and integrity of your cloud environment. Unauthorized or unexpected changes to IAM
  policies can lead to security breaches, data loss, or compliance violations. Implementing
  alerts with specific filters ensures that relevant changes are detected promptly,
  allowing for swift response and mitigation.
description: This rule verifies that alert configurations within the IBM Cloud monitoring
  service are set to detect specific changes in IAM policies. By enforcing the presence
  of filters in alerts, it ensures that only pertinent policy changes trigger alerts,
  reducing noise and focusing attention on critical security events. This practice
  enhances the security posture by enabling timely identification and response to
  unauthorized access attempts or configuration drift. Additionally, it aids in meeting
  compliance requirements by providing a robust audit trail of IAM policy changes.
