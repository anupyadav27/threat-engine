rule_id: ibm.monitoring.alert.destinations_authenticated
title: Ensure Authentication for Monitoring Alert Destinations
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring that alert destinations are authenticated is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of monitoring data. Without authentication, unauthorized
  parties could potentially intercept or manipulate alerts, leading to incorrect responses
  or unnoticed incidents. This practice also supports compliance with industry standards
  that mandate secure transmission of monitoring data.
description: This rule checks that all alert destinations configured within IBM Cloud
  Monitoring are authenticated. By enforcing authentication, the rule helps to verify
  that alerts are sent only to trusted entities, mitigating risks of data interception
  and unauthorized access. Proper authentication of alert destinations enhances the
  security posture by ensuring that monitoring data is securely transmitted, thereby
  supporting compliance with data protection regulations and audit requirements.
