title: Ensure Retention Policy Lifecycle Management for Monitoring Groups
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Proper management of retention policies in monitoring systems is crucial
  to maintain the integrity and availability of log data for auditing and compliance
  purposes. Ensuring that these policies are defined and managed effectively helps
  prevent data loss and ensures that critical security and operational insights are
  preserved for the required duration. This practice reduces the risk of non-compliance
  with regulatory requirements and supports effective incident response and forensic
  analysis.
description: This security rule checks whether the retention policy lifecycle is correctly
  configured and managed for monitoring groups within IBM Cloud. By enforcing lifecycle
  management, this rule ensures that log data is retained only as long as necessary,
  optimizing storage usage while maintaining compliance with data retention policies.
  Proper configuration of these policies enhances the security posture by allowing
  organizations to customize retention settings to meet their specific regulatory
  and business needs, thus supporting both operational efficiency and compliance.
