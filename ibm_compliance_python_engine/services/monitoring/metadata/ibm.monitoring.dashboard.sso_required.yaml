title: Enforce SSO for Secure IBM Cloud Monitoring Dashboards
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO) for IBM Cloud Monitoring dashboards is crucial
  for maintaining a secure access framework, minimizing unauthorized access risks.
  It enhances user authentication processes, ensuring that only verified users can
  view and manage sensitive monitoring data, which is vital for maintaining operational
  integrity and protecting business assets.
description: This rule checks whether the IBM Cloud Monitoring dashboards have SSO
  authentication enabled. By requiring SSO, organizations centralize and streamline
  the authentication process, reducing the risk of credential theft and account compromise.
  Enforcing SSO aligns with compliance standards by ensuring consistent access controls
  and auditability, which are critical for demonstrating adherence to security and
  privacy regulations.
