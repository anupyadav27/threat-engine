title: Ensure Minimum Retention Days for Data Analytics Logs in IBM Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for data analytics logs is crucial
  to ensure that historical data is available for auditing, compliance, and forensic
  investigations. Inadequate log retention can lead to gaps in security monitoring
  and make it difficult to track and respond to incidents. Properly retained logs
  support regulatory requirements and help prevent data loss.
description: This rule checks if a minimum data retention period is configured for
  analytics logs in IBM Cloud Monitoring services. Ensuring logs are retained for
  a minimum period enhances the ability to perform long-term analysis, detect anomalies,
  and meet compliance standards such as GDPR or PCI DSS. By maintaining a sufficient
  log retention duration, organizations can ensure that critical security events and
  operational data are preserved for audits, incident response, and compliance reporting.
