rule_id: ibm.monitoring.notification_channel.incident_notification_endpoints_authenticated
title: Ensure Authentication of Incident Notification Endpoints in IBM Cloud Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Proper authentication of incident notification endpoints is crucial to
  safeguard sensitive monitoring data and maintain the integrity of alerting processes.
  Unauthenticated endpoints could be exploited by malicious actors to intercept or
  alter critical alerts, potentially leading to undetected security incidents or operational
  issues. Ensuring authenticated endpoints helps organizations uphold their security
  posture and meet compliance requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all incident notification endpoints configured
  within the IBM Cloud Monitoring service are authenticated. By enforcing authentication,
  the rule ensures that alerts and notifications are securely transmitted to trusted
  parties, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data tampering. This practice
  not only enhances the security of the notification process but also supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulatory requirements by ensuring that only authorized
  entities receive sensitive monitoring alerts.
