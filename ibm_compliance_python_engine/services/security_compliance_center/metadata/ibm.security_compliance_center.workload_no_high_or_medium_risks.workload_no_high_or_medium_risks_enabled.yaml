title: Ensure Workloads Have No High or Medium Security Risks Enabled
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Properly managing security risks within workloads is critical to maintaining
  the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of business data and applications.
  High and medium security risks can lead to vulnerabilities that may be exploited
  by malicious actors, resulting in data breaches, service disruptions, and non-compliance
  with industry regulations. By ensuring workloads are free from these risks, organizations
  can safeguard their cloud environments and uphold trust with their clients.
description: This security rule checks IBM Cloud workloads to ensure they do not contain
  high or medium security risks. It evaluates configurations, access controls, and
  vulnerability assessments to identify potential security threats. By enabling this
  rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by proactively identifying
  and mitigating risks, thereby reducing the attack surface. Compliance benefits include
  aligning with industry standards and regulatory requirements, which often mandate
  the management and mitigation of security risks to prevent unauthorized access or
  data loss.
