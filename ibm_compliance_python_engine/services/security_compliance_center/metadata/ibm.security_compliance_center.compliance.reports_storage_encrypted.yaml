rule_id: ibm.security_compliance_center.compliance.reports_storage_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for Compliance Reports Storage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that compliance reports are encrypted while stored is vital for
  protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  The encryption of data at rest helps in maintaining data confidentiality and integrity,
  aligning with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. Failure to encrypt
  sensitive data can lead to financial penalties, reputational damage, and loss of
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether compliance reports stored within the IBM Cloud
  Security and Compliance Center are encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption, sensitive
  compliance data is safeguarded against unauthorized access and potential breaches,
  thus enhancing the overall security posture. Encryption at rest is a critical component
  of data protection strategies, ensuring that data remains secure even if it is accessed
  without authorization. Implementing this rule helps organizations meet stringent
  data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby reducing compliance
  risks and enhancing customer trust.
