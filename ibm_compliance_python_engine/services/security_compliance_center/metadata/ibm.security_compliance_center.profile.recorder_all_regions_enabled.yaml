rule_id: ibm.security_compliance_center.profile.recorder_all_regions_enabled
title: Ensure All Regions Are Enabled for Security Profile Recording
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the security recorder across all regions ensures comprehensive
  monitoring and auditing of security activities, crucial for maintaining a robust
  security posture. It helps in identifying unauthorized access or potential vulnerabilities
  across the entire IBM Cloud infrastructure, thereby minimizing the risk of security
  breaches and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the security compliance center's profile has
  the recorder feature enabled for all available regions. This configuration is essential
  to capture and log security-related events consistently across all geographical
  areas where IBM Cloud services are deployed. By ensuring that all regions are monitored,
  organizations can detect and respond to security incidents more effectively. This
  approach not only strengthens the security posture but also aids in meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements by providing a complete audit trail across the cloud environment.
