rule_id: ibm.security_compliance_center.classification.required_sensitivity_tags_present
title: Ensure Sensitivity Tags Are Assigned to Classified Data
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Sensitivity tags are crucial for identifying and managing data according
  to its confidentiality and privacy requirements. Without proper sensitivity tags,
  organizations risk exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access, potentially leading
  to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Ensuring
  that sensitivity tags are present helps in maintaining data integrity and protecting
  organizational reputation.
description: This rule checks that all classified data within the IBM Cloud Security
  Compliance Center are assigned appropriate sensitivity tags. By verifying the presence
  of these tags, the rule enforces a structured approach to data categorization, which
  enhances data protection through tailored encryption policies. This process not
  only strengthens the overall security posture but also aids in achieving compliance
  with industry standards and regulatory requirements by ensuring that data is consistently
  and accurately protected based on its sensitivity classification.
