title: Ensure Export Destinations are Configured for Private Networking
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that export destinations are configured for private networking
  is crucial to protect sensitive compliance data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. By restricting data exports to private networks, organizations can enhance
  their security posture, reduce exposure to external threats, and ensure compliance
  with stringent data protection regulations, ultimately safeguarding business integrity
  and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether export destinations within the IBM Cloud Security
  Compliance Center are configured to utilize private networking. By enforcing this
  configuration, data traffic is confined to secure, internal network paths, minimizing
  the risk of interception or exposure to public networks. Implementing private networking
  for export destinations not only strengthens the security framework but also aligns
  with best practices in network access control, facilitating adherence to compliance
  standards and reducing the likelihood of data leaks.
