rule_id: ibm.security_compliance_center.classification.policy_blocks_public_for_sensitive
title: Enforce Sensitive Data Protection by Blocking Public Access
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access is paramount in maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of business operations. Public exposure of sensitive
  information can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
  Ensuring that sensitive data is not publicly accessible mitigates these risks and
  supports compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule mandates that any sensitive data classification within the
  IBM Cloud Security Compliance Center must have policies that prevent public access.
  It checks for configurations that would allow sensitive data to be publicly accessible
  and enforces restrictions to safeguard such data. By implementing this rule, organizations
  can ensure that sensitive data is adequately protected from unauthorized access,
  reducing the risk of data breaches and aligning with industry compliance standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
