rule_id: ibm.security_compliance_center.classification.auto_classification_enabled_where_supported
title: Ensure Auto Classification is Enabled for Data Protection
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling auto classification for data protection is crucial for maintaining
  robust security and compliance with regulatory requirements. It helps organizations
  automatically categorize and protect sensitive data, minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. This proactive measure ensures that data is consistently
  classified according to its sensitivity, which aids in enforcing appropriate security
  controls and maintaining data privacy.
description: This rule checks whether auto classification is enabled for data resources
  where supported within the IBM Cloud Security Compliance Center. Enabling auto classification
  ensures that data is automatically categorized based on predefined criteria, which
  enhances the security posture by enforcing encryption and access controls tailored
  to the sensitivity of the data at rest. This automated approach not only strengthens
  data protection but also aids in achieving compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring consistent classification and protection of
  sensitive information.
