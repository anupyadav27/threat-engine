title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege in IBM Cloud Security Compliance Center
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege ensures that users and services
  have only the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks, minimizing
  the potential attack surface and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Inadequate
  access controls can lead to data breaches, regulatory compliance failures, and increased
  operational risk, potentially resulting in financial loss and reputational damage.
description: This rule evaluates the role-based access control (RBAC) configurations
  within the IBM Cloud Security Compliance Center to ensure that the least privilege
  principle is effectively enforced. It checks for overly permissive roles and unnecessary
  access rights granted to users and services. By aligning access permissions with
  job responsibilities, this rule enhances the security posture by preventing unauthorized
  actions that could compromise sensitive data or disrupt operations. Ensuring compliance
  with this rule contributes to adhering to industry standards and regulatory requirements,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, supporting overall governance and risk management strategies.
