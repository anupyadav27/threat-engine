rule_id: ibm.cognos_dashboard.analytics_dashboard.data_sharing_restricted_to_org
title: Restrict Data Sharing in Analytics Dashboard to Organization
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that data sharing is restricted to within the organization is
  crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive business
  information. Unauthorized data sharing can lead to data breaches, compromising intellectual
  property and customer trust, and can have significant legal and financial repercussions
  for the organization.
description: This rule verifies that data sharing within the IBM Cognos Analytics
  Dashboard is limited to members of the organization. By enforcing this restriction,
  the rule helps prevent unauthorized access and dissemination of sensitive data,
  thereby enhancing data protection and privacy. This measure aligns with encryption
  at rest policies, ensuring that data remains secure not only during storage but
  also when it is accessed or shared. Implementing such restrictions is essential
  for achieving compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements related
  to data protection and privacy.
