title: Enforce Data Export Controls in Cognos Analytics Dashboards
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling data export controls in Cognos Analytics Dashboards is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access and data leakage.
  By enforcing these controls, organizations can ensure that only authorized users
  can export data, thus protecting intellectual property and maintaining compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that data export controls are enabled in
  the Cognos Analytics Dashboard service. By enforcing this setting, organizations
  can restrict the ability to export sensitive data, thus minimizing the risk of data
  breaches and unauthorized dissemination of information. This control not only enhances
  the security posture of the analytics environment but also aids in meeting compliance
  requirements related to data protection and privacy, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by
  ensuring data is encrypted at rest and during export processes.
