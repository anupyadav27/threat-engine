title: Disable Public Embeds on Cognos Analytics Dashboards
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling public embeds for Cognos Analytics dashboards is crucial for
  preventing unauthorized data access and ensuring sensitive information is not inadvertently
  exposed to the public internet. This measure mitigates the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized data manipulation, which can have significant financial and reputational
  repercussions for businesses.
description: This rule checks if public embedding of Cognos Analytics dashboards is
  disabled, reinforcing the security of analytics data by restricting access to authenticated
  users only. By enforcing this rule, organizations can better control who views and
  interacts with their data, aligning with best practices in identity and access management.
  Implementing this restriction enhances data confidentiality, prevents unauthorized
  sharing, and supports compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data
  protection regulations.
