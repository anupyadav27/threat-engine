rule_id: ibm.cognos_dashboard.analytics_dashboard.data_sso_required
title: Enforce SSO for Enhanced Data Security in Cognos Analytics Dashboard
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO) for access to Cognos Analytics Dashboards
  enhances security by ensuring that data access is managed through a centralized
  authentication mechanism. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches, thereby maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
  business insights.
description: This rule mandates that Single Sign-On (SSO) is required for accessing
  data within the Cognos Analytics Dashboard on IBM Cloud. By enforcing SSO, all access
  requests are authenticated through a unified identity provider, which simplifies
  user management and strengthens security by minimizing the attack surface. This
  requirement aligns with data protection and privacy regulations, ensuring that data
  encryption at rest is complemented by secure access controls. Implementing SSO reduces
  administrative overhead and aids compliance with industry standards by providing
  a streamlined and secure authentication process.
