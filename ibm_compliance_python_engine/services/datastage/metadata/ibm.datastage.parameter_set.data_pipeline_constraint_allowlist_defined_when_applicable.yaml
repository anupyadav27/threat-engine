title: Ensure Allowlist for Data Pipeline Constraints in IBM DataStage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Defining an allowlist for data pipeline constraints is crucial to controlling
  and limiting access to sensitive data within the IBM DataStage environment. This
  practice minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  safeguarding data integrity and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.
  Properly configured allowlists ensure that only authorized entities can execute
  specific data operations, reducing exposure to security threats.
description: This rule checks whether a data pipeline constraint allowlist is defined
  and implemented in IBM DataStage when applicable. An allowlist restricts data pipeline
  operations to a predefined set of parameters, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized
  data manipulation and access. By enforcing allowlist configurations, organizations
  can align with industry standards for data encryption at rest, ensuring that sensitive
  data is protected against unauthorized access and modification. This control also
  aids in demonstrating compliance with regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, by ensuring robust data protection mechanisms are in place.
