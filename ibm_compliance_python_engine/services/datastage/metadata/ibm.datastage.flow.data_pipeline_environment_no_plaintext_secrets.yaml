rule_id: ibm.datastage.flow.data_pipeline_environment_no_plaintext_secrets
title: Ensure DataStage Pipeline Environments Do Not Contain Plaintext Secrets
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Storing secrets in plaintext within data pipeline environments poses a
  significant security risk as it can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
  Protecting secrets through encryption ensures that sensitive information such as
  API keys, passwords, and tokens remain confidential, maintaining the integrity of
  data operations and complying with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that no plaintext secrets are stored within IBM DataStage
  pipeline environments. By enforcing the use of encryption for secrets, it ensures
  that sensitive data is protected both at rest and during processing. Implementing
  this rule enhances overall security posture by preventing potential exposure of
  sensitive information, thereby aligning with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  for data protection and privacy.
