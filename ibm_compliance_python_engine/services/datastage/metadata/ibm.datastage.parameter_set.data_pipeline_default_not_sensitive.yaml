rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_default_not_sensitive
title: Ensure DataStage Parameter Sets Default to Non-Sensitive Data Configuration
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: This rule is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and
  data breaches by ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed.
  By configuring parameter sets in DataStage to default to non-sensitive settings,
  organizations can better protect sensitive data, maintain compliance with data protection
  regulations, and reduce potential reputational and financial impacts from data leakage.
description: This rule checks that parameter sets within IBM Cloud DataStage are configured
  to default to non-sensitive data settings. By enforcing this default configuration,
  organizations can ensure that any parameterized connections or data pipelines do
  not inadvertently expose sensitive information. This enhances the overall security
  posture by mitigating the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data
  protection standards and regulations. Implementing this rule helps organizations
  demonstrate due diligence in protecting data at rest, aligning with best practices
  in cloud security management.
