rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_metadata_values_not_plaintext_secret
title: Protect Data Pipeline Metadata from Plaintext Secrets in IBM DataStage
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that data pipeline metadata values are not stored as plaintext
  secrets is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access
  and potential breaches. This practice helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity
  of data, reducing the risk of data leakage and ensuring compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that metadata values within IBM DataStage
  parameter sets are not stored as plaintext secrets. By enforcing encryption of metadata
  at rest, it enhances the security posture by preventing exposure of sensitive information.
  This measure not only protects against unauthorized access but also aligns with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy,
  such as GDPR and CCPA, thereby ensuring comprehensive compliance.
