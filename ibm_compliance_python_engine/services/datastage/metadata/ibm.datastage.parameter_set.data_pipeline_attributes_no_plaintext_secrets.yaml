rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_attributes_no_plaintext_secrets
title: Secure Parameter Handling in DataStage Pipelines
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that secrets and sensitive data are not stored in plaintext within
  DataStage pipelines is critical for protecting against unauthorized access and data
  breaches. Encrypting sensitive information helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality,
  minimizing the risk of exposure to malicious actors and ensuring compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all parameter sets within IBM DataStage pipelines
  are configured to handle secrets securely, without storing them in plaintext. By
  enforcing encryption at rest for sensitive data, the rule strengthens the security
  posture of your data processing workflows. This not only helps prevent unauthorized
  access but also aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  for data protection, such as GDPR and HIPAA, enhancing the overall compliance of
  your cloud environment.
