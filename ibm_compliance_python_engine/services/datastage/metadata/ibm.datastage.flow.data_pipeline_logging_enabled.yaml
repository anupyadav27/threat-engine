rule_id: ibm.datastage.flow.data_pipeline_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Data Pipeline Logging is Enabled in IBM DataStage
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for data pipelines in IBM DataStage is vital for maintaining
  an auditable record of data processing activities. This practice aids in detecting
  unauthorized access, identifying anomalies, and ensuring accountability, which is
  crucial for compliance with industry regulations and standards.
description: This rule verifies that logging is activated for data pipelines within
  IBM DataStage. By ensuring data pipeline logging is enabled, organizations can capture
  detailed records of data flow activities. This enhances security by providing visibility
  into data operations and supports compliance efforts by maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail. Moreover, it assists in the quick detection and investigation of suspicious
  activities, thereby mitigating potential security incidents.
