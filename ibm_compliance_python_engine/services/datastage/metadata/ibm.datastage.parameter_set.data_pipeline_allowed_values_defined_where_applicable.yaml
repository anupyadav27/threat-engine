rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_allowed_values_defined_where_applicable
title: Ensure Data Pipeline Parameters Have Defined Allowed Values
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Defining allowed values for data pipeline parameters is crucial to maintain
  data integrity and prevent unauthorized data manipulation, which can lead to potential
  data breaches. By restricting parameter values, organizations can enforce consistent
  data processing rules, reducing the risk of errors and enhancing compliance with
  data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that all applicable parameter sets within IBM DataStage
  pipelines have defined allowed values. Implementing this security measure ensures
  that only predetermined, valid inputs are accepted by the data processing workflows,
  thereby minimizing the risk of data corruption or unauthorized access. Additionally,
  this practice supports encryption at rest by ensuring that data processed through
  pipelines adheres to defined security standards, contributing to overall data protection
  and privacy. Adhering to this rule aids in meeting regulatory compliance and industry
  standards for data security.
