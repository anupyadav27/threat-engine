rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_type_set
title: Ensure Data Pipeline Type is Configured for DataStage Parameter Sets
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Proper configuration of data pipeline types in IBM DataStage is crucial
  for ensuring that data is processed securely and efficiently. Misconfigured pipelines
  can lead to vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access or data
  breaches. By setting the data pipeline type correctly, organizations can comply
  with data protection regulations and maintain the confidentiality and integrity
  of their data.
description: This rule checks whether the data pipeline type is properly set for parameter
  sets in IBM DataStage. By enforcing this configuration, the rule ensures that data
  moving through the pipeline is encrypted at rest, thus preventing unauthorized access
  during processing. This enhances the security posture of the data processing environment
  and assists in meeting compliance requirements for data protection and privacy standards.
  Ensuring encryption at rest aligns with best practices for data security and helps
  organizations mitigate risks associated with data leakage and non-compliance.
