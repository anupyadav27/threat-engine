title: Ensure DataStage Job Pipeline Uses KMS Encryption for Data Protection
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for DataStage job pipelines
  is critical to safeguarding sensitive data. This measure prevents unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches by ensuring that all data at rest is encrypted using
  secure keys. It also aligns with regulatory compliance requirements, reducing the
  risk of costly penalties and reputational damage.
description: This security rule verifies that DataStage job pipelines leverage IBM
  Key Management Service to encrypt data at rest. By enabling KMS encryption, organizations
  enhance their data protection capabilities, ensuring that only authorized entities
  can decrypt and access the data. This practice not only fortifies data privacy but
  also supports compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which
  mandate robust encryption protocols to protect sensitive information.
