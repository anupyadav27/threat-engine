rule_id: ibm.datastage.job.data_definition_storage_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for DataStage Job Data Definition Storage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that DataStage job data definitions are encrypted is critical
  for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. Encryption at rest helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity,
  reducing the risk of data exfiltration and aligning with regulatory compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that all data definitions associated with IBM Cloud
  DataStage jobs are encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption, the rule ensures
  that sensitive job configurations, metadata, and associated data are protected using
  strong cryptographic algorithms. Implementing encryption at rest enhances the overall
  security posture by safeguarding data against unauthorized access and contributing
  to compliance with industry standards and regulatory mandates. Compliance with this
  rule demonstrates a commitment to data protection and privacy best practices.
