title: Enforce Immutability of Data Definition Versions in DataStage Jobs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing immutability on data definition versions within DataStage jobs
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that historical data and
  configurations are preserved. This practice helps prevent unauthorized or accidental
  modifications, which could lead to data corruption or compliance violations, thereby
  protecting the organization from potential data breaches and financial penalties.
description: This rule ensures that data definition versions in DataStage jobs are
  immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once created. The system checks that all
  data definitions and associated versions are locked to prevent unauthorized changes.
  By enforcing immutability, this rule enhances security by maintaining historical
  integrity, facilitates auditing processes, and ensures compliance with data protection
  regulations. This approach reduces risks associated with data tampering and enhances
  the reliability of data processing workflows.
