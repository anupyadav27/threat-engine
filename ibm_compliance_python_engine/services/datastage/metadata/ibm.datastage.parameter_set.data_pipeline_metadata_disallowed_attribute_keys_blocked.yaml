rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_metadata_disallowed_attribute_keys_blocked
title: Secure Data Pipeline Metadata by Blocking Disallowed Attribute Keys
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Blocking disallowed attribute keys in data pipeline metadata is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By enforcing strict
  controls over metadata attributes, organizations can protect sensitive information,
  maintain data integrity, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations,
  which ultimately safeguards business reputation and minimizes legal risks.
description: This rule ensures that DataStage parameter sets do not contain metadata
  attribute keys that are deemed insecure or disallowed. By implementing this check,
  organizations can prevent the misuse of metadata that might lead to unauthorized
  data access or leakage. This enhances the security of data at rest by ensuring that
  all data pipeline components adhere to strict encryption and access control policies.
  Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry standards for data protection
  and privacy, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that metadata handling aligns with
  established security best practices.
