title: Enforce Data Pipeline Constraint Patterns for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Defining constraint patterns for data pipelines in IBM DataStage ensures
  that sensitive data is adequately protected against unauthorized access and misuse.
  This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and privacy, particularly when handling
  sensitive or regulated data, thereby minimizing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This security rule checks for the presence of defined constraint patterns
  in parameter sets associated with IBM DataStage data pipelines. By enforcing constraint
  patterns, organizations can ensure that data is processed according to predefined
  security and privacy guidelines, reducing the risk of unintended data exposure.
  Implementing this rule supports compliance with industry standards and regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data protection controls.
