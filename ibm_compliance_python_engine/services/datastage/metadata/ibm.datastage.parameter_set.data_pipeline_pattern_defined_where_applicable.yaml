rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_pattern_defined_where_applicable
title: Ensure Data Pipeline Patterns Are Defined for Parameter Sets
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Defining data pipeline patterns for parameter sets in IBM Cloud Datastage
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security. It ensures that data flows
  adhere to predefined configurations that are consistent, reliable, and secure, mitigating
  risks such as data breaches and unauthorized access. A well-defined pipeline pattern
  promotes organizational compliance with data protection regulations, reducing liability
  and potential financial penalties.
description: This rule checks that parameter sets within IBM Cloud Datastage have
  defined data pipeline patterns where applicable. By ensuring that data flows are
  governed by established patterns, organizations can enforce encryption at rest,
  safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access. This practice not only
  enhances data security but also aligns with compliance frameworks and industry standards,
  facilitating audit processes and maintaining trust with stakeholders.
