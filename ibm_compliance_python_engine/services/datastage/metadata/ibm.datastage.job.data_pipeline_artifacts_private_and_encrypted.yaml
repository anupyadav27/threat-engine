title: Ensure DataStage Job Artifacts Are Private and Encrypted at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting data pipeline artifacts in IBM Cloud DataStage by ensuring they
  are private and encrypted at rest is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity. This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data
  breaches, which can lead to severe financial penalties and reputational damage for
  organizations. It also aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  for data protection.
description: This rule checks that all data pipeline artifacts associated with IBM
  DataStage jobs are stored privately and encrypted when at rest. Encryption at rest
  ensures that stored data is not easily readable by unauthorized individuals, enhancing
  the overall security posture of the data processing environment. By enforcing privacy
  and encryption, organizations can demonstrate compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby minimizing legal risks and maintaining customer
  trust.
