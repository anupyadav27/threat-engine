title: Enforce Least Privilege for DataStage Pipeline Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for DataStage pipeline execution
  roles is critical to minimizing security risks. Overprivileged access can lead to
  unauthorized data exposure or manipulation, which could result in data breaches,
  compliance violations, and financial penalties. By ensuring that roles have only
  the necessary permissions, organizations can better protect sensitive data and maintain
  trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule evaluates whether roles assigned to DataStage pipeline executions
  adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks if roles are assigned only
  the permissions necessary for executing specific data pipeline tasks, thereby reducing
  potential attack vectors. Adhering to least privilege principles enhances the security
  posture by limiting access to sensitive data and functions, aligning with compliance
  frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, and ensuring that only authorized actions can
  be performed within the DataStage environment.
