rule_id: ibm.datastage.flow.data_pipeline_network_private_only
title: Enforce Private Network for DataStage Data Pipelines Only
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that DataStage data pipelines operate solely within a private
  network is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and
  potential breaches. By restricting data flow to private networks, organizations
  can significantly reduce their exposure to external threats and comply with stringent
  data privacy regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all DataStage data pipeline flows are configured
  to use only private networks, preventing public internet exposure. This configuration
  enhances security by ensuring that data exchanges occur within a secure, controlled
  environment, reducing the likelihood of interception or unauthorized access. Adhering
  to this rule supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements,
  thereby protecting organizational data integrity and customer trust.
