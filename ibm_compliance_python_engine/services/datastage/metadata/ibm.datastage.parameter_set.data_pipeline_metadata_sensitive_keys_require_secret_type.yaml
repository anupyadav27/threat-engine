rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_metadata_sensitive_keys_require_secret_type
title: Enforce Secret Type for Sensitive Keys in DataStage Metadata
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that sensitive keys within DataStage metadata are designated as
  secret types is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. This
  practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access, thereby safeguarding sensitive
  information against potential breaches, which could lead to significant financial
  and reputational damage.
description: This security rule mandates that sensitive keys within DataStage parameter
  sets must be classified as secret types. By enforcing this requirement, the rule
  ensures that sensitive metadata is encrypted at rest, reducing vulnerabilities associated
  with data exposure. Compliance with this rule not only enhances data protection
  efforts but also aligns with industry standards and regulations, providing organizations
  with a robust framework for managing sensitive information securely.
