title: Ensure Runtime Resolution of Data Pipeline Binding Secrets in IBM DataStage
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Resolving secret references at runtime is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and confidentiality within IBM DataStage pipelines. This practice prevents
  unauthorized access to sensitive data by ensuring that secrets are not exposed during
  design time, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.
  Implementing runtime resolution aligns with best practices for data protection and
  strengthens the overall security posture of your data processing environment.
description: This rule checks that secret references within IBM DataStage parameter
  sets are configured to be resolved at runtime rather than at design time. By enforcing
  runtime resolution, sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials
  remains encrypted and inaccessible until the data pipeline is executed. This approach
  not only enhances security by minimizing the attack surface but also supports compliance
  with regulations that mandate data encryption and proper access controls. Ensuring
  that secret references are handled securely helps protect against unauthorized data
  exposure and aligns with organizational policies for data protection and privacy.
