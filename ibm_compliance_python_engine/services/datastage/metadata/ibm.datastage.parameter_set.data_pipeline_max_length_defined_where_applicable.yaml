title: Enforce Data Pipeline Max Length for Secure Parameter Sets in DataStage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Defining the maximum length of data pipelines within IBM DataStage is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized data access and potential breaches. This ensures that data
  movement is controlled and monitored, safeguarding sensitive information from exposure
  and maintaining data integrity. Adhering to this rule helps organizations mitigate
  risks related to data leaks and enhances compliance with data protection standards.
description: This rule verifies that the maximum length for data pipelines is defined
  wherever applicable within IBM DataStage's parameter set. By setting a maximum length,
  organizations can enforce stricter control over data flows, thereby reducing the
  risk of data spillage and ensuring that only permissible data volumes are processed.
  This measure is vital for maintaining encryption at rest, as it minimizes the likelihood
  of large, unencrypted data sets being exposed. Implementing this control enhances
  overall security posture and aids in achieving compliance with data protection and
  privacy regulations.
