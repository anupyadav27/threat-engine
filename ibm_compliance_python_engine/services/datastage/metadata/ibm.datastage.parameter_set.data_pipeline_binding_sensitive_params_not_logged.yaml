rule_id: ibm.datastage.parameter_set.data_pipeline_binding_sensitive_params_not_logged
title: Ensure Sensitive Parameters in Data Pipelines Are Not Logged
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Logging of sensitive parameters in data pipeline executions can lead to
  unauthorized access to confidential information, risking data breaches and non-compliance
  with data protection regulations. By ensuring sensitive parameters are not logged,
  organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain customer trust.
description: This rule checks that sensitive parameters associated with DataStage
  data pipeline bindings are not recorded in logs. By excluding sensitive parameters
  from logs, organizations enhance their security posture by reducing the risk of
  sensitive data exposure. This practice supports compliance with standards like GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personal and sensitive information. Implementing
  this rule helps maintain a secure logging environment while ensuring that sensitive
  data remains confidential.
