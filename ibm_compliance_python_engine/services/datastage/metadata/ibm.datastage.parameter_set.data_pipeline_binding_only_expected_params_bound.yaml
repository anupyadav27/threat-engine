title: Ensure DataStage Pipelines Bind Only Expected Parameters
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing strict parameter binding within IBM DataStage pipelines is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data leakage. By ensuring that
  only expected parameters are bound, organizations can mitigate risks associated
  with accidental data exposure or malicious parameter injection, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive data and maintaining business integrity.
description: This rule checks that IBM DataStage pipelines bind only the parameters
  that are explicitly expected and defined within the parameter set. Such a configuration
  enhances security by reducing the attack surface, as it prevents unanticipated parameters
  from being injected into the data processing workflows. By strictly adhering to
  this practice, organizations align with best practices for data protection and encryption
  at rest, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. This
  contributes to a strong security posture and fosters trust with stakeholders.
