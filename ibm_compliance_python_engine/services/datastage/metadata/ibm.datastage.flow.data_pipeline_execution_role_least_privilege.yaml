rule_id: ibm.datastage.flow.data_pipeline_execution_role_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Pipeline Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that data pipeline execution roles in IBM Cloud's DataStage only
  have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks is critical to minimizing
  security risks. Over-privileged roles can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches,
  potentially causing significant business and reputational harm. Implementing least
  privilege principles strengthens the overall security posture by reducing the attack
  surface.
description: This rule mandates that roles associated with the execution of data pipelines
  in IBM Cloud DataStage adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks that
  roles do not possess excessive permissions beyond what is required for their specific
  operational tasks. By enforcing least privilege, this rule mitigates the risk of
  unauthorized access and data exposure, thus aligning with best practices in identity
  and access management. Compliance with this rule helps organizations meet regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring access controls are appropriately
  restrictive.
