title: Ensure Data Pipeline Constraint Max Length is Defined in IBM DataStage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Specifying a maximum length for data pipeline parameters in IBM DataStage
  is crucial for preventing buffer overflow attacks and ensuring data integrity. This
  practice helps avoid unauthorized data access and manipulation, thus maintaining
  compliance with data protection regulations and minimizing potential business disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that a maximum length is defined for applicable parameters
  within IBM DataStage parameter sets. By establishing constraints, the rule mitigates
  the risk of overflow vulnerabilities, which can lead to unauthorized data access
  or corruption. Implementing such constraints is integral to maintaining encryption
  at rest, ensuring that sensitive data is stored securely. Additionally, this practice
  supports adherence to organizational and regulatory compliance requirements, enhancing
  overall data security posture.
