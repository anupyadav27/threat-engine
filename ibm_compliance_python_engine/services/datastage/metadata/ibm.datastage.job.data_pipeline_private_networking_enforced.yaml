title: Enforce Private Networking for IBM DataStage Data Pipelines
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for DataStage data pipelines is crucial to
  ensure that sensitive data processing occurs within a secure and controlled environment.
  This measure minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting
  network access to only trusted and predefined network paths. By ensuring data pipelines
  operate in a private network, organizations can achieve better compliance with data
  protection regulations and enhance their overall security posture.
description: This rule checks whether IBM DataStage jobs are configured to use private
  networking, preventing exposure to public networks. By enforcing this configuration,
  data transfers and processing occur over secure, internal networks, thereby reducing
  the attack surface. This setup not only protects data integrity and confidentiality
  but also aligns with compliance frameworks that mandate secure data handling practices.
  Implementing private networking for DataStage jobs enhances security by ensuring
  that only authorized resources within your IBM Cloud environment can access and
  interact with your data pipelines.
