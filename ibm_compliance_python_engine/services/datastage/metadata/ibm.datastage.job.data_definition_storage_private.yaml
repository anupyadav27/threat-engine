title: Ensure DataStage Job Data Definition Storage is Private
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that DataStage job data definitions are stored privately is crucial
  to maintaining data confidentiality and integrity within the IBM Cloud environment.
  By restricting access to these definitions, organizations can mitigate the risk
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive
  business information and adhering to compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks whether DataStage job data definitions are stored in
  a private network environment, ensuring that only authorized users within the organization
  can access them. Implementing private storage for these definitions enhances security
  by limiting exposure to external threats and reducing the attack surface. This practice
  not only fortifies network security but also supports compliance with industry standards
  and regulations that mandate restricted access to sensitive data.
