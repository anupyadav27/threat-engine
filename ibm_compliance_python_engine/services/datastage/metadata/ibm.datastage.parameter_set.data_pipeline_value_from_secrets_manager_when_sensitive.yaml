title: Secure Sensitive Data with Secrets Manager in IBM DataStage Pipelines
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Utilizing IBM Secrets Manager for managing sensitive parameters in DataStage
  pipelines is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and
  potential breaches. This practice ensures compliance with data protection regulations,
  enhances trust with stakeholders, and reduces the risk of data leaks that could
  lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that any sensitive data parameters within IBM DataStage
  pipelines are sourced from IBM Secrets Manager. By doing so, it ensures that sensitive
  information, such as API keys, passwords, and confidential data, is encrypted at
  rest and only accessible through secure channels. This approach not only fortifies
  the security posture of your data pipelines but also aligns with industry best practices
  and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy.
