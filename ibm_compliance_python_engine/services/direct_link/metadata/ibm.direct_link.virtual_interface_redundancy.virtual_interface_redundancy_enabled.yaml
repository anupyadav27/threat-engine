title: Ensure Virtual Interface Redundancy for IBM Direct Link
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Enabling virtual interface redundancy in IBM Direct Link is crucial for
  maintaining service availability and minimizing downtime in the event of a failure.
  It provides a failover mechanism that ensures continuous connectivity and operational
  resilience, which is vital for business continuity and disaster recovery strategies.
description: This security rule ensures that virtual interface redundancy is enabled
  for IBM Direct Link connections, thereby enhancing the resilience of network services.
  By configuring redundant virtual interfaces, enterprises can prevent single points
  of failure and maintain uninterrupted data flow even if one connection fails. This
  configuration aligns with best practices for disaster recovery and contributes to
  compliance with industry standards by safeguarding against potential network outages
  and data loss.
