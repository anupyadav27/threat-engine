title: Ensure Redundancy in IBM Cloud Direct Link Connections
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Enabling connection redundancy in IBM Cloud Direct Link is crucial for
  maintaining high availability and ensuring business continuity. In the event of
  a failure in a primary connection, redundant connections provide an alternative
  path, minimizing downtime and service disruption, which can lead to significant
  business and operational losses.
description: This rule verifies that redundancy is enabled for IBM Cloud Direct Link
  connections. By implementing redundant connections, organizations can achieve greater
  resilience and disaster recovery capabilities. Redundancy ensures that even if one
  connection fails, traffic can be rerouted through an alternative path, maintaining
  continuous connectivity and service availability. This not only strengthens the
  security posture by preventing single points of failure but also aligns with compliance
  requirements for business continuity planning and risk management.
