title: Ensure Stream Encryption at Rest is Enabled for Log Analysis Views
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling stream encryption at rest for log analysis views is crucial to
  protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This security
  measure ensures that data stored within IBM Cloud’s log analysis service is encrypted,
  safeguarding it from malicious actors and aligning with industry best practices
  for data protection. Failure to implement encryption at rest can lead to data exposure,
  resulting in financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance with regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule verifies that stream encryption at rest is enabled for log
  analysis views within IBM Cloud. By checking this configuration, the rule ensures
  that all log data stored is encrypted using robust encryption algorithms. This enhances
  the overall security posture by protecting data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. Moreover, enabling encryption at rest aids in meeting various regulatory
  compliance requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection laws, thus
  mitigating legal risks and maintaining customer trust.
