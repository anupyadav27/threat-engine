title: Ensure Least Privilege for Log Analysis Destination Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing least privilege for log analysis destination targets is crucial
  for minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that only necessary permissions are granted, organizations can protect sensitive
  data and maintain compliance with security standards, thereby reducing business
  risks and safeguarding customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that access permissions for log analysis destination
  targets are configured according to the principle of least privilege. It checks
  that only users or services with a legitimate need are granted the appropriate level
  of access necessary to perform their job functions. By implementing this rule, organizations
  enhance their security posture by reducing the attack surface and ensuring compliance
  with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2, which require stringent access
  controls and audit logging.
