rule_id: ibm.log_analysis.view.storage_encrypted
title: Ensure Storage Encryption for Log Analysis Views
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting storage for log analysis views is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access. Unencrypted data at rest can be vulnerable to
  breaches, potentially leading to data leaks, legal repercussions, and damage to
  reputation. By enforcing encryption, organizations can ensure compliance with various
  data protection regulations and standards, enhancing both security posture and customer
  trust.
description: This security rule checks whether storage associated with IBM Cloud Log
  Analysis views is encrypted at rest. Specifically, it verifies that data is protected
  using robust encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized access. Encrypting data
  at rest mitigates risks from data breaches and unauthorized physical access to storage
  devices. Adhering to this rule helps organizations align with industry best practices
  and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, thereby reducing
  the risk of legal and financial penalties.
