rule_id: ibm.log_analysis.target.destination_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Log Analysis Target Destinations
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the destination of log analysis data is critical to protecting
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and tampering. Ensuring that data
  is encrypted at rest mitigates the risk of data breaches, which can lead to financial
  loss and reputational damage. This practice is essential for complying with industry
  regulations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that log analysis target destinations within IBM Cloud
  are configured to use encryption for data at rest. By enforcing encryption, this
  rule enhances the overall security posture by safeguarding stored log data from
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Encryption at rest is a fundamental
  component of data protection strategies, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, and it provides a robust defense against malicious actors
  attempting to exploit unencrypted data.
