title: Ensure Private Networking for Log Analysis Destination Endpoint
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring destination endpoints to use private networking within IBM
  Cloud Log Analysis enhances security by reducing exposure to public internet threats.
  By ensuring traffic remains within the IBM Cloud environment, the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized access is significantly minimized, thereby protecting sensitive
  log data and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that destination endpoints for IBM Cloud Log Analysis
  are configured to utilize private networking. By enforcing private network connectivity,
  sensitive log data is confined to a secure, internal network, effectively reducing
  the attack surface. This configuration not only strengthens data protection by limiting
  potential eavesdropping and interception but also aligns with industry best practices
  for network security and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
