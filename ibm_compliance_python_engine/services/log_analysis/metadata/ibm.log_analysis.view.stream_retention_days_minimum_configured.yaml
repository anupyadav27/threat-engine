title: Ensure Minimum Stream Retention Days Configured for Log Analysis
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for log data is crucial for auditing
  and compliance purposes. It ensures that critical log information is preserved for
  sufficient time to facilitate forensic investigations and compliance audits, thereby
  supporting incident response and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether a minimum number of days is configured for retaining
  log streams in the IBM Cloud Log Analysis service. By enforcing a retention baseline,
  organizations can ensure that log data is available for review and analysis over
  an adequate period. This practice not only enhances security posture by enabling
  thorough investigation capabilities but also aligns with compliance frameworks that
  mandate specific data retention standards. Properly configured retention policies
  help in maintaining the integrity and availability of log data, which is essential
  for audit logging and monitoring activities.
