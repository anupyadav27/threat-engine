title: Ensure Least Privilege for Log Analysis Destination IAM Policies
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for IAM policies in IBM Cloud's
  Log Analysis service minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive log
  data, reducing potential security breaches. This approach not only safeguards critical
  information but also helps maintain compliance with industry regulations and organizational
  security policies, thereby avoiding potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks IAM policies associated with destination targets in
  the IBM Cloud Log Analysis service to ensure they are configured with the least
  privilege necessary. By restricting access permissions to the minimum required for
  functionality, the rule enhances the security posture by reducing the attack surface.
  Compliance with this rule supports adherence to best practices in identity and access
  management, promoting robust security and alignment with regulatory standards.
