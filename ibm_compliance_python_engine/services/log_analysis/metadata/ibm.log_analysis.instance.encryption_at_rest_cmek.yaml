title: Log Analysis Instance Encryption at Rest with CMEK
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that log data is encrypted at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. It protects
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and aligns with regulatory compliance
  requirements, minimizing the risk of data breaches and associated business impacts.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud Log Analysis instances utilize Customer-Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) for encrypting data at rest. By leveraging CMEK, organizations
  gain greater control and flexibility over their encryption keys, allowing them to
  meet stringent data protection policies and compliance mandates. Implementing CMEK
  enhances the security posture by ensuring that encryption keys are managed according
  to the organization's security policies, providing an additional layer of protection
  against unauthorized data access and potential regulatory non-compliance.
