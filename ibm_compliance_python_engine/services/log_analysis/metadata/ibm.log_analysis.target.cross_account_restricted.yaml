title: Restrict Cross-Account Access in IBM Cloud Log Analysis
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Restricting cross-account access in log analysis is crucial to maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Unauthorized access can lead
  to leakage of critical information, potentially causing financial loss and reputational
  damage. By enforcing this rule, organizations can ensure that only authorized users
  within their account have access to log data, supporting compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This rule checks for configurations in IBM Cloud Log Analysis that allow
  cross-account access to log data. Ensuring that log data is only accessible within
  the same account prevents unauthorized exposure of sensitive information to external
  entities. By restricting such access, businesses can enhance their security posture,
  mitigate risks of data breaches, and adhere to compliance standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. This rule serves as a preventive measure to protect organizational data
  integrity and confidentiality.
