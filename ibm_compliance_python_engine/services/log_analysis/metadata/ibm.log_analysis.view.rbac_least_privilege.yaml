title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for IBM Log Analysis View Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing RBAC Least Privilege in IBM Log Analysis ensures that users
  have the minimal access necessary to perform their job functions, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized data exposure and potential breaches. This principle is vital for
  maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, as excessive permissions can lead
  to inadvertent or malicious data misuse, impacting business operations and compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies for
  IBM Log Analysis are configured to grant the least privilege necessary for viewing
  logs. It checks for any over-permissioned roles that could lead to unauthorized
  viewing of sensitive logs. By enforcing least privilege, organizations can significantly
  enhance their security posture by limiting potential attack vectors and ensuring
  compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict
  access controls to sensitive information.
