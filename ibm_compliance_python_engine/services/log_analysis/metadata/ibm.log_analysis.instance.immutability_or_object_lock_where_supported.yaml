rule_id: ibm.log_analysis.instance.immutability_or_object_lock_where_supported
title: Enforce Immutability or Object Lock for Log Analysis Instances
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Implementing immutability or object lock on log analysis instances is crucial
  for preserving the integrity and authenticity of logs, which are vital for forensic
  investigations and compliance audits. It mitigates the risk of unauthorized modifications
  or deletions, ensuring that logs are reliable and can be used to identify security
  incidents and fulfill regulatory requirements.
description: This rule ensures that log analysis instances in IBM Cloud are configured
  with immutability or object lock where supported. The configuration is validated
  to prevent unauthorized alterations, deletions, or overwriting of logs. By enforcing
  immutability, organizations can maintain a secure, tamper-proof logging environment,
  thereby enhancing the reliability of audit logs and aligning with compliance standards
  such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA. This setup not only strengthens the security posture
  but also provides a robust mechanism for maintaining data integrity and ensuring
  accountability.
