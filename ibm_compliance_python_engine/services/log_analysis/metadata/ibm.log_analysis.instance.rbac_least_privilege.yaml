title: Enforce Least Privilege in IBM Log Analysis RBAC Configurations
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) configurations for IBM Log Analysis is critical to minimizing security risks.
  It ensures that users have only the necessary permissions to perform their job functions,
  thus reducing the potential for accidental or malicious data exposure. This approach
  helps protect sensitive log data, which is vital for maintaining the integrity and
  confidentiality of business operations.
description: This rule evaluates the RBAC settings for IBM Log Analysis instances
  to ensure that only the minimum necessary permissions are assigned to users. By
  enforcing least privilege, organizations can prevent unauthorized access and potential
  misuse of log data. This practice not only enhances security by limiting user actions
  but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
  Regular audits of RBAC configurations can help maintain a secure and compliant cloud
  environment.
