title: Ensure Minimum Retention Days for Log Analysis Instances
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for log data is crucial for maintaining
  security and compliance within an organization. It ensures that logs are available
  for a sufficient period to support forensic investigations and helps with compliance
  to regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, which may mandate data retention
  periods. Insufficient log retention can hinder incident response and auditing capabilities,
  potentially leading to security breaches going unnoticed.
description: This rule checks whether the log analysis service instances in IBM Cloud
  have a minimum retention period configured. By enforcing a minimum retention period,
  organizations can ensure that log data is preserved for a specific duration, facilitating
  comprehensive auditing and monitoring. This practice enhances security posture by
  enabling detailed incident investigations and supports compliance frameworks that
  require logs to be retained for a certain period. Implementing this configuration
  helps prevent the premature deletion of critical log data, thus maintaining the
  integrity and availability of audit trails.
