rule_id: ibm.log_analysis.view.stream_ingestion_auth_required
title: Mandatory Authentication for Stream Ingestion in Log Analysis
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring authentication for stream ingestion in log analysis is critical
  for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of log data. Unauthorized access
  to log streams can lead to data breaches, enabling malicious actors to manipulate
  or exfiltrate sensitive information, which can have severe repercussions including
  financial loss and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that authentication mechanisms are enforced for stream
  ingestion within the IBM Cloud Log Analysis service. By requiring authentication,
  the rule ensures that only authorized users or services can access and ingest log
  data, thereby preventing unauthorized access and potential tampering of logs. Implementing
  this security measure enhances the overall security posture by safeguarding log
  data from unauthorized modifications and supports compliance with security standards
  and regulations that mandate audit logging and access controls.
