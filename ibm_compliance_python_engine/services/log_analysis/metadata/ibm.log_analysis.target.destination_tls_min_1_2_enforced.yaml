rule_id: ibm.log_analysis.target.destination_tls_min_1_2_enforced
title: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for Secure Log Destination in IBM Log Analysis
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing a minimum TLS version of 1.2 for log destination targets is crucial
  to ensure data protection by preventing downgrade attacks and mitigating vulnerabilities
  associated with older protocols. This rule is vital for maintaining the integrity
  and confidentiality of log data in transit, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  or data breaches, which can lead to substantial financial and reputational damage.
description: This security rule checks that all log data transmitted to destination
  targets within the IBM Log Analysis service enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher. By
  ensuring the use of up-to-date encryption protocols, this rule enhances the security
  of data in transit, aligning with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  for data protection. It helps organizations meet compliance standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate strong encryption methods for data security.
