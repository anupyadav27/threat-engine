rule_id: ibm.file_storage.resource.file_system_copy_tags_to_volumes_enabled
title: Ensure File System Tags are Copied to Volumes for Enhanced Traceability
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling the automatic copying of file system tags to volumes in IBM Cloud
  File Storage enhances traceability and accountability, ensuring that resource identification
  and tracking are consistent across the cloud environment. This practice reduces
  the risk of misconfiguration and unauthorized access, thereby supporting compliance
  with data governance and security policies.
description: This rule checks whether the file system tags are automatically copied
  to volumes in IBM Cloud File Storage. By ensuring that tags are consistently applied,
  organizations can maintain better visibility and control over their storage resources.
  This practice aids in the accurate classification and management of data, facilitating
  efficient audits and compliance with industry standards. Additionally, it supports
  the identification of security and operational issues by allowing for detailed resource
  tracking and management.
