title: Ensure Multi-AZ Enabled for Windows File System in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) for Windows file systems in IBM Cloud
  enhances data availability and disaster recovery capabilities. By distributing data
  across multiple availability zones, organizations can minimize downtime and data
  loss, ensuring business continuity and compliance with industry standards for resilience.
description: This rule verifies that Windows file systems within the IBM Cloud File
  Storage service are configured with Multi-AZ support. Multi-AZ deployment ensures
  that data is replicated across different availability zones, providing high availability
  and fault tolerance. This configuration is crucial for maintaining operational integrity
  and meeting various compliance requirements, such as those outlined in ISO/IEC 27001
  and other industry-specific regulations, by safeguarding against data center failures
  and ensuring seamless access to critical data.
