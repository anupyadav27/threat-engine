title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for IBM Cloud File Storage Shares
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for file storage shares is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption,
  data is vulnerable to theft, especially in multi-tenant environments where resources
  are shared. This measure not only safeguards data integrity and confidentiality
  but also helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and others.
description: This security rule checks whether encryption at rest is enabled for IBM
  Cloud File Storage shares. Encryption at rest ensures that the data stored in the
  file system is encrypted using secure cryptographic algorithms, making it unreadable
  to unauthorized users. Enforcing this rule enhances the overall security posture
  by protecting data against unauthorized access and data breaches. Additionally,
  it aids organizations in meeting regulatory compliance standards, which require
  stringent data protection measures.
