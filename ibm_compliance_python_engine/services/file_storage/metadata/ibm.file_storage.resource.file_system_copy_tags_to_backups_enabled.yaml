rule_id: ibm.file_storage.resource.file_system_copy_tags_to_backups_enabled
title: Ensure Tags on File System Copies Are Propagated to Backups
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling the propagation of tags from file system copies to backups is
  crucial for maintaining consistent metadata, which aids in effective resource management
  and cost tracking. It enhances security by ensuring that all backups are easily
  identifiable and categorized, facilitating quicker incident response and audit processes.
description: This rule verifies that when a file system is copied, its associated
  tags are also applied to its backups. By doing so, it ensures that metadata such
  as ownership, environment, and compliance requirements are preserved. This practice
  not only aids in organization and management but also aligns with compliance requirements
  by maintaining data lineage and integrity. Enabling this feature contributes to
  a robust backup recovery strategy, ensuring that all copies are traceable and managed
  according to organizational policies.
