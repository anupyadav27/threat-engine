title: Ensure Backup is Enabled for IBM Cloud File Storage Resources
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling backups for file storage resources is critical to safeguard against
  data loss due to accidental deletion, corruption, or cyberattacks. Implementing
  a robust backup strategy ensures business continuity and data availability, minimizing
  downtime and facilitating recovery in the event of a disaster.
description: This rule checks whether backup is enabled for IBM Cloud File Storage
  resources, ensuring that critical data is consistently protected and recoverable.
  By enabling backups, organizations can maintain data integrity and quickly restore
  operations, aligning with compliance standards that mandate data protection measures.
  This practice not only enhances data security but also aligns with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which emphasize data availability and protection.
