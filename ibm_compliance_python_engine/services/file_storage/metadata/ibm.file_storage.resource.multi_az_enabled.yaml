title: Ensure Multi-AZ Configuration for IBM Cloud File Storage
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) configuration for IBM Cloud File
  Storage enhances data resiliency and availability. It minimizes the risk of data
  loss or downtime due to a single AZ failure, thus ensuring business continuity and
  maintaining customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that IBM Cloud File Storage resources are
  configured with Multi-AZ support. By distributing storage across multiple availability
  zones, the risk of data loss due to a single point of failure is mitigated, enhancing
  the overall security posture. This setup not only boosts data availability but also
  aligns with compliance standards that require redundancy and disaster recovery measures.
  Implementing Multi-AZ configurations ensures that your storage solutions are robust
  and prepared for both expected and unexpected disruptions.
