rule_id: ibm.file_storage.share.private_network_only
title: Enforce Private Network Access for IBM Cloud File Storage Shares
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring file storage shares are accessible only via private networks is
  crucial for safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  This approach minimizes exposure to external threats by restricting network access
  to trusted environments, aligning with best practices for data protection and regulatory
  compliance.
description: This security rule mandates that IBM Cloud File Storage shares are configured
  to be accessible solely through private networks. By verifying that network access
  control settings are restricted to non-public interfaces, organizations can significantly
  reduce the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access. Implementing this control
  not only enhances the security posture by ensuring data is kept within secure boundaries
  but also aids in meeting compliance requirements related to data privacy and protection
  standards.
