rule_id: ibm.file_storage.share.snapshots_enabled
title: Ensure Snapshots Are Enabled for IBM Cloud File Storage Shares
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling snapshots for IBM Cloud File Storage shares is vital for data
  protection and business continuity. Snapshots provide a point-in-time copy of data,
  allowing for rapid recovery in the event of data corruption, accidental deletion,
  or ransomware attacks. By maintaining regular snapshots, organizations can minimize
  downtime and data loss, thereby safeguarding operational integrity and customer
  trust.
description: This rule checks that snapshots are enabled for IBM Cloud File Storage
  shares, ensuring that regular, automated backups are available. Snapshots act as
  a critical line of defense by allowing administrators to restore data to a previous
  state quickly, thereby mitigating risks associated with data loss or corruption.
  Enabling snapshots also aligns with best practices for compliance with data protection
  regulations, as it supports robust data recovery capabilities and data integrity.
  This proactive measure enhances the resilience of storage solutions within the IBM
  Cloud environment.
