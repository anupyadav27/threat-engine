title: Enforce Least Privilege for KMS Key Policy in IBM File Storage
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing a least privilege access model for KMS key policies is crucial
  to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. By ensuring only
  the necessary permissions are granted, organizations can protect their file storage
  data from potential breaches and misuse, thus maintaining trust and compliance with
  stringent data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the KMS key policies associated with IBM Cloud
  File Storage are configured following the principle of least privilege. It ensures
  that only authorized users and services have the minimum necessary permissions to
  perform their functions. By restricting access to KMS keys, this rule helps prevent
  unauthorized encryption or decryption operations, reducing the risk of data exposure
  and aligning with compliance frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA. This proactive measure
  enhances the overall security posture of the organization's cloud environment.
