title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for IBM Cloud File Storage
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encryption at rest is critical for protecting sensitive data stored in
  IBM Cloud File Storage from unauthorized access and data breaches. Enabling this
  feature ensures that data is automatically encrypted before being written to disk
  and decrypted when accessed, providing an additional layer of security. This practice
  not only protects against physical theft of storage devices but also meets compliance
  requirements for data protection and privacy regulations.
description: This rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for IBM Cloud File
  Storage resources. By ensuring that all stored data is encrypted, organizations
  can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized data access and maintain the confidentiality
  and integrity of their information. Enabling encryption at rest is a key component
  of a robust security posture, as it aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. This proactive measure enhances the overall
  security of stored data and assists organizations in achieving compliance with data
  protection mandates.
