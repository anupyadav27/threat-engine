title: Ensure Incident Automation Artifacts are Encrypted and Private
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting and ensuring the privacy of incident automation artifacts is
  crucial to safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  By maintaining strict encryption standards, organizations can protect sensitive
  information, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and minimizing
  the risk of data exposure, which could lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule evaluates whether incident automation artifacts within the
  IBM Cloud Security Advisor are encrypted and set to private. It checks the encryption
  status of stored data to ensure it meets robust security standards, thereby preventing
  unauthorized access and data breaches. By enforcing encryption at rest, this rule
  strengthens data protection measures and aligns with compliance frameworks such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, offering organizations peace of mind that their data remains
  secure and confidential.
