title: Ensure Network Firewall Logging Is Enabled for Enhanced Security Monitoring
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling network firewall logging is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into network activities, which helps in detecting and mitigating potential security
  threats. Without logging, unauthorized access attempts or policy violations may
  go unnoticed, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for network firewalls within
  your IBM Cloud environment. Enabling logging ensures that all inbound and outbound
  traffic is recorded, allowing for detailed analysis and monitoring of network events.
  This practice not only aids in identifying suspicious activities but also supports
  compliance with various industry standards and regulations by providing a comprehensive
  audit trail of network access and changes.
