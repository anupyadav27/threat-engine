title: Ensure Threat Finding Suppression Rules Are Documented and Scoped
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Proper documentation and scoping of threat finding suppression rules are
  crucial for maintaining an effective security posture. Without clear documentation,
  organizations risk overlooking critical security alerts, leading to potential security
  breaches. Well-scoped suppression rules help minimize false positives, allowing
  security teams to focus on genuine threats, thus enhancing overall security efficiency
  and compliance.
description: This rule checks whether suppression rules for threat findings within
  the IBM Cloud Security Advisor are adequately documented and scoped. It ensures
  that each suppression rule has accompanying documentation that justifies its necessity
  and defines its scope, such as specific threat categories or environments. By doing
  so, it helps organizations maintain a clear understanding of why certain threats
  are suppressed and ensures that the suppression is limited to relevant scenarios.
  This practice not only streamlines threat management but also aids in compliance
  with regulatory standards by providing an auditable trail of risk management decisions.
