title: Ensure Network Anomaly Destinations are Encrypted in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting network anomaly destinations is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access during transmission. It ensures compliance with data
  protection regulations and minimizes the risk of data breaches, which could lead
  to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the organization.
description: This rule verifies that all network anomaly destinations within the IBM
  Cloud Security Advisor service are encrypted, ensuring that data is protected when
  transmitted over networks. By enforcing encryption, this rule helps safeguard sensitive
  data against interception and unauthorized access, thereby enhancing the overall
  security posture of the cloud environment. Compliance with encryption best practices
  can also facilitate adherence to regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  providing both security and legal assurance.
