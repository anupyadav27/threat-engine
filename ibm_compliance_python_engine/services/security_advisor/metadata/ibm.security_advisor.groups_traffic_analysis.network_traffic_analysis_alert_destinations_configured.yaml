title: Configuring Alert Destinations for Network Traffic Analysis
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that alert destinations for network traffic analysis are properly
  configured is crucial for maintaining robust network security. It enables timely
  detection and response to potential threats, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized access. This proactive measure helps in maintaining business continuity
  and protecting sensitive information from potential cyber threats.
description: This rule evaluates whether proper alert destinations are configured
  for network traffic analysis within IBM Cloud's Security Advisor. By ensuring alerts
  are set up, organizations can receive real-time notifications about suspicious or
  anomalous activities in their network traffic. This capability enhances the security
  posture by allowing swift incident response and supports compliance with industry
  regulations that mandate network monitoring and threat detection.
