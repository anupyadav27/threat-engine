rule_id: ibm.security_advisor.advisor_scan.vuln_scan_scope_includes_all_asset_groups
title: Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning Across All Asset Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that vulnerability scans encompass all asset groups is crucial
  for identifying and mitigating security risks across the entire cloud environment.
  This comprehensive approach minimizes the potential for overlooked vulnerabilities,
  thereby reducing the risk of security breaches that could lead to data loss, financial
  impact, and damage to the organization's reputation.
description: This rule verifies that the scope of vulnerability scans within the IBM
  Cloud Security Advisor includes all asset groups to ensure thorough security monitoring.
  By covering all asset groups, the scans can detect vulnerabilities across the entire
  infrastructure, which enhances the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
  This practice not only aligns with best security practices but also supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations by ensuring all assets are continuously
  monitored for vulnerabilities.
