description: This security rule checks if the Defender for Server is enabled on compute
  instances within the IBM Cloud environment. Activating Defender for Server enhances
  security by providing advanced threat detection and automated response capabilities.
  It monitors server activity to identify suspicious behavior and mitigates potential
  threats before they can compromise the system. Compliance with this rule ensures
  adherence to security best practices and helps meet regulatory requirements, reducing
  the risk of non-compliance penalties.
