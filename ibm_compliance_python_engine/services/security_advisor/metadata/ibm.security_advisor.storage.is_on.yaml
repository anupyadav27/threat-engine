title: Ensure Storage Encryption is Enabled for IBM Cloud Resources
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling encryption for storage resources is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This practice not only safeguards
  the confidentiality and integrity of the data but also helps in meeting various
  regulatory compliance requirements, thus minimizing legal and financial repercussions
  for the business.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for storage resources managed
  by IBM Cloud Security Advisor. By ensuring that data at rest is encrypted, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of data exposure. Encryption
  serves as a fundamental security control that enhances the overall security posture
  by aligning with best practices and regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and
  PCI DSS. Implementing this rule helps maintain data privacy and strengthens compliance
  with industry regulations.
