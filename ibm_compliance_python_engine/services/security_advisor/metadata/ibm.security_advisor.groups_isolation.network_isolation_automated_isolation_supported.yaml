title: Automated Network Isolation for Enhanced Security in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Automated network isolation is crucial for minimizing potential security
  risks by ensuring that any detected threats within the cloud environment are promptly
  contained. This proactive approach reduces the attack surface, prevents lateral
  movement by malicious actors, and supports compliance with security standards, thereby
  safeguarding critical business operations and sensitive data.
description: This rule evaluates whether the IBM Cloud environment supports automated
  network isolation for security groups. It checks if the security advisor service
  is configured to automatically isolate compromised or suspicious resources within
  defined security groups, leveraging network segmentation. By implementing automated
  isolation, organizations can quickly respond to security incidents, thereby reducing
  the window of exposure and enhancing their overall security posture. This capability
  not only aligns with best practices for network access control but also aids in
  achieving compliance with industry regulations and frameworks that mandate robust
  security measures.
