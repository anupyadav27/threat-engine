title: Enable Auto-Provisioning of Log Analytics Agents for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling auto-provisioning of log analytics agents ensures that critical
  security logs are consistently collected and monitored across virtual machines.
  This proactive measure helps in early detection of anomalies and potential security
  breaches, thereby mitigating risks and maintaining compliance with auditing standards.
  Without it, organizations may face blind spots in their logging, leading to undetected
  security incidents and compliance violations.
description: This rule checks whether the auto-provisioning of log analytics agents
  on virtual machines is enabled within IBM Cloud's Security Advisor. By ensuring
  these agents are automatically deployed, organizations can maintain continuous log
  monitoring and analysis, which is crucial for identifying unauthorized access attempts,
  system misconfigurations, and other security threats. This automated process not
  only strengthens the organization's security posture but also assists in meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements by ensuring comprehensive audit trails are available
  for review.
