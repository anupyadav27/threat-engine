title: Restrict Network Firewall Allow Any Rule in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Allowing network firewall rules with "permit any" configurations exposes
  cloud resources to unauthorized access and potential breaches. This rule is vital
  for minimizing attack surface and preventing exploitation by malicious actors, ensuring
  data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule assesses firewall configurations within IBM Cloud to identify
  and flag any rules that permit unrestricted access, commonly known as "allow any"
  rules. By enforcing more restrictive access controls, it enhances the security posture
  by ensuring only legitimate traffic is allowed, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access. Implementing such controls also aids in meeting compliance standards, such
  as ISO/IEC 27001 and GDPR, by ensuring robust network security measures are in place.
