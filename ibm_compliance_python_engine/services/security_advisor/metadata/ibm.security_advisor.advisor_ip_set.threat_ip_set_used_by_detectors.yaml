title: Utilization of Threat IP Sets by Security Detectors
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that threat IP sets are actively utilized by security detectors
  is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. This practice helps in the
  early detection of malicious activities, minimizing potential breaches, and protecting
  sensitive data. Proper usage of threat IP sets enhances the ability to respond swiftly
  to threats, reducing business risks and operational disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that the threat IP sets configured within the IBM
  Cloud Security Advisor are employed by active security detectors. By leveraging
  these IP sets, the system can efficiently identify and react to known threat actors,
  thus enhancing the organization's security monitoring capabilities. Ensuring that
  threat IP sets are used by detectors aligns with compliance requirements by demonstrating
  proactive threat management and governance practices. This setup not only augments
  the security framework but also supports adherence to industry standards and regulatory
  mandates.
