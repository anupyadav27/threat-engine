title: Ensure IDS/IPS is Enabled for Network Traffic Analysis in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) for network
  traffic analysis is critical for identifying and mitigating malicious activities
  in real time. This practice helps protect sensitive data and system integrity by
  detecting unauthorized access attempts and preventing potential breaches. Ensuring
  IDS/IPS is active where supported enhances the overall security posture and reduces
  the risk of data loss and operational disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that IDS/IPS is enabled for network traffic analysis
  within IBM Cloud environments where this functionality is supported. By actively
  monitoring network traffic, IDS/IPS can detect and respond to threats, such as suspicious
  patterns or known attack signatures, thereby providing a proactive security measure.
  Implementing this rule aligns with industry best practices and compliance standards,
  ensuring that the network infrastructure is resilient against evolving cyber threats
  and helping meet regulatory requirements for network security.
