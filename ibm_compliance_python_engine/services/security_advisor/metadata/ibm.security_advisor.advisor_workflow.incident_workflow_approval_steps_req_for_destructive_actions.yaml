title: Mandatory Approval Steps for Destructive Actions in Incident Workflows
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that destructive actions within incident workflows require approval

  Without proper oversight, these actions can lead to data loss, security breaches,
  or compliance violations, which could severely impact business operations and stakeholder
  trust.
description: This rule mandates that any workflows involving destructive actions within
  the IBM Cloud Security Advisor service incorporate approval steps. By enforcing
  this requirement, organizations can enhance their incident management processes,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized or accidental changes that could compromise system
  integrity. Compliance with this rule aids in meeting governance standards and ensures
  that critical decisions are verified by authorized personnel, thereby strengthening
  overall security posture.
