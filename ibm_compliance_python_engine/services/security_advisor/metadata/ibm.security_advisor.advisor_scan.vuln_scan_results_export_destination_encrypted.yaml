title: Ensure Vuln Scan Results Export Destination is Encrypted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the export destination of vulnerability scan results is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive
  information about system vulnerabilities could be exposed, leading to potential
  exploitation by malicious actors. This practice not only safeguards the integrity
  and confidentiality of the data but also aligns with compliance requirements for
  data protection and privacy, reducing the risk of financial and reputational damage
  to the organization.
description: This rule verifies that the export destination for vulnerability scan
  results in the IBM Cloud Security Advisor is encrypted. By ensuring encryption at
  rest, this rule protects sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  Implementing encryption enhances the security posture by safeguarding data during
  storage, meeting industry standards and regulatory compliance requirements such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of sensitive information at all
  times. Compliance with this rule helps maintain client trust and secures the organization's
  data assets.
