title: Enforce Least Privilege for Vulnerability Assessment Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for vulnerability assessment roles
  is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential exposure of
  sensitive data. By ensuring that roles have only the permissions necessary to perform
  their specific functions, organizations can reduce the attack surface and prevent
  privilege escalation, thereby protecting critical assets and maintaining regulatory
  compliance.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions assigned to roles within the vulnerability
  assessment service to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege. It checks
  for excessive or unnecessary permissions that may lead to unauthorized access or
  potential data leaks. By enforcing least privilege, this rule enhances security
  by limiting access to sensitive information and functions only to those who require
  it for their job responsibilities. Compliance with this rule supports adherence
  to industry standards and regulations that mandate stringent access control measures,
  thereby improving the overall security posture of the organization.
