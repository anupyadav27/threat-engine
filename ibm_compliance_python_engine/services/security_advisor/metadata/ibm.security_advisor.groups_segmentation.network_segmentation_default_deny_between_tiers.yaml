title: Enforce Default Deny Policy Between Network Tiers
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing a default deny policy between network tiers is crucial for
  minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access. This rule enhances
  the security posture by ensuring that only explicitly permitted traffic can traverse
  different segments, thereby reducing the risk of lateral movement by attackers.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with industry standards that mandate stringent
  network access controls.
description: This rule assesses network segmentation policies to ensure a default
  deny rule is enforced between different network tiers within IBM Cloud environments.
  By checking for the presence of policies that restrict traffic between segments
  unless explicitly allowed, it strengthens security by preventing unintended data
  exposure and access. Adhering to this rule not only improves security but also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001, which emphasize
  robust network access controls.
