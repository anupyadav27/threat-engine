title: Ensuring Deployment of Vulnerability Scanners in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Deploying vulnerability scan agents or scanners is crucial for identifying
  and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities within cloud environments. Regular
  vulnerability scanning helps in proactively managing risks, thereby reducing the
  attack surface and ensuring the integrity of cloud services. This practice not only
  safeguards sensitive data but also supports compliance with industry standards and
  regulations, protecting the organization from legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that vulnerability scan agents or scanners are deployed
  across the IBM Cloud environment, ensuring continuous monitoring for potential security
  threats. By checking for the presence of these tools, the rule enhances the security
  posture by enabling the early detection of vulnerabilities, which can be addressed
  before they are exploited by malicious actors. The deployment of such scanners is
  a fundamental compliance requirement, aligning with best practices for security
  monitoring and governance. It helps organizations maintain a robust security framework,
  thereby supporting adherence to regulatory standards and improving overall security
  resilience.
