title: Ensure Privacy Breach Detection Integrations Are Authenticated
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: This rule is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive data within IBM Cloud environments. Authenticated integrations ensure
  that only authorized entities can access and interact with breach detection tools,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure and ensuring compliance with data
  protection regulations. This mitigates potential business impacts such as data breaches,
  financial penalties, and reputational damage.
description: The rule verifies that all integrations with IBM Security Advisor's Privacy
  Breach Detection services are authenticated. By enforcing authentication, this rule
  ensures that only verified users and systems can access breach detection functionalities.
  This enhances the security posture by protecting against unauthorized access and
  potential data leaks. Moreover, it aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements for data protection and privacy, thereby helping organizations achieve
  compliance with frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA.
