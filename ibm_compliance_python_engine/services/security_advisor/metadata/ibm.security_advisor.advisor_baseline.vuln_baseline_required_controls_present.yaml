title: Ensure Vulnerability Baseline Controls are Implemented in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing vulnerability baseline controls is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture in IBM Cloud environments. These controls help identify
  and mitigate potential security risks, ensuring that the infrastructure is protected
  against known vulnerabilities. By adhering to these baseline controls, organizations
  can minimize the risk of data breaches and maintain customer trust while meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements.
description: The rule checks for the presence of required vulnerability baseline controls
  within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor service. These controls are essential for
  detecting and managing vulnerabilities across cloud resources, thereby enhancing
  the security of the cloud environment. By ensuring that these controls are in place,
  organizations can proactively monitor their infrastructure for security threats,
  take corrective actions, and demonstrate compliance with industry standards and
  regulations. This process not only strengthens the overall security framework but
  also supports continuous security monitoring and governance.
