title: Enable Audit Logging for Vulnerability Automation Changes
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for vulnerability automation changes is crucial
  for maintaining a comprehensive security posture in IBM Cloud environments. It allows
  organizations to track and review changes made to vulnerability automation settings,
  ensuring that any unauthorized or inadvertent modifications are detected promptly.
  This proactive approach minimizes security risks and helps in maintaining compliance
  with industry regulations by providing a detailed audit trail.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for changes in the
  vulnerability automation settings within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor. By monitoring
  and logging these changes, organizations can ensure that all modifications are authorized
  and documented. This practice not only enhances security by detecting potential
  misconfigurations or unauthorized access but also supports compliance with standards
  like ISO 27001 and NIST, which require detailed audit trails for security-related
  activities. Implementing this logging mechanism provides transparency and accountability,
  facilitating swift incident response and forensic analysis when necessary.
