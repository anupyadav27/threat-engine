title: Ensure Additional Email for Security Contact is Configured in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring an additional email for security contacts in IBM Cloud provides
  an extra layer of communication redundancy, ensuring critical security alerts and
  notifications are reliably received. This is crucial for maintaining a responsive
  security posture, minimizing the risk of missed communications that could lead to
  delayed incident response and potential data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that an additional email address is configured alongside
  the primary security contact within IBM Security Advisor. By implementing this configuration,
  organizations enhance their monitoring capabilities, ensuring critical alerts reach
  multiple recipients, thereby reducing the risk of oversight. This setup is particularly
  beneficial for compliance with governance frameworks that mandate reliable communication
  channels for security incident management, supporting continuous monitoring and
  timely responses to security threats.
