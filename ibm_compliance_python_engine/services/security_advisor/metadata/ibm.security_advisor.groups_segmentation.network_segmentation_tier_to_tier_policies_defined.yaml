title: Define Network Segmentation Tier-to-Tier Policies for Secure Access
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing tier-to-tier network segmentation policies is crucial for
  minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within cloud environments.
  By defining these policies, organizations can better protect sensitive data, maintain
  system integrity, and comply with regulatory requirements, thereby reducing potential
  business disruptions due to security breaches.
description: This rule ensures that network segmentation policies are defined between
  different tiers within the IBM Cloud environment. It checks for the presence of
  policies that restrict and control data flow between network tiers, enhancing overall
  security by enforcing least privilege access. Implementing these policies aids in
  mitigating the risk of attacks that exploit open network paths, while also aligning
  with compliance frameworks that require stringent access controls and data protection
  measures.
