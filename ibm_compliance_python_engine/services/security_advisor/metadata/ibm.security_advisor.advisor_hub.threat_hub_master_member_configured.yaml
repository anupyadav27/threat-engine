title: Ensure Threat Hub Master Member is Properly Configured in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring the Threat Hub Master Member is essential for centralized threat
  intelligence and security event management. It enables organizations to efficiently
  manage and respond to security incidents by aggregating threat data across multiple
  sources. This reduces the risk of undetected security incidents that could have
  significant business impacts, including data breaches and compliance violations.
description: This rule checks that the Threat Hub Master Member is correctly configured
  within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor service. A properly configured Threat Hub
  Master Member ensures that security alerts and threat intelligence data are centralized,
  allowing for improved visibility and faster incident response times. This configuration
  aids in maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations by ensuring
  that security monitoring and response capabilities are robust and effectively managed.
  By centralizing threat intelligence, organizations can better detect and mitigate
  potential threats, ultimately strengthening the overall security posture.
