rule_id: ibm.security_advisor.resource.container_images_scan_enabled
title: Ensure Container Images Scanning is Enabled on IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling container image scanning is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities
  early in the development lifecycle. Unscanned images can harbor security flaws that
  may be exploited by adversaries, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data
  breaches. By enforcing image scans, businesses can enhance their security posture,
  reduce risks, and maintain compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that container image scanning is enabled within the
  IBM Cloud environment, a pivotal step in maintaining a secure containerized application
  ecosystem. Container image scanning detects known vulnerabilities within images
  by comparing them against continuously updated vulnerability databases. This proactive
  measure ensures that only secure and compliant images are deployed, aligning with
  best practices for container and Kubernetes security. Enabling image scanning contributes
  to a comprehensive security monitoring strategy, helping organizations achieve regulatory
  compliance and safeguard their infrastructure against potential threats.
