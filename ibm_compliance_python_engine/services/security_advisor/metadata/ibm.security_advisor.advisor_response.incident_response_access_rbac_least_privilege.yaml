title: Enforce Least Privilege in Incident Response Role-Based Access Control
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in incident response access
  ensures that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their roles, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By strictly controlling
  access, organizations can minimize the attack surface and protect sensitive information,
  thereby maintaining customer trust and compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies for
  incident response within IBM Cloud Security Advisor are configured to enforce least
  privilege. It assesses whether users and service accounts have only the permissions
  strictly necessary to carry out their incident response duties. By ensuring that
  access is limited to the minimum required, this rule helps prevent unauthorized
  access to critical incident management functions, thereby strengthening the security
  posture of the organization. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry
  standards and regulatory frameworks that mandate controlled access to sensitive
  data and incident management resources.
