title: Ensure Edge WAF Block Actions Are Configured Beyond Count Mode
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring Edge Web Application Firewall (WAF) to actively block threats,
  rather than merely counting them, is crucial for maintaining robust security posture.
  By enforcing block actions, organizations can prevent potential attacks in real-time,
  thus protecting sensitive data and ensuring business continuity. A proactive block
  approach minimizes the attack surface, reduces the risk of data breaches, and aligns
  with best practices for compliance and governance.
description: This rule verifies that the Edge WAF is configured to use block actions
  for threat mitigation rather than only counting potential threats. In a counting-only
  mode, the WAF logs threats without taking action, which can leave systems vulnerable
  to exploits. Implementing block actions ensures that malicious traffic is immediately
  mitigated, enhancing the security of web applications. This practice not only fortifies
  the organization's defense mechanisms but also supports compliance with data protection
  regulations by actively safeguarding customer data.
