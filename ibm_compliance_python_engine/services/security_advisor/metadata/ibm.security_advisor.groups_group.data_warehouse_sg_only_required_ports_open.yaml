rule_id: ibm.security_advisor.groups_group.data_warehouse_sg_only_required_ports_open
title: Ensure Data Warehouse Security Groups Have Only Necessary Ports Open
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that only required ports are open on data warehouse security groups
  is crucial to minimize the attack surface. Open ports can provide entry points for
  unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with
  data protection regulations. By restricting port access, organizations can better
  protect sensitive data and maintain customer trust.
description: This rule checks that security groups associated with data warehouses
  on the IBM Cloud have only the necessary ports open, thereby reducing the risk of
  unauthorized access. It evaluates the configuration of security groups to ensure
  compliance with best practices for data protection and privacy, specifically focusing
  on encryption at rest. Adhering to this rule helps organizations align with regulatory
  requirements and enhances overall cloud security posture by mitigating potential
  vulnerabilities.
