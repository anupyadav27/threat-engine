title: Ensure Email Notifications to Resource Owners are Enabled
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling email notifications to resource owners is crucial for maintaining
  awareness of security events and potential vulnerabilities within the IBM Cloud
  environment. This proactive measure ensures that resource owners are promptly informed
  about security advisories, helping to mitigate risks and maintain the integrity
  and compliance of cloud resources.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM Cloud Security Advisor is configured
  to send email notifications to resource owners. By ensuring that this setting is
  enabled, organizations can enhance their security posture by providing timely alerts
  about security incidents, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues. This facilitates
  prompt response and remediation, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and
  ensuring adherence to compliance standards. Enabling notifications supports continuous
  security monitoring and governance, aligning with best practices for cloud security
  management.
