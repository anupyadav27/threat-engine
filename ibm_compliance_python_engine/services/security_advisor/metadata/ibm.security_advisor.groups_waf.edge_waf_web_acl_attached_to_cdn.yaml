title: Ensure Edge WAF Web ACL is Attached to IBM Cloud CDN
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Web Access Control Lists
  (ACLs) on the IBM Cloud CDN is critical for protecting web applications from a variety
  of attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. This security measure
  not only helps in safeguarding sensitive data but also ensures business continuity
  by mitigating potential disruptions caused by malicious traffic.
description: This rule verifies that an Edge WAF Web ACL is properly attached to the
  IBM Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN). Attaching a WAF Web ACL to a CDN enhances
  security by filtering and monitoring HTTP requests, providing an additional layer
  of defense against application-layer threats. Compliance with this rule helps organizations
  maintain a robust security posture, aligning with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements by preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.
