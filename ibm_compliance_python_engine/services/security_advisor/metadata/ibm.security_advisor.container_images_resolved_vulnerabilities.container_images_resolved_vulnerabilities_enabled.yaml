title: Ensure Resolved Vulnerabilities Monitoring for Container Images
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Monitoring resolved vulnerabilities in container images is crucial for
  maintaining a secure containerized environment. It helps organizations quickly identify
  and address vulnerabilities that have been patched, ensuring that container images
  are updated and secure. This proactive approach reduces the attack surface and minimizes
  the risk of exploitation, thereby protecting business-critical applications and
  data.
description: This rule checks whether the monitoring of resolved vulnerabilities in
  container images is enabled within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor. By enabling this
  feature, organizations can ensure that they are alerted to vulnerabilities that
  have been identified and fixed in newer versions of container images. This continuous
  monitoring supports security best practices by promoting the use of up-to-date,
  secure images, and aids in compliance with industry standards like CIS Benchmarks
  and NIST guidelines. It also facilitates automated security posture management,
  allowing teams to focus on remediating vulnerabilities effectively.
