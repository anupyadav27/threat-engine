title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Incident Workflow in IBM Security Advisor
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for incident workflows is critical to safeguarding
  sensitive data within IBM Security Advisor. This measure prevents unauthorized access
  and ensures data integrity by encrypting data at rest using a managed key service.
  Maintaining encryption compliance not only protects against data breaches but also
  supports regulatory adherence, thereby minimizing potential legal and financial
  repercussions.
description: This security rule verifies that the IBM Security Advisor's incident
  workflow utilizes Key Management Service (KMS) encryption to secure data at rest.
  By enabling KMS encryption, data associated with security incidents is encrypted
  using keys that are managed by IBM's robust KMS infrastructure, enhancing data confidentiality
  and integrity. Implementing this encryption standard aligns with industry best practices
  and compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring data protection and
  privacy. Regular compliance checks via this rule help organizations maintain a strong
  security posture by mitigating risks associated with unencrypted sensitive data.
