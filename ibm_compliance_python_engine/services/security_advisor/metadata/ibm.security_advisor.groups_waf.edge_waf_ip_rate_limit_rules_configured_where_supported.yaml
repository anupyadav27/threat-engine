title: Ensure IP Rate Limiting is Configured for Edge WAF Where Supported
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring IP rate limiting for Edge Web Application Firewalls (WAF) is
  crucial to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and reduce the risk of
  resource exhaustion. By limiting the number of requests from a single IP, organizations
  can prevent malicious actors from overwhelming their applications, ensuring continuous
  availability and performance for legitimate users.
description: This rule checks if IP rate limiting is configured in Edge WAF settings
  for supported IBM Cloud environments. Implementing IP rate limiting helps in mitigating
  the impact of volumetric attacks by controlling the traffic flow and preventing
  abuse from any single source. It enhances the security posture by providing an additional
  layer of defense, ensuring compliance with security best practices and industry
  regulations that require robust traffic management and application availability.
