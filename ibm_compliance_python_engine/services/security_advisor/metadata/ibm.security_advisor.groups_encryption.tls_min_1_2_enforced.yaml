title: Enforce TLS 1.2 for Secure Data Encryption in IBM Cloud Security Advisor
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing a minimum of TLS 1.2 ensures that data in transit is protected
  with robust encryption, mitigating the risk of interception and tampering by malicious
  actors. This requirement is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of sensitive data, reducing potential data breaches, and aligning with industry
  best practices and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks that the IBM Cloud Security Advisor service enforces
  a minimum of TLS 1.2 for encrypting data in transit within the groups_encryption
  resource. By mandating TLS 1.2, the system leverages modern cryptographic algorithms
  that provide enhanced security over older protocols, protecting against known vulnerabilities.
  This enforcement helps organizations adhere to compliance standards such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which require strong encryption methods to safeguard sensitive
  data and maintain customer trust.
