title: Ensure Incident Response Data Versioning and Immutability in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling versioning and immutability for incident response data in IBM
  Cloud is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of critical security
  information. It ensures that incident records are preserved in their original state,
  preventing unauthorized alterations that could compromise forensic investigations
  and compliance with regulatory requirements. This practice supports the organization's
  ability to provide accurate reports during audits and can significantly aid in legal
  proceedings if necessary.
description: This rule verifies that versioning and immutability are enabled for incident
  response data stored within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor service. By enforcing
  versioning, the system keeps an archive of changes, allowing for historical audits
  and recovery of previous states if needed. Immutability further solidifies data
  integrity by safeguarding records from being modified or deleted, ensuring that
  the integrity of the incident response information is maintained. This compliance
  measure enhances data protection, aids in regulatory adherence such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, and supports best practices for incident management and forensic readiness.
