title: Ensure Privacy Breach Detection Alerts Are Properly Configured
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Configuring alert destinations for privacy breach detection is critical
  for ensuring that potential data breaches are identified and communicated to appropriate
  stakeholders promptly. This proactive measure allows organizations to respond quickly
  to data privacy incidents, minimizing the risk of data loss and reducing potential
  legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that alert destinations are configured for privacy
  breach detection within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor service. By setting up these
  alerts, organizations can ensure that any detected privacy breaches are immediately
  reported to designated personnel or systems, facilitating a timely response. It
  enhances overall security by enabling rapid incident management and aligns with
  data protection regulations that require timely breach notifications. Proper configuration
  of alert destinations supports compliance with industry standards like GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate the protection and confidentiality of sensitive information.
