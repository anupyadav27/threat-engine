title: Enforce Least Privilege for Vuln Automation Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle for Vulnerability Automation
  Execution Roles is crucial to minimizing security risks. By ensuring that roles
  have only the permissions necessary to perform their functions, organizations can
  significantly reduce the attack surface. This practice helps prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive information and
  maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that all Vulnerability Automation Execution Roles
  within IBM Cloud's Security Advisor service adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It checks whether these roles are assigned only the permissions necessary for their
  specific tasks, thereby preventing excessive access rights. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can enhance their security posture by reducing the risk of privilege
  escalation attacks. Moreover, ensuring compliance with least privilege principles
  can help in meeting various regulatory requirements, thereby demonstrating a commitment
  to robust security practices.
