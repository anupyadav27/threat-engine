title: Restrict Network ACL Egress for Enhanced Security Control
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting egress traffic in network ACLs is crucial for minimizing the
  risk of unauthorized data exfiltration and potential exposure to external threats.
  By enforcing stringent egress rules, organizations can ensure that only necessary
  and approved traffic exits their cloud environment, thereby reducing the attack
  surface and enhancing overall network security.
description: This rule checks for restrictions on egress traffic in Network ACLs within
  IBM Cloud to ensure that only specific, authorized traffic is permitted to leave
  the cloud environment. By implementing egress restrictions, organizations can maintain
  a secure perimeter, prevent data leakage, and comply with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. This proactive security measure helps in mitigating risks
  associated with unrestricted outbound connections, thereby contributing to a robust
  security posture and facilitating adherence to industry standards.
