title: Enforce Least Privilege for Vulnerability Maintenance Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for roles involved in vulnerability maintenance
  is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of sensitive
  operations. Limiting permissions to only what is necessary for performing specific
  tasks protects critical systems and data from accidental or malicious actions. This
  approach not only enhances security but also ensures compliance with regulatory
  standards, reducing the potential for costly data breaches and reputational damage.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions assigned to roles within the vulnerability
  maintenance process on IBM Cloud. It ensures that only the minimum necessary permissions
  are granted to users and service accounts, aligning with the principle of least
  privilege. By restricting access based on job function, organizations can reduce
  the attack surface and prevent privilege escalation, thereby improving overall security
  posture. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry regulations and
  standards, such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, which advocate for stringent access
  control measures.
