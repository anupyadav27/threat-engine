rule_id: ibm.security_advisor.groups_group.network_sg_only_required_ports_open
title: Ensure Only Necessary Ports Are Open in IBM Cloud Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting open ports in security groups to only those necessary for operation
  minimizes the attack surface, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. This practice is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive data, as exposed ports can be exploited by malicious actors, leading
  to data loss or service disruption.
description: This rule ensures that IBM Cloud Security Groups have only the required
  ports open to meet operational needs. By evaluating the configuration of security
  groups, the rule checks for unnecessary open ports that could be leveraged for unauthorized
  access. Enforcing this rule helps in aligning with industry best practices for network
  security, reducing vulnerabilities, and achieving compliance with security standards
  such as ISO 27001 and NIST. It aids in maintaining a robust security posture by
  minimizing potential entry points for attackers.
