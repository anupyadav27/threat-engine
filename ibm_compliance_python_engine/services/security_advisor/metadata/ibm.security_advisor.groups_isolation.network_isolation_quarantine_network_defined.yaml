title: Ensure Quarantine Network Is Defined for Isolated Network Groups
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Defining a quarantine network for isolated groups is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and lateral movement within the cloud environment. This measure
  ensures that compromised or suspicious resources are isolated, mitigating potential
  threats and protecting sensitive data and operations. Failure to adhere to this
  rule may result in increased vulnerability to network breaches and non-compliance
  with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that a quarantine network is defined for all isolated
  network groups within IBM Cloud. By establishing a designated quarantine network,
  organizations can effectively contain suspicious or compromised resources, preventing
  them from interacting with critical systems. This enhances the overall security
  posture by ensuring that containment and remediation measures are in place, aligning
  with best practices for network security and compliance with regulatory frameworks.
  Implementing this rule aids in maintaining network integrity and supports compliance
  with standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
