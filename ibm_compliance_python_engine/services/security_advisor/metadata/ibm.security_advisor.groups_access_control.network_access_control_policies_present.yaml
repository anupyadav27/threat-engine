title: Ensure Network Access Control Policies Are Implemented
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing network access control policies is crucial for safeguarding
  sensitive resources and data within IBM Cloud. These policies help prevent unauthorized
  access, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with industry
  standards. Without these controls, organizations may face significant security vulnerabilities
  and potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies the presence of network access control policies within
  the IBM Cloud Security Advisor's groups access control settings. By ensuring these
  policies are in place, organizations can enforce strict access controls, manage
  permissions effectively, and maintain robust security postures. This not only enhances
  the overall security framework but also aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, ultimately protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access
  and potential exploitation.
