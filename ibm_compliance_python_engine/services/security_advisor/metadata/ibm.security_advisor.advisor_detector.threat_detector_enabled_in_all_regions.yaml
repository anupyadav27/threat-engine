rule_id: ibm.security_advisor.advisor_detector.threat_detector_enabled_in_all_regions
title: Ensure Threat Detector is Active in All IBM Cloud Regions
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Threat Detector across all regions is critical for maintaining
  a robust security posture. It ensures real-time detection and response to potential
  threats, minimizing risks to your cloud infrastructure. Neglecting to enable this
  feature in any region could lead to undetected vulnerabilities, compromising data
  integrity and leading to potential non-compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks that the Threat Detector within IBM Cloud Security Advisor
  is activated in all regions where your resources are deployed. By having the Threat
  Detector operational across all regions, you enhance your ability to monitor, detect,
  and respond to security incidents globally. This practice not only fortifies your
  security posture but also aids in achieving compliance with regulatory requirements
  by ensuring consistent security monitoring and threat management across all operational
  environments.
