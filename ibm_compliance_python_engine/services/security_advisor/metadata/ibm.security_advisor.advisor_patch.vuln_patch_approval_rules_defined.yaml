title: Ensure Vulnerability Patch Approval Rules are Defined
severity: medium
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Defining vulnerability patch approval rules is crucial for maintaining
  a secure cloud environment. It ensures that critical patches are systematically
  reviewed and approved, minimizing the risk of exploitation by malicious actors.
  By enforcing structured patch management, organizations can reduce potential downtime
  and safeguard business operations from emerging threats.
description: This rule verifies that approval procedures for vulnerability patches
  are established within IBM Cloud's Security Advisor service. By implementing defined
  patch approval rules, organizations can standardize the process of evaluating and
  applying security updates, ensuring that patches are tested and approved before
  deployment. This practice not only enhances the overall security posture but also
  aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements by demonstrating a proactive
  approach to vulnerability management.
