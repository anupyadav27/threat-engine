title: Restrict Ingress Traffic in Security Groups to Enhance Network Security
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Allowing unrestricted ingress traffic on network security groups can expose
  cloud resources to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches and
  cyber-attacks. By ensuring that no ingress rule allows open access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0),
  organizations can tightly control network access, thus mitigating potential security
  threats and maintaining robust compliance with security policies.
description: This rule checks for security groups within the IBM Cloud that have ingress
  rules allowing traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Allowing such unrestricted
  access can lead to potential vulnerabilities by exposing cloud resources to the
  internet. By enforcing this rule, you ensure that only specific, trusted IP addresses
  are permitted, enhancing the security posture of your cloud environment. Furthermore,
  this practice supports compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate
  stringent access controls, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and
  data breaches.
