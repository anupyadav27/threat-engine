title: Ensure Network Automation Change Audit Logging is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for network automation changes is crucial for maintaining
  a secure and compliant cloud environment. It helps detect unauthorized or inadvertent
  changes to network configurations, which could lead to security vulnerabilities
  or service disruptions. By maintaining a detailed log, organizations can swiftly
  investigate incidents and ensure accountability, thus protecting sensitive data
  and supporting compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for network automation
  changes in the IBM Cloud Security Advisor's Groups Automation service. Audit logging
  captures and records details about changes to network configurations, including
  who made the change, what was changed, and when it occurred. This capability strengthens
  security by enabling real-time monitoring and historical analysis of network activities.
  Moreover, it supports compliance with various industry standards by providing a
  verifiable audit trail of security-related events, helping organizations meet regulatory
  requirements and avoid potential fines.
