severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Edge Web Application Firewall (WAF) Managed Rule Sets is crucial
  for protecting web applications from a wide range of threats, including common vulnerabilities
  such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. By leveraging these managed rule
  sets, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and maintain
  the integrity and availability of their web applications, ultimately safeguarding
  business operations and customer trust.
description: This security rule checks whether the Edge WAF Managed Rule Sets are
  enabled in your IBM Cloud environment. These rule sets are continuously updated
  by security experts to address the latest threats, providing an automated layer
  of defense against web-based attacks. Enabling them enhances your security posture
  by proactively mitigating potential vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with
  industry standards and regulations. This proactive approach helps in maintaining
  robust security monitoring and governance across your cloud assets.
