title: Ensure Network Firewall Rule Groups are Properly Attached
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that network firewall rule groups are properly attached is crucial
  for maintaining a robust security posture within the IBM Cloud environment. Misconfigured
  or unattached firewall rules can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
  can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Proper attachment
  and configuration of firewall rules help mitigate these risks and support compliance
  with regulatory standards.
description: This security rule checks whether network firewall rule groups are attached
  to the respective network resources within the IBM Cloud environment. By verifying
  the attachment of these rules, it ensures that only authorized traffic is allowed
  to flow in and out of the network, thereby reducing the attack surface. The proper
  implementation of firewall rules is essential for enforcing network access control
  policies and maintaining compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS and
  ISO 27001. This proactive approach not only safeguards network resources but also
  aids in achieving a secure and compliant cloud infrastructure.
