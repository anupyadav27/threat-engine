title: Essential Endpoint Protection for IBM Cloud Virtual Machines
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring endpoint protection is installed on virtual machines (VMs) within
  IBM Cloud is critical to safeguarding against malware and unauthorized access. By
  implementing robust endpoint security, organizations can mitigate potential breaches,
  protect sensitive data, and maintain business continuity. This measure is a fundamental
  component of a comprehensive network security strategy, helping to maintain trust
  and compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that endpoint protection software is installed and
  active on IBM Cloud virtual machines, enhancing the security posture by preventing,
  detecting, and responding to threats. By ensuring that endpoint protection is implemented,
  organizations can better defend against cyber threats, reduce the risk of data loss,
  and comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular monitoring
  and updates to the endpoint protection software ensure continuous protection against
  evolving threats, supporting a secure and resilient cloud environment.
