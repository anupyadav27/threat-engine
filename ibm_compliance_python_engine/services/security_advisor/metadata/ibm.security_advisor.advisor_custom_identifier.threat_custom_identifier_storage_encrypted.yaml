title: Ensure Encryption of Threat Custom Identifier Storage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting storage for threat custom identifiers is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and data breaches, which can lead to compromised security and
  loss of sensitive information. Implementing encryption at rest safeguards data by
  ensuring that even if storage media is accessed inappropriately, the data remains
  unreadable without the decryption keys, thus maintaining business integrity and
  customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all storage associated with threat custom identifiers
  within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor is encrypted. By ensuring encryption at rest,
  the rule enhances data protection by mitigating the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
  It aligns with industry standards and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate robust encryption practices to protect sensitive information.
  Regular checks against this rule ensure continuous compliance and strengthen the
  overall security posture of the IBM Cloud environment.
