title: Restrict Ingress Traffic to Data Warehouse Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Limiting ingress traffic to data warehouses is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. By ensuring that no inbound traffic is allowed
  from the internet, organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain compliance
  with data protection regulations. This rule helps mitigate risks associated with
  exposed data assets, which can lead to severe financial and reputational damage.
description: This security rule checks for the absence of ingress permissions on security
  groups associated with data warehouses, ensuring that no inbound traffic is allowed.
  By restricting ingress traffic, the rule enforces a security posture that minimizes
  attack vectors, thereby enhancing the overall security of the data infrastructure.
  Implementing this measure aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and
  regulations by safeguarding data at rest against unauthorized access and potential
  threats.
