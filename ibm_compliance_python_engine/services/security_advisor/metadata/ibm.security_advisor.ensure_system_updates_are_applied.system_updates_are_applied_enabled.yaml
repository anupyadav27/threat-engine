title: Ensure System Updates Are Applied for Compliance and Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Keeping system updates applied is crucial for mitigating vulnerabilities
  that can be exploited by malicious actors. Regularly applying system updates reduces
  the risk of security breaches and helps maintain the integrity and availability
  of cloud resources, thereby ensuring business continuity and compliance with regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule checks whether system updates are applied across IBM Cloud
  services to ensure that all components are running the latest patches and security
  updates. By enabling and enforcing system updates, organizations can protect against
  known vulnerabilities and threats. This practice not only enhances the security
  posture of the cloud environment but also aids in meeting compliance requirements
  by adhering to industry best practices and regulatory mandates for security monitoring
  and governance.
