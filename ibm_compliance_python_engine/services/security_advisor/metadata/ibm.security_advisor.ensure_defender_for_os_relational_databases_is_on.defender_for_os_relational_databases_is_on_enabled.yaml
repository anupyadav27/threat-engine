title: Ensure IBM Defender for OS Relational Databases is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling IBM Defender for OS Relational Databases is crucial for maintaining
  robust data protection and privacy measures. It ensures that sensitive data stored
  in relational databases is continuously monitored for vulnerabilities and threats,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This proactive security
  measure helps maintain customer trust and compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether the IBM Defender for OS Relational Databases
  is enabled, ensuring that security monitoring and threat detection capabilities
  are active for relational database environments. By enabling this feature, organizations
  benefit from automated threat management, real-time alerts, and enhanced visibility
  into potential security incidents. This not only safeguards sensitive data but also
  aids in achieving compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that data at rest is properly encrypted and
  monitored.
