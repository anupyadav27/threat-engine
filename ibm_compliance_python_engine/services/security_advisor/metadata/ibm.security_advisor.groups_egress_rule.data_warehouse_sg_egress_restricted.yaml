title: Restrict Egress Traffic for Data Warehouse Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that egress traffic from data warehouse security groups is restricted
  is critical to safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized exfiltration. Unrestricted
  egress rules can lead to data breaches, potentially violating compliance requirements
  and exposing the organization to financial and reputational damage. By controlling
  outbound traffic, organizations can better protect their data assets and maintain
  a robust security posture.
description: This rule checks that security groups associated with data warehouses
  on IBM Cloud have restrictive egress rules configured. By limiting the destinations
  and protocols that egress traffic can use, organizations reduce the risk of data
  leaks and unauthorized data transfers. Adhering to this rule helps organizations
  comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, which require stringent
  controls over data access and movement. Implementing egress restrictions is a key
  component of a defense-in-depth strategy, enhancing overall security by ensuring
  that only authorized communication occurs.
