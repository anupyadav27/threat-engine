title: Ensure Auto-Provisioning of Vulnerability Assessments is Enabled
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling auto-provisioning of vulnerability assessments for machines on
  IBM Cloud significantly enhances security by ensuring that all virtual machines
  are routinely assessed for vulnerabilities. This proactive measure helps in identifying
  potential security threats before they can be exploited, thereby reducing the risk
  of data breaches and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that the auto-provisioning feature for vulnerability
  assessments is enabled on all applicable machines within the IBM Cloud environment.
  By automatically deploying vulnerability assessments, organizations can maintain
  continuous security monitoring and promptly address any discovered vulnerabilities.
  This practice not only strengthens the overall security posture but also aids in
  meeting compliance requirements as outlined by regulatory bodies. Implementing this
  rule ensures that security assessments are not overlooked and are conducted consistently
  across the cloud infrastructure.
