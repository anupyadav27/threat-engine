title: Auto Enrollment of New Accounts into Threat Hub for Enhanced Security Monitoring
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Automatically enrolling new accounts into the Threat Hub is crucial for
  maintaining a proactive security posture. This ensures that any new resources are
  immediately subject to existing monitoring and threat detection protocols, reducing
  the risk of undetected malicious activity. It also streamlines compliance efforts
  by integrating new accounts into established governance frameworks from the outset.
description: This rule checks whether new accounts are automatically enrolled into
  the Threat Hub within IBM Cloud's Security Advisor service. By doing so, it ensures
  that all new resources benefit from continuous security monitoring and threat intelligence
  capabilities. This enhances the overall security posture by providing timely detection
  and response to potential threats. Additionally, automatic enrollment aids in compliance
  with security standards and regulations that require comprehensive monitoring of
  cloud environments, thereby supporting organizational governance and risk management
  strategies.
