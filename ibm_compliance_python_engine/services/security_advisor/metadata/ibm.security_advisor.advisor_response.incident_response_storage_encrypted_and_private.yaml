rule_id: ibm.security_advisor.advisor_response.incident_response_storage_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure Incident Response Storage is Encrypted and Private
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting and securing incident response storage is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that storage is both encrypted and private, organizations mitigate risks associated
  with data leaks and enhance compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  thereby maintaining customer trust and avoiding potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks that the storage used for incident response data in
  the IBM Cloud Security Advisor is encrypted and access is restricted to authorized
  personnel only. Encryption at rest protects data by converting it into a secure
  format that can only be read with the correct decryption key, while privacy settings
  ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can access the data. Compliance
  with this rule not only strengthens the security posture by safeguarding sensitive
  information but also aligns with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  enhancing the organization's overall compliance framework.
