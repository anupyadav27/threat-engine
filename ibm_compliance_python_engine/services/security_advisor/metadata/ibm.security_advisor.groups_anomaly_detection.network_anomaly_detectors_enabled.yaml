title: Ensure Network Anomaly Detectors are Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling network anomaly detectors is crucial for identifying and mitigating
  suspicious activities within your IBM Cloud environment. These detectors help in
  early detection of potential security threats, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and unauthorized access. By proactively monitoring network traffic, organizations
  can maintain trust with clients and comply with regulatory requirements, minimizing
  potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies whether network anomaly detectors are actively enabled
  within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor's anomaly detection groups. Enabling these
  detectors is vital for monitoring deviations from normal network behavior, thereby
  enhancing the security posture by providing alerts on potential threats. Implementing
  this control aids in maintaining compliance with security standards and frameworks
  by ensuring that proactive measures are in place to detect and respond to network
  anomalies effectively.
