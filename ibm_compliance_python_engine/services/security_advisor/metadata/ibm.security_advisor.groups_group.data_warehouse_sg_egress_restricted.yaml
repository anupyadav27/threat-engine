title: Restrict Egress Traffic for Data Warehouse Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing egress restrictions on security groups for data warehouses
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration. By controlling outbound traffic,
  organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure sensitive information
  is only accessible to authorized endpoints, thereby protecting business-critical
  data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that egress traffic from data warehouse security groups
  is restricted to specific, trusted endpoints. By enforcing strict outbound rules,
  it mitigates the risk of accidental data exposure and malicious data exfiltration.
  This practice aligns with best practices for data protection and privacy, ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations by safeguarding data at rest and in
  transit. The enforcement of egress restrictions enhances the overall security posture,
  ensuring that data movements are monitored and controlled in accordance with organizational
  policies.
