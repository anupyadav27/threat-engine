title: Network Segmentation Exception Approvals for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Network segmentation is a critical component of cloud security that limits
  the spread of threats and restricts unauthorized access to sensitive data. Enforcing
  exception approvals ensures that any deviation from established network segmentation
  policies is carefully reviewed and justified, minimizing potential exposure to security
  risks and compliance violations.
description: This rule mandates that any exceptions to network segmentation policies
  within the IBM Cloud environment must be formally approved. By requiring documented
  approvals for these exceptions, organizations can maintain a high level of network
  security and ensure that any deviations are necessary and controlled. This process
  not only enhances security by preventing unauthorized access paths but also aids
  in meeting compliance standards by demonstrating due diligence in network management.
  The implementation of such controls helps in maintaining a secure and resilient
  cloud infrastructure, safeguarding both business operations and customer data.
