title: Ensure Edge WAF Logging is Enabled for Comprehensive Audit Trails
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for Edge Web Application Firewall (WAF) is critical for
  maintaining robust security postures. It allows security teams to monitor and analyze
  web traffic for potential threats and anomalous activities, ensuring timely detection
  and response. Furthermore, logging is essential for compliance with industry regulations
  and standards, aiding in forensic analysis and incident response.
description: This rule checks if logging is activated for Edge WAF instances within
  IBM Cloud Security Advisor. Enabling Edge WAF logging captures detailed records
  of web traffic events, facilitating the detection of suspicious activities and policy
  violations. This capability enhances overall security by providing visibility into
  application-layer events, supporting compliance with regulatory requirements such
  as GDPR and PCI DSS. Furthermore, these logs can be integrated with SIEM solutions
  for advanced threat analysis and incident management.
