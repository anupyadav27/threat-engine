title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Incident Automation Changes
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for incident automation changes is crucial for maintaining
  a secure and compliant cloud environment. It allows organizations to track modifications
  and activities related to security incidents, ensuring transparency and accountability.
  This helps in identifying unauthorized changes and supports forensic investigations,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether audit logging is enabled for changes made in
  the incident automation configurations within IBM Cloud Security Advisor. By ensuring
  audit logs are active, organizations can monitor and record every alteration to
  their automated incident response settings. This not only enhances the security
  posture by providing a trail of all changes but also aligns with compliance requirements
  that mandate thorough documentation of security-related activities. Such logging
  is vital for satisfying regulatory frameworks and demonstrating a proactive approach
  to security management.
