title: Enable Identity-Aware Policies for Network Microsegmentation
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Identity-aware policies in network microsegmentation enhance security by
  ensuring that only authenticated identities can access specific network segments.
  This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and limits the impact of potential
  breaches, thus protecting sensitive data and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule checks whether identity-aware policies are enabled within IBM
  Cloud's network microsegmentation. By enforcing identity verification for network
  access, it strengthens the security posture by ensuring that only verified users
  or systems can interact with designated network segments. This approach aligns with
  best practices for zero trust architecture, reduces the attack surface, and aids
  in compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring that
  access to data is strictly controlled and monitored.
