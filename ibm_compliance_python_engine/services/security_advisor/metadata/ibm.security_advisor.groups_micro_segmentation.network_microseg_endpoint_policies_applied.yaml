title: Enforce Network Microsegmentation Endpoint Policies
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that network microsegmentation endpoint policies are applied is
  crucial for minimizing the attack surface within cloud environments. It helps in
  isolating workloads and limiting lateral movement in the event of a breach, thereby
  protecting sensitive data and maintaining business continuity. Implementing these
  policies can also aid in meeting regulatory compliance requirements by demonstrating
  effective network access control measures.
description: This rule verifies that endpoint policies for network microsegmentation
  are effectively applied within IBM Cloud environments. By assessing the presence
  and enforcement of these policies, the rule helps in enhancing network security
  by segmenting traffic and controlling inter-service communications. This practice
  not only bolsters security posture by reducing undue network exposure but also aligns
  with compliance frameworks that mandate strict access controls. The implementation
  of network microsegmentation helps organizations to achieve a more granular security
  approach, thereby improving overall data protection and compliance adherence.
