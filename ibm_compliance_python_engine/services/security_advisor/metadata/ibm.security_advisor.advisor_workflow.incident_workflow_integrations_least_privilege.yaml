title: Enforce Least Privilege for Incident Workflow Integrations
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for incident workflow integrations is crucial
  to minimize the potential attack surface within an organization. By ensuring that
  integrations have only the necessary access required to perform their tasks, businesses
  can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby protecting
  sensitive information and maintaining trust with customers and stakeholders.
description: This rule assesses the configuration of incident workflow integrations
  within IBM Cloud Security Advisor to ensure that only the minimum necessary permissions
  are granted. By enforcing least privilege, it ensures that integrations are not
  granted excessive permissions that could be exploited by malicious actors. This
  practice not only fortifies the security posture by limiting potential avenues for
  attack but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations
  that mandate restricted access to sensitive resources.
