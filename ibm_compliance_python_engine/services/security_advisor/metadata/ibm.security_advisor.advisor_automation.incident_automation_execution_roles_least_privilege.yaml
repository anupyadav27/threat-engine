title: Enforce Least Privilege for Incident Automation Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing least privilege for incident automation execution roles is critical
  to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By restricting
  permissions to only what is necessary, organizations can significantly reduce the
  attack surface and prevent malicious actors from exploiting overly permissive roles.
  This approach not only enhances security but also ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions assigned to incident automation execution
  roles within IBM Cloud's Security Advisor service to ensure they adhere to the principle
  of least privilege. It checks that roles only have the necessary permissions required
  to perform their specific tasks, thereby reducing the likelihood of privilege escalation
  attacks. By implementing this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture
  and align with compliance requirements such as ISO 27001 and GDPR, which mandate
  strict access controls and role-based permissions.
