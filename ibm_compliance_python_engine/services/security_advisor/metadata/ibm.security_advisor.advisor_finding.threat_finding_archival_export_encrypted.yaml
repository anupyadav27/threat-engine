title: Encrypted Export of Threat Finding Archival in Security Advisor
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing encryption on threat finding archival exports is crucial for
  safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized
  entities, it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys. This practice
  not only protects organizational data integrity but also aids in maintaining compliance
  with industry standards and regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that all exports of archived threat findings
  within the IBM Cloud Security Advisor are encrypted. By ensuring encryption at rest,
  the rule mitigates risks associated with data exposure during storage and transfer
  processes. Implementing this rule enhances overall data protection by preventing
  unauthorized access to sensitive threat intelligence and supports adherence to compliance
  frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate strict data protection
  measures.
