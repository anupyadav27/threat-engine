title: Ensure Vulnerability Patch Maintenance Windows Are Properly Configured
severity: medium
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Properly configuring vulnerability patch maintenance windows is crucial
  for minimizing security risks associated with unpatched software vulnerabilities.
  It ensures that patches are applied in a timely manner, reducing the potential attack
  surface and helping to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches. Additionally,
  well-planned maintenance windows minimize downtime and operational disruption, maintaining
  business continuity and compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks if vulnerability patch maintenance windows are configured
  on IBM Cloud instances, ensuring that critical and security patches can be applied
  without delay. By establishing regular maintenance windows, organizations can systematically
  manage patch deployments, thereby enhancing the security posture of their cloud
  environment. Implementing this practice aligns with industry best practices and
  compliance requirements, as it helps to maintain system integrity and protect sensitive
  data from emerging threats.
