title: Ensure Threat Finding Alert Destinations are Configured in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring alert destinations for threat findings is crucial for timely
  incident response and mitigation. Without proper alerting mechanisms, security teams
  may miss critical notifications regarding potential threats, leading to delayed
  responses and increased risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. Properly configured
  alert destinations enable organizations to maintain robust security postures and
  align with compliance requirements by ensuring that alerts are promptly received
  and addressed.
description: This rule checks whether alert destinations for threat findings in the
  IBM Security Advisor service are configured correctly. By verifying that alerts
  are directed to the appropriate channels, such as email or a security information
  and event management (SIEM) system, this configuration enhances the ability to manage
  and respond to security incidents effectively. Ensuring that threat alerts are promptly
  delivered to security teams helps in maintaining continuous monitoring and compliance
  with industry standards and best practices, thereby reducing the organization's
  exposure to potential threats.
