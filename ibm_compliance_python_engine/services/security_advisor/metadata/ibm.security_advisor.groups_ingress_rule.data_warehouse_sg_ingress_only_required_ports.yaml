title: 'Secure Ingress for Data Warehouse: Restrict to Essential Ports Only'
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Limiting ingress traffic to only essential ports for data warehouses is
  crucial in mitigating unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By enforcing
  tight control over network access, businesses can effectively protect sensitive
  data and comply with industry regulations, thus avoiding costly legal penalties
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule ensures that security groups associated with data warehouses
  in IBM Cloud only allow ingress traffic through ports that are essential for the
  service's operation. The rule checks the security group configurations to verify
  that only required ports are open, reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  access. Implementing this control enhances the overall security posture by aligning
  with best practices for data protection and complies with policies for encryption
  and secure data access.
