title: Ensure Vulnerability Patch Baseline is Defined for All OS Families
severity: medium
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Defining a vulnerability patch baseline for OS families is crucial for
  maintaining the security integrity of your IT infrastructure. It ensures that all
  systems are consistently updated against known vulnerabilities, reducing the risk
  of exploitation by malicious entities. This proactive approach not only protects
  sensitive data but also helps in maintaining business continuity by minimizing potential
  downtime caused by unpatched systems.
description: This rule checks whether a vulnerability patch baseline has been established
  for each operating system family within your IBM Cloud environment. By defining
  and enforcing a consistent patching policy, organizations can systematically address
  security vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing their overall security posture. This
  practice aligns with industry best practices and compliance frameworks, ensuring
  that all systems are adequately protected against emerging threats. Regular patching
  reduces the attack surface and is essential for compliance with regulatory standards,
  safeguarding both customer data and business operations.
