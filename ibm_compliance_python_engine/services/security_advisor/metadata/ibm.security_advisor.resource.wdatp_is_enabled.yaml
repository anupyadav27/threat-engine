title: Ensure Wdatp is Enabled for Enhanced Threat Detection
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Wdatp) is crucial
  for identifying and responding to security threats in real-time. It enhances the
  security posture by providing advanced threat analytics and monitoring capabilities,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and aiding regulatory compliance. Organizations
  can leverage Wdatp to maintain a proactive security stance, ensuring the integrity
  and confidentiality of their data assets.
description: This security rule verifies that Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
  (Wdatp) is enabled on relevant resources within the IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring
  Wdatp is active, organizations can benefit from continuous security monitoring and
  receive detailed threat intelligence, which helps to quickly identify and mitigate
  potential vulnerabilities. This proactive approach to threat management not only
  enhances overall security but also supports adherence to compliance frameworks by
  maintaining necessary security controls and documentation.
