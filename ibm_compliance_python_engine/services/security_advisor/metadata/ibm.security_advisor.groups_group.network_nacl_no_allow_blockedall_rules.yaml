title: Ensure Network ACLs Do Not Allow Blocked-All Traffic Rules
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing Network ACLs that block all traffic by default is crucial
  to maintaining a secure environment. This precaution minimizes unauthorized access
  and potential breaches by ensuring that only explicitly allowed traffic can traverse
  the network, thereby reducing the attack surface and protecting sensitive data.
  Organizations can mitigate risks associated with malicious activities and non-compliance
  penalties by enforcing strict access controls.
description: This rule verifies that Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) within the
  IBM Cloud are configured to deny all traffic unless explicitly permitted. It checks
  for the absence of rules that allow unrestricted inbound or outbound traffic, which
  can lead to significant security vulnerabilities. By adhering to this configuration,
  organizations enhance their security posture by ensuring that only vetted and necessary
  communications occur, aligning with best practices and regulatory requirements such
  as PCI DSS and HIPAA. The rule thereby aids in achieving compliance and fortifying
  the network against unauthorized access.
