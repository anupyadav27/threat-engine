title: Enforce Strict Network Access Control Policies in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing stringent network access controls is critical to safeguard
  cloud resources from unauthorized access and potential breaches. By ensuring that
  permissive "allow all" rules are blocked, organizations can prevent unintended exposure
  of sensitive resources, thus reducing the risk of data compromise and maintaining
  regulatory compliance.
description: This rule evaluates network access control configurations to detect and
  mitigate overly permissive policies, such as "permit all" rules within IBM Cloud
  environments. By identifying and blocking such configurations, this rule enhances
  security by limiting access to only authorized users and systems. This practice
  not only strengthens the overall security posture but also aligns with industry
  standards and compliance requirements, ensuring that only necessary and justified
  network access is permitted, thus minimizing the attack surface.
