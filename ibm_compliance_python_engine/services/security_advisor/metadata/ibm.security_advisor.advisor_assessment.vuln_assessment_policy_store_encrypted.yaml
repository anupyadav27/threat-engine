title: Ensure Vulnerability Assessment Policies Are Encrypted at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting vulnerability assessment policy data at rest is crucial to protect
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This
  practice helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of security assessments,
  reducing the risk of data exposure that could lead to reputational damage and financial
  losses for the organization.
description: This rule ensures that all vulnerability assessment policies stored within
  IBM Cloud Security Advisor are encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption, the data
  is protected from unauthorized access and tampering, enhancing the overall security
  posture of the organization. Adhering to this rule helps meet various compliance
  standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require encryption of sensitive data to
  safeguard privacy and data protection. Implementing this security control demonstrates
  a commitment to protecting customer data and upholding regulatory requirements.
