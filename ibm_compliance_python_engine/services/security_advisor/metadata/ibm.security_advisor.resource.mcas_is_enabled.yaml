title: Ensure IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is Enabled for Enhanced Security Monitoring
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is crucial for maintaining robust security
  monitoring and compliance in your cloud environment. By capturing API activities
  and user actions, it helps organizations detect unauthorized access and potential
  security breaches promptly. This proactive approach not only strengthens security
  posture but also aids in meeting regulatory compliance by providing a comprehensive
  audit trail.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is enabled, ensuring
  that all relevant user and API activities are logged and monitored. By enabling
  this service, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to suspicious
  activities quickly, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  access. Additionally, this service facilitates compliance with industry standards
  and regulations by providing detailed logs that can be used for audits and forensic
  analysis. It is a foundational element for implementing a robust security monitoring
  and compliance strategy within IBM Cloud environments.
