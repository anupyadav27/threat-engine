title: Ensure Network Monitoring Flow Logs are Enabled for Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling network monitoring flow logs is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into network traffic within your IBM Cloud environment. These logs provide insights
  into traffic patterns, helping detect anomalous activities and potential security
  threats. Without these logs, organizations may face challenges in identifying unauthorized
  access or breaches, impacting their security posture and compliance status.
description: This rule checks whether network monitoring flow logs are enabled for
  security groups within IBM Cloud. By enabling these logs, organizations can capture
  detailed information about traffic traversing their network, allowing for comprehensive
  security analysis and incident response. This enhances the ability to audit network
  traffic and supports compliance with various industry standards and regulations,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, by maintaining an accurate record of data flow and access.
