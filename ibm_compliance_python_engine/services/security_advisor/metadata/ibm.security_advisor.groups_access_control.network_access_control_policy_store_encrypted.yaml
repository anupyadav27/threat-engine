title: Ensure Network Access Control Policy Data is Encrypted at Rest
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Encrypting the network access control policy data at rest is crucial for
  protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Encryption ensures that even if the data storage is compromised, the information
  remains secure and unreadable without the proper encryption keys. This not only
  mitigates the risk of data exposure but also aligns with regulatory compliance requirements,
  safeguarding the organization's reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the network access control policy store within
  the IBM Cloud Security Advisor is encrypted at rest. Ensuring encryption of policy
  data enhances the security posture by preventing unauthorized access and manipulation,
  maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. This practice is a critical component
  of identity and access management, contributing to a robust authentication framework.
  Adhering to this rule provides compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  supporting the organization's overall security strategy.
