title: Enforce Least Privilege on Network Automation Remediation Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for network automation remediation
  roles is crucial for minimizing potential security risks. By restricting permissions
  to the minimum necessary, organizations can limit the exposure to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches, thereby protecting critical resources and maintaining
  operational integrity.
description: This security rule ensures that roles assigned for network automation
  remediation tasks within IBM Cloud adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege.
  It evaluates role permissions to confirm that only the necessary access is granted
  for the specific network remediation tasks. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can enhance their security posture by minimizing the attack surface, reducing the
  risk of privilege escalation, and ensuring compliance with industry standards such
  as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53, which advocate for stringent access control
  measures.
