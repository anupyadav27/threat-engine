title: Ensuring Trust in Threat Custom Identifier Sources
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Verifying the trustworthiness of sources for threat custom identifiers
  is crucial to maintaining an effective security posture. Utilizing unverified sources
  can lead to false positives or negatives, undermining threat detection and response
  efforts. Ensuring source trust helps organizations maintain accurate threat intelligence,
  reducing the risk of security breaches and non-compliance with regulatory standards.

  IBM Cloud's Security Advisor are verified for trustworthiness. By validating these
  sources, organizations can ensure that they are relying on credible and reliable
  threat intelligence data, which enhances their ability to detect and respond to
  security threats effectively. Trust verification of these sources not only bolsters
  security defenses but also aids in meeting compliance requirements by ensuring that
  the threat data used for security monitoring is accurate and reliable.
