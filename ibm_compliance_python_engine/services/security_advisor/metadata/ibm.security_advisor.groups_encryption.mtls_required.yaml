title: Enforce mTLS for Enhanced Encryption in IBM Cloud Security Advisor
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing mutual TLS (mTLS) for IBM Cloud Security Advisor ensures that
  data is encrypted during transmission, protecting sensitive information from interception
  and unauthorized access. This security measure is crucial for maintaining data integrity
  and privacy, which are foundational for compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  ultimately safeguarding business reputation and trust.
description: This rule mandates the use of mutual TLS (mTLS) for all communications
  related to the groups_encryption resource within IBM Cloud Security Advisor. By
  requiring mTLS, both the client and server mutually authenticate each other and
  establish an encrypted channel, significantly reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This practice not only enhances the security posture of your cloud environment
  by ensuring data confidentiality and integrity but also aids in meeting compliance
  requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations. Regular
  compliance checks and audits will verify adherence to these requirements, thereby
  bolstering your organization's overall data protection strategy.
