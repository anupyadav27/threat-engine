title: Ensure Vuln Baseline Exemptions Have Defined Expiry and Owner
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Defining expiry dates and ownership for vulnerability baseline exemptions
  is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. Without these
  controls, exemptions can persist indefinitely, potentially exposing the system to
  unmitigated vulnerabilities. Assigning ownership ensures accountability and timely
  reassessment of the exemption's validity, mitigating business risks associated with
  outdated security postures.
description: This rule verifies that all vulnerability baseline exemptions within
  IBM Cloud Security Advisor have specified expiry dates and designated owners. By
  enforcing these parameters, the rule enhances security posture management by ensuring
  that exemptions are periodically reviewed and either renewed or revoked. This practice
  aligns with compliance standards by instituting a systematic approach to managing
  exceptions, thereby reducing the risk of long-term exposure to vulnerabilities and
  ensuring accountability in security management processes.
