title: Ensure Encryption of Threat IP Set Storage in IBM Security Advisor
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting Threat IP Set storage in IBM Security Advisor is crucial to
  protect sensitive threat intelligence data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. By securing this data at rest, organizations can mitigate the risk of
  data theft, maintain customer trust, and comply with industry regulations and data
  protection laws.
description: This rule verifies that the storage of Threat IP Sets within IBM Security
  Advisor is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols. Encryption at
  rest ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable
  and secure. Implementing this practice enhances data protection, supports compliance
  with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, and fortifies the overall security posture
  of the cloud environment by safeguarding critical threat intelligence data from
  potential compromises.
