title: Ensure Threat Detector Findings are Exported to Encrypted Destinations
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting exported threat detector findings is crucial to safeguarding
  sensitive security data against unauthorized access. Without encryption, there is
  a potential risk of data exposure during transit or at rest, which could lead to
  compliance violations and damage to the organization’s reputation. Implementing
  encryption for these exports ensures that sensitive information remains protected,
  maintaining trust with stakeholders and adhering to data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that threat detector findings within the IBM Cloud
  Security Advisor are exported to destinations that implement encryption at rest.
  By ensuring that exports are encrypted, the risk of unauthorized data access is
  significantly reduced, enhancing the overall security posture. This practice also
  aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate
  encryption of sensitive data, thus safeguarding the organization's data assets.
