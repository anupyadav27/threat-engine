title: Configure Network Monitoring Alerts for Anomalies in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring network monitoring alerts for anomalies is essential for the
  early detection and response to potential security incidents. This practice helps
  in identifying unusual patterns or malicious activities in network traffic, which
  could indicate a breach or system compromise. By ensuring that alerts are configured,
  organizations can minimize downtime and protect sensitive data, thereby maintaining
  business continuity and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that network monitoring alerts for anomalies are properly
  configured in IBM Cloud Security Advisor. It involves setting up alerts to detect
  deviations from normal network behavior, such as unexpected traffic spikes or unauthorized
  access attempts. Implementing these alerts enhances security posture by facilitating
  timely incident response and reducing the risk of data breaches. Moreover, it assists
  organizations in meeting compliance requirements related to continuous monitoring
  and incident management, which are often mandated by various industry standards
  and regulations.
