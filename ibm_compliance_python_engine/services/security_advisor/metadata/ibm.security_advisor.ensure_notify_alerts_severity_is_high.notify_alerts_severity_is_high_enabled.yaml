title: Ensure High Severity Alerts Notifications Are Enabled in Security Advisor
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling notifications for high severity alerts is crucial as it ensures
  that critical security incidents are promptly detected and addressed, minimizing
  potential damage. By prioritizing high-severity alerts, organizations can concentrate
  their resources on responding to the most serious threats, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive data and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule checks whether notifications for high severity alerts are enabled
  in IBM Cloud Security Advisor. By ensuring these notifications are active, organizations
  gain immediate visibility into critical security issues, allowing for swift response
  and mitigation. This proactive approach not only enhances the overall security posture
  but also aids in compliance with industry standards and regulations by demonstrating
  due diligence in monitoring and responding to security threats.
