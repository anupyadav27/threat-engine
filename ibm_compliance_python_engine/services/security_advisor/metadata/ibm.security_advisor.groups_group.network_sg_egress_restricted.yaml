title: Egress Traffic Restriction for Enhanced Network Security
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting egress traffic from security groups is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  data exfiltration and to control outbound network activities. This ensures that
  only approved external communications are allowed, reducing the attack surface and
  mitigating risks associated with malicious activities.
description: This rule checks for security groups that have unrestricted egress rules,
  which could allow any outbound traffic. By ensuring egress restrictions, organizations
  can enforce stringent policies on outbound connections, limiting them to only necessary
  destinations. This approach minimizes potential vulnerabilities and helps maintain
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection.
  It also aids in better incident response by reducing the potential vectors for data
  breaches.
