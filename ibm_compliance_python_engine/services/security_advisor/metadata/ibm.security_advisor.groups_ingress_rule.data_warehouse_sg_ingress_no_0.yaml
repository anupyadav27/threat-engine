title: Restrict Unnecessary Ingress to Data Warehouse Security Groups
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: This rule is crucial for minimizing the attack surface of your data warehouse
  environments by ensuring that only necessary ingress traffic is permitted. By restricting
  overly permissive ingress rules, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data
  breaches, and potential exposure of sensitive information, thereby aligning with
  best practices for data protection and privacy.
description: The rule evaluates the ingress rules associated with data warehouse security
  groups to ensure they do not permit unrestricted access from the internet (e.g.,
  0.0.0.0/0). By enforcing tighter ingress controls, such as allowing only specific
  IP addresses or ranges, organizations can mitigate unauthorized access risks. This
  enhances overall security posture and aids in compliance with industry standards
  for encryption at rest and data protection. Properly configured ingress rules help
  maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored within IBM Cloud environments.
