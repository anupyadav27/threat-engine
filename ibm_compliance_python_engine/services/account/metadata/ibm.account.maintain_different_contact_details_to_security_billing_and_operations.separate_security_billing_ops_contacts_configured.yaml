title: Ensure Distinct Contacts for Security, Billing, and Operations
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Maintaining separate contact details for security, billing, and operations
  ensures that communications and alerts reach the appropriate individuals, thereby
  reducing the risk of miscommunication and enhancing the response time for critical
  issues. This separation of duties is essential for minimizing the risk of insider
  threats and ensures that sensitive tasks are handled by authorized personnel only,
  thereby maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of business operations.
description: This rule verifies that an IBM Cloud account has distinct contact information
  configured for security, billing, and operations roles. By segregating these roles,
  organizations can ensure that notifications and alerts are directed to the correct
  individuals, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of incident response.
  This practice aligns with industry standards for compliance and governance by promoting
  role-based access control and accountability. Implementing this separation helps
  maintain robust operational security and supports adherence to regulatory requirements.
