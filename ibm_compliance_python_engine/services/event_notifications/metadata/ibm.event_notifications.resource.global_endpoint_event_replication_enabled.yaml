rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.resource.global_endpoint_event_replication_enabled
title: Ensure Global Endpoint Event Replication is Enabled for Event Notifications
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling global endpoint event replication in IBM Cloud Event Notifications
  ensures that critical events are consistently replicated across multiple regions.
  This enhances fault tolerance and availability, reducing the risk of data loss or
  service disruption in the event of a regional failure. Moreover, it aligns with
  best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery, providing continuous
  service delivery and resilience.
description: This rule checks whether global endpoint event replication is enabled
  for resources within IBM Cloud Event Notifications. When enabled, event replication
  ensures that notifications are propagated across multiple geographic locations,
  enhancing the robustness and reliability of event-driven architectures. This configuration
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability across different regions,
  which is essential for compliance with data sovereignty regulations and for minimizing
  the impact of potential regional outages. By adopting such a configuration, organizations
  can improve their overall security posture and operational resilience.
