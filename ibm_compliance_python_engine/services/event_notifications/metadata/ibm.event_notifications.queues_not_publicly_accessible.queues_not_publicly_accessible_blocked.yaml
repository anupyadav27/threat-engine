title: Ensure Event Notification Queues Are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that event notification queues are not publicly accessible is
  crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted
  through these queues. Unauthorized access to these queues can lead to data breaches
  or unauthorized data manipulation, posing significant business and reputational
  risks. By blocking public access, organizations can safeguard sensitive information
  and comply with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks whether event notification queues are configured to
  block public access, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access
  the data within. By enforcing this configuration, organizations enhance their security
  posture by preventing potential unauthorized access and data exfiltration. This
  measure aligns with best practices in identity and access management, contributing
  to compliance with industry standards and regulations by ensuring that sensitive
  information is only accessible to those with a legitimate need.
