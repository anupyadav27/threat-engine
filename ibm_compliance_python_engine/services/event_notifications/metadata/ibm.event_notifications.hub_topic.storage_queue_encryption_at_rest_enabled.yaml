rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.hub_topic.storage_queue_encryption_at_rest_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for Event Notifications Hub Topic
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encryption at rest is critical for protecting sensitive data stored in
  storage queues, as it ensures that data is unreadable without proper decryption
  keys. This security measure mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access, reducing
  the potential impact of data breaches. Enforcing encryption at rest is essential
  for maintaining customer trust and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that storage queues associated with IBM Cloud
  Event Notifications Hub Topics have encryption at rest enabled. By enforcing encryption,
  the rule ensures that all data written to storage queues is automatically encrypted,
  thus safeguarding it against unauthorized access and potential data leaks. This
  practice enhances the overall security posture of the system and aids in achieving
  compliance with industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  mandate stringent data protection measures.
