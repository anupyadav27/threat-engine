title: Ensure Notifications Topic Subscription is Configured for Event Notifications
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that a notifications topic subscription is configured for IBM
  Event Notifications is crucial to maintain visibility and monitoring capabilities
  over cloud events. This configuration allows for proactive alerts and responses
  to potential security incidents or operational anomalies, thereby minimizing the
  risk of data breaches and ensuring business continuity. Without proper notifications,
  critical events may go unnoticed, leading to non-compliance with industry standards
  and potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether a notifications topic subscription is configured
  within IBM Event Notifications. By configuring subscriptions, organizations can
  ensure that they receive alerts for relevant events, which enhances their security
  monitoring posture. This setup allows security teams to react swiftly to suspicious
  activities, reducing the time to detect and respond to incidents. Furthermore, it
  supports compliance with regulatory requirements by providing an audit trail of
  events and notifications, thereby reinforcing governance and operational resilience.
