title: Ensure Server-Side Encryption for IBM Cloud Event Notifications Queues
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling server-side encryption for queues in IBM Cloud Event Notifications
  is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and breaches.
  Encryption at rest ensures that data remains protected even if the storage medium
  is compromised, thereby preserving data confidentiality and integrity. This is particularly
  important for meeting regulatory compliance requirements and maintaining customer
  trust.
description: This rule verifies that server-side encryption is enabled for queues
  within the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service. By enforcing encryption at rest,
  it ensures that all messages and data stored in queues are automatically encrypted
  using robust encryption standards provided by IBM Cloud. This layer of security
  mitigates the risk of data exposure and helps organizations comply with industry
  standards and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Implementing this control
  enhances the overall security posture by providing an additional layer of data protection
  in the cloud.
