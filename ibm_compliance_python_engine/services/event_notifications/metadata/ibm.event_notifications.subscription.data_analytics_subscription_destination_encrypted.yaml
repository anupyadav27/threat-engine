rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.subscription.data_analytics_subscription_destination_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption for Data Analytics Subscription Destinations
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data analytics subscription destinations is crucial for safeguarding
  sensitive information transmitted within the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service.
  Without encryption, data is vulnerable to unauthorized access and breaches, posing
  significant risks to business confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Ensuring
  that data is encrypted at rest helps maintain data integrity and trustworthiness
  while meeting industry and legal requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all data analytics subscription destinations
  within the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service have encryption enabled. By enforcing
  encryption at rest, the rule ensures that sensitive data is protected from potential
  threats and unauthorized access. Implementing encryption enhances the overall security
  posture of your cloud environment and aligns with best practices for data protection
  and privacy compliance. This not only mitigates risks associated with data breaches
  but also aids in meeting compliance standards, including GDPR and HIPAA.
