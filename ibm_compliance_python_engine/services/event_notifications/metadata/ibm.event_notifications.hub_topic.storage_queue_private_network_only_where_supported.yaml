rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.hub_topic.storage_queue_private_network_only_where_supported
title: Enforce Private Network Access for Storage Queues in Event Notifications
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that storage queues in Event Notifications are accessible only
  through private networks mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  This rule helps in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data
  by restricting exposure to the public internet, thereby enhancing the overall security
  posture of the organization's cloud environment.
description: This rule checks if storage queues associated with Event Notifications
  are configured to allow access exclusively from private networks where this configuration
  is supported. By enforcing private network access, the rule reduces the attack surface
  and limits potential entry points for malicious actors. Implementing this measure
  is crucial for compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements that
  mandate secure network access controls. Furthermore, it aligns with best practices
  for network security by minimizing unnecessary exposure to external threats.
