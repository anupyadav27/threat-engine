  best practices, reducing the risk of financial penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether encryption at rest is enabled for the streaming
  components of IBM Event Notifications topics. By ensuring that all stored data is
  encrypted, the rule enhances data protection and minimizes the risk of exposure
  in the event of a security incident. Enabling encryption at rest provides an additional
  layer of security, ensuring that data remains private and secure even if physical
  security measures are compromised. Compliance with this rule supports adherence
  to data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and industry standards like
  ISO 27001.
