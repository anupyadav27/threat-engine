title: Ensure Streaming Video Encryption at Rest is Enabled for Event Notifications
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for streaming video in event notifications

  customer trust by protecting their private information, which is critical for business
  continuity and reputation management.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for streaming
  video data within IBM Cloud's Event Notifications service. By ensuring encryption
  is implemented, the rule protects stored data from unauthorized access, mitigating
  the risk of data breaches. This measure aligns with compliance requirements for
  data protection, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by securing sensitive data against potential
  vulnerabilities and ensuring only authorized personnel can access it.
