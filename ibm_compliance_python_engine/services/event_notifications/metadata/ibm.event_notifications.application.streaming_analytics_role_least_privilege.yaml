rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.application.streaming_analytics_role_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Streaming Analytics Role in Event Notifications
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that the Streaming Analytics role operates under the principle
  of least privilege is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. By restricting permissions to the minimum necessary for
  functionality, organizations can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect
  sensitive data, thereby maintaining trust with clients and compliance with regulations.
description: This rule checks whether the Streaming Analytics role within IBM Cloud
  Event Notifications is configured to follow the principle of least privilege. The
  rule ensures that the role has only necessary permissions to perform its required
  functions, limiting access to sensitive resources. This approach not only enhances
  the security posture by reducing the likelihood of privilege escalation attacks
  but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and ISO
  27001, which mandate stringent access control measures.
