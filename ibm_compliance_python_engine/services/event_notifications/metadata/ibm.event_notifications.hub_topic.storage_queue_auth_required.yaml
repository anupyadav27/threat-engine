rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.hub_topic.storage_queue_auth_required
title: Ensure Storage Queue Authentication for Event Notifications Hub Topics
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enforcing authentication for storage queues associated with event notifications
  hub topics is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  This security measure ensures that only verified entities can interact with the
  data in the queue, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining the
  integrity of business operations.
description: This rule checks whether authentication is required for storage queues
  linked to IBM Cloud Event Notifications hub topics. By mandating authentication,
  the rule enhances the security posture of the event notification system by ensuring
  that access to storage resources is restricted to authorized users only. This not
  only protects data from unauthorized access but also aligns with compliance standards
  that mandate secure handling of data, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches
  and maintaining customer trust.
