rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.topic.streaming_stream_consumer_auth_required
title: Enforce Consumer Authentication for Streaming in Event Notifications
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that stream consumers are authenticated before accessing event
  notifications is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Without
  authentication, malicious actors could intercept or manipulate streaming data, leading
  to potential data breaches and compliance violations. By requiring authentication,
  businesses can maintain data integrity and trustworthiness while adhering to regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule checks whether streaming consumers accessing topics in IBM
  Cloud Event Notifications are required to authenticate. Enforcing authentication
  helps secure the data flow by ensuring that only authorized entities can consume
  the stream. This measure not only strengthens the overall security posture but also
  aids in compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which demand
  strict access controls for sensitive data. Implementing this rule enhances security
  monitoring by providing visibility into access patterns and potential anomalies.
