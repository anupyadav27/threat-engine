rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.application.streaming_analytics_network_private_only
title: Enforce Private Network for Streaming Analytics in Event Notifications
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Streaming Analytics applications are restricted to private
  networks mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. By enforcing
  private network configurations, organizations can protect sensitive data from exposure
  to public networks, thereby maintaining confidentiality and integrity, and meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks whether Streaming Analytics applications within IBM
  Cloud Event Notifications are configured to operate exclusively on private networks.
  By restricting the network access to private connections, it reduces the attack
  surface and prevents unauthorized external entities from accessing sensitive analytics
  data. This configuration enhances security by ensuring data traffic flows securely
  within controlled environments, aligning with best practices for network security
  and aiding in regulatory compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
