title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing for Data Analytics Subscriptions
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of data analytics subscriptions is crucial
  to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. Allowing
  unrestricted sharing can lead to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data
  breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations. Limiting this capability
  helps ensure that only authorized users within a trusted boundary can access and
  analyze the data.
description: This rule checks whether data analytics subscriptions within IBM Cloud
  Event Notifications are configured to restrict cross-account sharing. By enforcing
  this restriction, organizations can better control data access and ensure that sensitive
  information is not inadvertently exposed to unauthorized accounts. Implementing
  this rule enhances data privacy and supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate stringent data protection measures.
