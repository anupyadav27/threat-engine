rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.subscription.data_warehouse_subscription_cross_account_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Data Warehouse Subscriptions
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Data Warehouse subscriptions is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By limiting sharing
  capabilities, organizations can ensure that sensitive data remains protected within
  the intended account boundaries, thereby reducing the risk of data exfiltration
  and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks if cross-account sharing is restricted for Data Warehouse
  subscriptions within the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service. By enforcing this
  restriction, organizations can maintain tighter control over who has access to critical
  data stored in data warehouse subscriptions. This practice helps safeguard sensitive
  information, ensuring that only authorized accounts can access or manage the data.
  Implementing these controls not only strengthens the security posture but also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements related to data protection and privacy, particularly
  with regard to encryption at rest.
