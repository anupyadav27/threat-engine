title: Enforce Private Network Access for Event Notifications Storage Streams
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that event notifications' storage streams are accessible only
  via private networks is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data from potential exposure
  to unauthorized entities. By limiting access to private networks, organizations
  can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, thus
  maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of their information systems. This
  approach not only aligns with best practices in network security but also supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements for data protection.
description: This rule verifies that storage streams for event notifications topics
  are configured to restrict access exclusively through private networks where such
  configurations are supported. By implementing this control, organizations enhance
  their security posture by minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  access over public networks. This measure is integral to enforcing robust network
  security and access control policies, thereby contributing to overall compliance
  efforts with industry standards and regulations. Moreover, it ensures that data
  flowing through event notifications is shielded from potential external threats,
  thus maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
