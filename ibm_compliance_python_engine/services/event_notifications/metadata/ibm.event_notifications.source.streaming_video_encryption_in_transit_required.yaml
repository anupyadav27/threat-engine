title: Ensure Encryption In Transit for Streaming Video in Event Notifications
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting streaming video data in transit is critical to protecting sensitive
  information from interception and unauthorized access during transmission. This
  security measure not only safeguards user data integrity and privacy but also helps
  organizations comply with regulatory requirements, thereby avoiding potential legal
  and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that all streaming video sources within IBM Cloud
  Event Notifications are configured to use encryption protocols such as TLS 1.2 or
  higher. By ensuring encryption in transit, the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  data access is significantly reduced. Implementing this security control aligns
  with industry best practices and compliance standards, ensuring that sensitive information
  remains protected while being transmitted across networks.
