title: Ensure Streaming Firehose Destination Encryption in IBM Event Notifications
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting streaming firehose destinations in IBM Event Notifications is
  critical for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. Encryption at rest ensures that data stored within the cloud environment
  remains protected, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of customer information
  and complying with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all streaming firehose destinations configured
  within IBM Event Notifications are encrypted at rest. It checks whether encryption
  mechanisms are in place to secure data as it is stored in the cloud, thus preventing
  unauthorized access and data breaches. Implementing encryption at rest aligns with
  industry best practices and compliance standards, providing an additional layer
  of security and helping organizations meet regulatory requirements for data protection
  and privacy.
