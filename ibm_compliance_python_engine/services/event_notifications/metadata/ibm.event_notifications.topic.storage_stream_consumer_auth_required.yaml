rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.topic.storage_stream_consumer_auth_required
title: Ensure Authentication for Storage Stream Consumers in Event Notifications
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Ensuring authentication for storage stream consumers is crucial as it prevents
  unauthorized access to sensitive data being processed by the Event Notifications
  service. Without proper authentication, malicious actors could intercept or manipulate
  data streams, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions. Implementing
  this control helps maintain data integrity and availability, safeguarding business
  operations.
description: This security rule verifies that the storage stream consumers connected
  to an Event Notifications topic are authenticated. By enforcing authentication,
  the rule ensures that only verified users or services can access the data stream,
  reducing the risk of unauthorized data access. This safeguard aligns with best practices
  in storage and database security, enhancing the platform's overall compliance posture.
  Ensuring that only authorized consumers can interact with storage streams also supports
  regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy.
