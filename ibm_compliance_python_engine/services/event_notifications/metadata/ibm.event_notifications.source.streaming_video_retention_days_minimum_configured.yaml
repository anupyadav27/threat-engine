title: Enforce Minimum Retention Days for Streaming Video Sources
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring a minimum retention period for streaming video data in IBM Cloud
  Event Notifications is critical for maintaining regulatory compliance and supporting
  forensic investigations. Retaining video data for a sufficient duration helps organizations
  meet legal obligations and facilitates the identification and analysis of security
  incidents, ultimately safeguarding against data breaches and misuse.
description: This rule verifies that a configured minimum retention period is set
  for streaming video data sources within IBM Cloud Event Notifications. By enforcing
  this configuration, organizations can ensure adherence to compliance standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which often mandate specific data retention policies. Setting
  a minimum retention period not only aids in compliance but also enhances security
  monitoring capabilities, allowing for thorough review and investigation of security
  events over time.
