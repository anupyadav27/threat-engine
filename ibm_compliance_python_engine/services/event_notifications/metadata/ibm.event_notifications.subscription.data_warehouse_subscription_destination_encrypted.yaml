rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.subscription.data_warehouse_subscription_destination_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for Event Notifications Data Warehouse Subscriptions
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in Data Warehouse Subscription Destinations is
  critical to safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Encryption ensures that even if data storage is compromised, the
  information remains unreadable and protected, thereby maintaining confidentiality
  and integrity. This practice supports compliance with regulatory requirements and
  strengthens overall data security posture.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for Data Warehouse Subscription
  Destinations in IBM Cloud's Event Notifications service. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, organizations can protect their data against unauthorized access and meet
  various regulatory and compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Ensuring
  encryption not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but also enhances customer
  trust and confidence in the security of their data.
