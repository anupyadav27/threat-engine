rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.topic.streaming_stream_private_network_only_where_supported
title: Enforce Private Network for Streaming in Event Notifications Topics
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that streaming streams within IBM Cloud Event Notifications are
  limited to private networks helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data
  breaches. By confining data flow to a secure network, organizations can better protect
  sensitive information and comply with industry standards for data protection, ultimately
  reducing potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether streaming streams in IBM Cloud Event Notifications
  topics are configured to use only private networks, where supported. By enforcing
  private network access, the rule enhances security by limiting exposure to public
  networks, reducing the risk of interception or unauthorized access. This configuration
  aligns with best practices for network security and helps comply with regulatory
  requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, by ensuring data is transmitted in a controlled
  and secure manner.
