title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Analytics Subscription Destinations
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in IBM Cloud Event Notifications
  subscriptions is critical to minimizing security risks. By restricting access to
  only those permissions necessary for specific data analytics tasks, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thereby protecting
  sensitive information and maintaining compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule evaluates event notification subscriptions in IBM Cloud to
  ensure they are configured with the least privilege principle for data analytics
  destinations. It verifies that only essential permissions are granted, reducing
  the attack surface and ensuring that users or services cannot perform unauthorized
  actions. By enforcing strict access controls, this rule enhances the security posture
  of your cloud environment and supports compliance with security standards such as
  GDPR and ISO 27001. This proactive measure not only safeguards sensitive data but
  also helps organizations maintain trust with stakeholders.
