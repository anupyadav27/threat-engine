rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.destination.streaming_firehose_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Streaming Firehose Logging is Enabled for Event Notifications
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling streaming firehose logging for IBM Cloud Event Notifications ensures
  that all message delivery activities are tracked and logged. This is crucial for
  auditing purposes, helping organizations detect unauthorized access or anomalies
  in message deliveries, which could signify potential security breaches. Moreover,
  maintaining comprehensive logs aids in compliance with regulatory standards, safeguarding
  sensitive data and maintaining trust with clients and stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that streaming firehose logging is enabled for destinations
  in IBM Cloud Event Notifications. By enabling this logging feature, organizations
  can capture detailed logs of message delivery events, including successes and failures,
  which are vital for auditing and forensic investigations. This enhances the visibility
  of notification transactions and supports the identification of security incidents.
  Moreover, it aligns with best practices for audit logging, supporting compliance
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA by providing a robust record of data movements
  and access patterns.
