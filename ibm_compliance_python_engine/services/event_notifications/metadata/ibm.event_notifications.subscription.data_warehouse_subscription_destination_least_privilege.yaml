title: Enforce Least Privilege for Data Warehouse Event Notification Subscriptions
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle for data warehouse subscriptions
  in IBM Cloud Event Notifications minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By restricting permissions to only what is necessary, organizations
  can protect sensitive data, ensure compliance with regulations, and reduce the attack
  surface, thus enhancing overall cloud security posture.
description: This rule evaluates the permissions associated with data warehouse subscription
  destinations within IBM Cloud Event Notifications, ensuring they adhere to the principle
  of least privilege. It checks if subscriptions are granted only the minimum necessary
  access rights to perform their functions. Enforcing least privilege helps in mitigating
  risks associated with excessive permissions, preventing potential misuse or exploitation
  of data warehouse resources. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry
  standards and regulatory requirements, bolstering both security and trust in cloud
  operations.
