rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.hub_topic.storage_queue_cross_account_send_receive_restricted
title: Restrict Cross-Account Access to Event Notifications Storage Queues
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Limiting cross-account send and receive permissions on storage queues within
  IBM Cloud Event Notifications is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data
  breaches. By restricting these permissions, organizations can safeguard sensitive
  data and maintain control over who can interact with their event-driven architecture,
  thus ensuring compliance with internal security policies and regulatory standards.
description: This rule evaluates the configuration of storage queues associated with
  IBM Cloud Event Notifications to ensure that cross-account send and receive permissions
  are restricted. By enforcing access control measures, this rule helps in mitigating
  the risk of data exposure and unauthorized data manipulation. Implementing this
  security measure aligns with best practices for data protection and supports compliance
  with industry regulations by ensuring that only authorized accounts can interact
  with the storage queues, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the cloud
  environment.
