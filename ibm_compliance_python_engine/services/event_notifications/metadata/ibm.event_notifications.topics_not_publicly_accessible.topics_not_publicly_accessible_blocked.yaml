title: Prevent Public Accessibility of IBM Cloud Event Notifications Topics
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Cloud Event Notifications topics are not publicly accessible
  is crucial to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your cloud environment.
  Public accessibility could expose sensitive data and system operations to unauthorized
  users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. Protecting
  these topics mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and aligns with best practices
  for secure cloud operations.
description: This security rule verifies that topics within IBM Cloud Event Notifications
  are configured to prevent public access. By blocking public accessibility, the rule
  enforces strict access controls, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized
  users can interact with the topics. This enhances the security posture by safeguarding
  data and communication processes against unauthorized exposure. Implementing this
  measure supports compliance with industry regulations and standards, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access controls over sensitive data.
