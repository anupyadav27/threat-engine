title: Ensure KMS Encryption for IBM Event Notifications Topics at Rest
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for topics at rest in
  IBM Event Notifications ensures that sensitive data is protected against unauthorized
  access. This security measure mitigates potential data breaches and aligns with
  regulatory compliance, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of critical
  business information.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for all topics within
  IBM Event Notifications, ensuring data at rest is encrypted using a customer-managed
  key. By enforcing encryption at rest, organizations can enhance their data protection
  strategy, reduce the risk of data exposure, and comply with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Enabling this feature through IBM Cloud's KMS provides centralized
  key management and audit capabilities, improving security posture and operational
  resilience.
