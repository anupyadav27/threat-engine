title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for IBM Event Notifications Keys
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for IBM Event Notifications keys is critical
  for safeguarding sensitive data. This practice ensures that data remains protected
  from unauthorized access, even if physical storage is compromised. By securing data
  at rest, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches and ensure compliance
  with industry regulations, ultimately protecting their brand reputation and customer
  trust.
description: This rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for keys used within
  the IBM Event Notifications service. By utilizing IBM Cloud Key Protect or equivalent
  encryption services, data at rest is encrypted, ensuring that it remains inaccessible
  to unauthorized users. This enhancement not only improves the security posture by
  protecting sensitive information but also aids in meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing this security measure helps organizations demonstrate
  their commitment to data protection and privacy.
