rule_id: ibm.event_notifications.application.streaming_analytics_checkpoints_and_outputs_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Streaming Analytics Checkpoints and Outputs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting streaming analytics checkpoints and outputs is crucial for safeguarding
  sensitive data processed within IBM Cloud Event Notifications. Without encryption,
  data is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential breaches, which can lead
  to compliance violations and damage to the organization's reputation. Ensuring data
  encryption at rest helps maintain confidentiality and trust with clients and partners.
description: This rule verifies that all streaming analytics checkpoints and outputs
  within the IBM Cloud Event Notifications service are encrypted. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, this rule helps protect data from unauthorized access and ensures compliance
  with data protection regulations. Encryption provides a critical layer of security
  that enhances the overall security posture by preventing exposure of sensitive information.
  Implementing this rule aligns with best practices in data protection and privacy,
  ensuring data integrity and confidentiality are maintained.
