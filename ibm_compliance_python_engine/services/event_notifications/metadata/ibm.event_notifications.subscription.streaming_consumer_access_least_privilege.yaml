title: Enforce Least Privilege for Streaming Consumer Access in Event Notifications
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that streaming consumers in IBM Cloud Event Notifications operate
  with the least privilege is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized data
  access and potential security breaches. By restricting permissions, organizations
  can safeguard sensitive information, maintain data integrity, and comply with regulatory
  requirements, reducing the likelihood of costly data breaches and ensuring operational
  continuity.
description: This rule verifies that streaming consumers within IBM Cloud Event Notifications
  have permissions strictly limited to the necessary scope for their function. By
  adhering to the principle of least privilege, this rule helps prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data leaks, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
  Implementing least privilege access controls aligns with compliance standards, such
  as GDPR and CCPA, by ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific
  data and operations, thus reducing the attack surface.
