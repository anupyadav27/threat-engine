title: Ensure Broker Logging is Enabled for IBM Event Streams Queue Manager
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling broker logging for IBM Event Streams queue managers is critical
  for maintaining a robust security posture. It allows for the capture of detailed
  operational data and security events, which is essential for auditing, incident
  response, and compliance with industry standards. Without logging, detecting and
  investigating unauthorized access or system anomalies becomes challenging, potentially
  leading to data breaches or operational disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that broker logging is enabled for the queue manager
  within IBM Event Streams. By ensuring logging is active, organizations can track
  and document all actions performed by the broker, which aids in identifying suspicious
  activities and supports compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA. Enabling logging enhances the organization's ability to perform thorough
  audits, monitor system performance, and implement effective security measures, thereby
  reducing the risk of undetected security incidents and ensuring accountability.
