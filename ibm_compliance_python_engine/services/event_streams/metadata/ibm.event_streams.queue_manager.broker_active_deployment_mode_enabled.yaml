rule_id: ibm.event_streams.queue_manager.broker_active_deployment_mode_enabled
title: Ensure Broker Active Deployment Mode is Enabled for Event Streams
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Broker Active Deployment Mode in IBM Event Streams ensures high
  availability and resilience of message processing. This configuration is crucial
  for maintaining uninterrupted service and reducing the risk of message delivery
  failures, which can lead to business disruptions and data inconsistencies.
description: This rule checks if the Broker Active Deployment Mode is enabled for
  the queue manager within IBM Event Streams. By ensuring this mode is active, the
  rule enhances fault tolerance and load balancing, thereby maintaining system stability
  in the event of hardware or network failures. Enabling this mode is also a best
  practice for compliance with industry standards for reliability and security in
  containerized environments, aligning with Kubernetes security benchmarks.
