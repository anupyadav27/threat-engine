rule_id: ibm.event_streams.resource.stream_encrypted_at_rest
title: Ensure Event Streams Data is Encrypted at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive information
  against unauthorized access or breaches. This ensures that even if physical security
  measures are compromised, the data remains inaccessible without the appropriate
  encryption keys. Organizations benefit from reduced risk of data exposure and increased
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all data stored within IBM Event Streams resources
  is encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption, the integrity and confidentiality
  of the data are maintained, protecting it from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This practice aligns with data protection laws and industry standards,
  providing peace of mind that sensitive information is secured. Implementing this
  rule helps organizations adhere to compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  require stringent data protection measures.
