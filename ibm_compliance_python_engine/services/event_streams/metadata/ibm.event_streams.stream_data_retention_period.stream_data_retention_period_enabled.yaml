title: Ensure Stream Data Retention Period is Enabled for IBM Event Streams
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling the data retention period for IBM Event Streams is vital for maintaining
  data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations. It ensures that data
  is not retained longer than necessary, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  access to historical data. Proper data retention settings help businesses avoid
  potential fines and reputational damage associated with non-compliance.
description: This rule checks whether the stream data retention period is enabled
  and properly configured in IBM Event Streams. By enforcing a data retention policy,
  organizations can automatically delete or archive data after a specified period,
  thereby minimizing data exposure risk. This measure enhances the security of data
  at rest by ensuring that obsolete data is not unnecessarily stored, aligning with
  best practices in data protection and privacy compliance frameworks. This also facilitates
  efficient data management and reduces storage costs.
