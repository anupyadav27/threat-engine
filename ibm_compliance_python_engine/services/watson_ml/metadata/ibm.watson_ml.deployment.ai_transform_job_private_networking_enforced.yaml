title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Transform Jobs in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Transform Jobs ensures that data processed
  by Watson Machine Learning deployments remains within a secure network boundary,
  reducing exposure to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice
  is essential for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, especially when
  handling sensitive or proprietary information.
description: This rule checks that AI Transform Jobs within Watson Machine Learning
  deployments are configured to use private networking, thereby restricting network
  access to internal IBM Cloud networks. By enforcing private networking, the rule
  ensures that data traffic does not traverse the public internet, minimizing the
  risk of interception or unauthorized access. Implementing this rule supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulatory requirements by enhancing the overall security
  posture of the deployment's network configuration.
