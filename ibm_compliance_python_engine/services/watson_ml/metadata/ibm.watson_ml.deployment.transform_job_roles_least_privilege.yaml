rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.transform_job_roles_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege on Watson ML Deployment Transform Jobs
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Watson Machine Learning
  deployment transform jobs is critical to minimizing potential security risks. By
  restricting access to only necessary roles, organizations can reduce the attack
  surface, prevent unauthorized access, and protect sensitive data from being exposed
  or manipulated, thus ensuring compliance with security standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks that Watson Machine Learning deployment transform jobs
  are configured with the least privilege principle in mind, ensuring that only essential
  roles have access to the resources needed for their specific tasks. By enforcing
  stringent access controls, this rule helps safeguard the integrity and confidentiality
  of machine learning models and data, aligning with best practices in identity and
  access management. Compliance with this rule strengthens the overall security posture
  and supports adherence to regulatory requirements by demonstrating robust access
  control measures.
