title: Ensure Least Privilege for AI Services Model Execution Role
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in AI services model execution
  roles is crucial to minimize potential security risks. By restricting access to
  only the necessary permissions, organizations can significantly reduce the attack
  surface and prevent unauthorized access or actions that could lead to data breaches
  or service disruptions, thus protecting sensitive business information and maintaining
  operational integrity.
description: This rule checks that AI services model execution roles in IBM Watson
  Machine Learning are configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege. It
  ensures that these roles are granted only the permissions necessary for their intended
  function, thereby enhancing security by limiting exposure to potential threats.
  By complying with this rule, organizations can align with best practices in identity
  and access management, reducing the risk of privilege escalation attacks and ensuring
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
