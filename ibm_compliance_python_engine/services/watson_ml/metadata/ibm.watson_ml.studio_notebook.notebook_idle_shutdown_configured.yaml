title: Ensure Idle Shutdown Configuration for IBM Watson Studio Notebooks
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring idle shutdown for notebooks in IBM Watson Studio is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access and reduce unnecessary resource consumption. By automatically
  shutting down idle notebooks, organizations can minimize the risk of data exposure
  and optimize their cloud costs, contributing to a more secure and efficient cloud
  environment.
description: This rule verifies that idle shutdown is configured for notebooks within
  IBM Watson Studio, ensuring that any notebook session is automatically terminated
  after a specified period of inactivity. This configuration helps mitigate potential
  security risks by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and computational
  resources when notebooks are left unattended. Enabling idle shutdown aligns with
  compliance best practices by enforcing security policies that protect sensitive
  workloads and support governance requirements.
