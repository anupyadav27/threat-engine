title: Ensure Private Network Access for Watson ML Studio Workspaces
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting network access to private connections for Watson ML Studio
  workspaces is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining integrity in
  data analysis processes. Public network exposure can lead to unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and potential loss of intellectual property, impacting business operations
  and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that the network access for data analytics workgroups
  within Watson ML Studio workspaces is configured to use private network connections.
  By ensuring that only private network access is allowed, this rule minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized exposure and access to critical data assets. Implementing private
  network access also aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  for data protection, enhancing overall security posture and compliance with standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
