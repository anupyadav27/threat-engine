title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Experiment RBAC in Watson ML
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that AI experiment roles in Watson Machine Learning (ML) adhere
  to the principle of least privilege is crucial for maintaining a robust security
  posture. Over-privileged access can lead to unauthorized data exposure and potential
  compromise of sensitive AI models, which in turn can have significant business and
  reputational impacts.
description: This security rule mandates the application of the least privilege principle
  for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the Watson Machine Learning studio experiments.
  It checks that users and service identities have only the permissions necessary
  to perform their specific tasks. By limiting access rights to only those essential
  for job functions, this rule minimizes the attack surface, reducing the risk of
  accidental or malicious data breaches. Compliance with this rule supports adherence
  to regulatory standards and enhances the overall security framework of the IBM Cloud
  environment.
