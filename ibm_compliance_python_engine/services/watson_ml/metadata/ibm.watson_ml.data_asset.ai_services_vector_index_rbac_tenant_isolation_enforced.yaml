title: Ensure RBAC Tenant Isolation for AI Services Vector Index in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for tenant isolation in AI Services
  Vector Index is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data assets
  within the Watson Machine Learning (ML) service. This rule ensures that only authorized
  users within a specific tenant can access and manage AI vector indices, thereby
  reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining data privacy. Effective RBAC
  implementation supports compliance with regulatory requirements and enhances trust
  with stakeholders by safeguarding proprietary and sensitive information.
description: This security rule checks that RBAC tenant isolation is enforced for
  AI Services Vector Index within Watson Machine Learning data assets. By implementing
  tenant-specific access controls, the rule ensures that users can only access resources
  associated with their tenant, thus preventing cross-tenant data access or manipulation.
  This isolation is critical in multi-tenant cloud environments where multiple organizations
  share the same infrastructure, as it helps maintain data integrity and privacy.
  Adhering to this rule not only strengthens the security posture but also aids in
  compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA by demonstrating robust access
  control measures.
