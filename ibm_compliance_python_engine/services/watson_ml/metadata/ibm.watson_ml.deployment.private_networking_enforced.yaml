title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Deployments
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Watson Machine Learning deployments is
  crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It ensures that
  sensitive data and machine learning models are only accessible within a secure,
  controlled environment, mitigating the risk of exposure to external threats. This
  practice supports the integrity and confidentiality of data, which is essential
  for maintaining customer trust and compliance with industry regulations.
description: This security rule checks that all Watson Machine Learning deployments
  are configured to use private networking. By enforcing private networking, deployments
  are restricted to internal network traffic, reducing the attack surface and limiting
  exposure to potential threats from public internet sources. This enhances overall
  security posture by ensuring that only authorized users and systems within the private
  network can access the deployed resources. Compliance with this rule aligns with
  best practices for network security and helps organizations adhere to regulatory
  requirements for data protection.
