title: Enforce Least Privilege for Watson ML AI Transform Job Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the principle of least privilege for AI Transform Job roles in
  Watson Machine Learning deployments is crucial to minimize security risks. By ensuring
  that roles only have permissions necessary for their tasks, you reduce the attack
  surface and potential for unauthorized access, thereby protecting sensitive data
  and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that role-based access controls (RBAC) within Watson
  Machine Learning deployments are configured to adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. It checks that AI Transform Job roles are limited to only the permissions
  required for their specific functions. This approach enhances security by preventing
  excessive permissions that could be exploited by malicious actors. Furthermore,
  it supports compliance with data protection standards by ensuring only authorized
  access to critical resources.
