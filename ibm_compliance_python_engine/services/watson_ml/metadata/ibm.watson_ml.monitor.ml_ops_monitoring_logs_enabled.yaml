title: Ensure MLOps Monitoring Logs are Enabled for IBM Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling MLOps monitoring logs is critical for maintaining the integrity
  and security of machine learning operations. By capturing detailed logs, organizations
  can trace and audit activities, detect anomalies, and ensure compliance with regulatory
  requirements. This enhances both operational transparency and the ability to respond
  effectively to security incidents, minimizing potential business disruptions.
description: This rule checks that logging for machine learning operations (MLOps)
  is enabled within IBM Watson Machine Learning's monitoring component. By ensuring
  that comprehensive logs are maintained, organizations can track and audit all interactions
  and changes to their machine learning models. This capability not only supports
  proactive security measures by identifying unauthorized access attempts but also
  aids in compliance with data protection regulations by providing a traceable history
  of ML operations. Enabling logging enhances overall security posture by facilitating
  real-time alerting and post-incident forensic analysis.
