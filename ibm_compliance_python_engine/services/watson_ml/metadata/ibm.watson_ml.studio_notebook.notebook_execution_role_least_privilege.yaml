title: Ensure Least Privilege for Watson Studio Notebook Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing least privilege for Watson Studio notebook execution roles is
  crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By restricting permissions to only what is necessary, organizations can safeguard
  sensitive data and maintain the integrity of their machine learning workflows, reducing
  the likelihood of malicious exploitation or inadvertent data exposure.
description: This rule verifies that Watson Studio notebook execution roles adhere
  to the principle of least privilege by ensuring roles are granted only the permissions
  necessary for executing tasks within the notebooks. This approach enhances security
  by limiting access to resources and potential attack surfaces, thereby protecting
  sensitive business data and meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  By implementing this rule, organizations can ensure that their data processing activities
  within Watson Studio are both secure and compliant with industry standards.
