rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.machine_learning_training_job.input_output_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption for Watson ML Training Job Data
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting input and output data of Watson Machine Learning (ML) training
  jobs is crucial to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and data
  breaches. Compliance with encryption standards mitigates risks associated with data
  leaks, ensuring business continuity and maintaining customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that all input and output data associated
  with Watson ML training jobs are encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption, the
  rule helps safeguard sensitive datasets, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring
  data integrity. Implementing encryption aligns with industry best practices and
  regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, enhancing overall security posture
  and compliance.
