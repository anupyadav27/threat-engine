title: Ensure AI Model Packages are Encrypted at Rest in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI model packages at rest is crucial to safeguarding sensitive
  intellectual property and client data, preventing unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. Implementing encryption enhances the confidentiality and integrity
  of AI models, thereby ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that AI model packages within the IBM Watson Machine
  Learning service are encrypted at rest, employing robust encryption algorithms.
  Encryption at rest ensures that data stored in the cloud remains protected even
  if physical security measures are compromised, mitigating risks associated with
  unauthorized data access. By enforcing this rule, organizations can achieve a stronger
  security posture, align with regulatory requirements, and demonstrate a commitment
  to protecting sensitive information in their AI workflows.
