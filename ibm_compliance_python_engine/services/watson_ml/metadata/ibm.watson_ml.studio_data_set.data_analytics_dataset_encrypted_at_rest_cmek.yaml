title: Ensure Data Analytics Dataset Encryption at Rest with CMEK
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) is
  crucial for maintaining confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data within Watson
  Machine Learning. This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and
  provides organizations with greater control over their encryption keys, thereby
  enhancing compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards.
description: This security rule verifies that all datasets within IBM Watson Machine
  Learning's Studio are encrypted at rest using Customer Managed Encryption Keys.
  By ensuring that data is encrypted at rest, organizations can protect against data
  breaches and unauthorized access, even if physical storage devices are compromised.
  Implementing CMEK allows for enhanced security control, as customers can manage,
  rotate, and revoke their encryption keys according to their security policies, aligning
  with compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others.
