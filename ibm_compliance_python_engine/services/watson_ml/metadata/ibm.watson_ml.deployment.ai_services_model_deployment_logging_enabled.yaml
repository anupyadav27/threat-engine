title: Ensure AI Model Deployment Logging is Enabled in IBM Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for AI model deployments in IBM Watson Machine Learning
  is crucial for maintaining visibility and accountability. It helps in detecting
  unauthorized access attempts and operational issues, which can prevent potential
  data breaches and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Proper logging
  also facilitates auditing and forensic analysis, thereby supporting the organization's
  security posture.
description: This rule verifies that logging is activated for AI services model deployments
  within IBM Watson Machine Learning. Enabling comprehensive logging captures critical
  events and actions, such as model predictions and administrative changes, enhancing
  the ability to monitor and respond to suspicious activities. This practice not only
  strengthens security by enabling rapid threat detection and response but also supports
  adherence to compliance standards by maintaining a detailed audit trail of all operations.
