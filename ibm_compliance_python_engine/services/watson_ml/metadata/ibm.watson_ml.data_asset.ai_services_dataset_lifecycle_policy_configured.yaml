title: Ensure AI Services Dataset Lifecycle Policy is Configured
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring a dataset lifecycle policy within AI services ensures that
  data assets are managed effectively throughout their lifecycle, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access or data breaches. Proper lifecycle management facilitates
  compliance with regulatory standards and enhances data governance, contributing
  to the overall security posture of the organization.
description: This rule checks whether a lifecycle policy is configured for data assets
  used by AI services in Watson Machine Learning. By implementing a lifecycle policy,
  organizations can automate the management of data retention, archival, and deletion
  processes, thereby minimizing the risk of data exposure and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations. This practice not only enhances the security and
  integrity of data but also supports operational efficiency and resource optimization
  by automating routine data management tasks.
