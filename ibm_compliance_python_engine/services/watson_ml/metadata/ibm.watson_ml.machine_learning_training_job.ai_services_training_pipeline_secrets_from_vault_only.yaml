rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.machine_learning_training_job.ai_services_training_pipeline_secrets_from_vault_only
title: Enforce Vault-Only Secrets in Watson ML Training Pipelines
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that AI service training pipelines within Watson Machine Learning
  only retrieve secrets from IBM Cloud's Vault enhances security by centralizing and
  controlling access to sensitive information. This practice mitigates the risk of
  unauthorized access or data leaks, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of machine learning models and datasets, which are critical to business success.
description: This rule mandates that all secrets used in Watson Machine Learning training
  jobs must be sourced exclusively from IBM Cloud's Vault service. By enforcing the
  use of Vault, organizations benefit from robust secret management capabilities that
  include encryption, audit logging, and fine-grained access controls. This approach
  not only aligns with industry best practices for secrets management but also supports
  compliance with various regulatory standards by ensuring that sensitive information
  is securely managed and accessed only by authorized entities.
