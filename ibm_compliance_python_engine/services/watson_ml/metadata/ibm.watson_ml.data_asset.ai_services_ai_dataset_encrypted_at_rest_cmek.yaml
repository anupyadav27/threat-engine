title: Ensure AI Dataset Encryption at Rest with Customer-Managed Keys
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI datasets at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
  is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. It allows organizations
  to have greater control over their encryption keys, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and ensuring compliance with stringent data protection regulations. This
  practice helps mitigate potential data breaches and safeguards sensitive information
  from exposure.
description: This rule verifies that AI datasets associated with the Watson Machine
  Learning service are encrypted at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).
  By leveraging CMEK, clients retain exclusive control over the encryption keys used
  to protect their datasets, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access.
  This approach aligns with best practices for data protection and assists organizations
  in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate robust
  encryption measures for sensitive data.
