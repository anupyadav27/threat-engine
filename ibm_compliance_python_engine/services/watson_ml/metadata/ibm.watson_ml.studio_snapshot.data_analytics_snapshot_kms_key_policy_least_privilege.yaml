title: Enforce Least Privilege for KMS Key in Watson ML Studio Snapshots
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing a least privilege policy for KMS keys used in Watson ML Studio
  Snapshots is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  By restricting access, organizations can protect their data from potential breaches
  and ensure compliance with regulatory standards, thereby maintaining customer trust
  and safeguarding business reputation.
description: This security rule checks that the Key Management Service (KMS) keys
  associated with Watson ML Studio Snapshots adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It ensures that only authorized entities have the necessary permissions to manage
  or use these keys, thereby reducing the exposure to potential data leaks. Implementing
  this policy enhances the security posture by ensuring that encryption at rest is
  effectively managed, aligning with best practices for data protection and regulatory
  compliance.
