rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.endpoint_config_prod_variant_instances.endpoint_config_prod_variant_instances_enabled
title: Ensure Watson ML Endpoint Config Prod Variant Instances are Enabled
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling endpoint configuration for production variant instances in Watson
  Machine Learning is crucial for maintaining secure and controlled access to machine
  learning models. This configuration helps in managing network access control, thereby
  reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. It also ensures
  that production environments adhere to compliance requirements, which is vital for
  business continuity and trust.
description: This rule verifies that endpoint configuration for production variant
  instances in Watson Machine Learning is enabled. By ensuring these configurations
  are active, the security posture is enhanced through the establishment of controlled
  network access to machine learning resources. This not only helps in safeguarding
  sensitive data but also aligns with best practices for network security and compliance.
  Enabling these configurations supports adherence to industry standards and regulatory
  requirements, providing a robust framework for secure machine learning operations
  on IBM Cloud.
