rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.resource.model_invocation_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Model Invocation Logging is Enabled for Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling model invocation logging for Watson Machine Learning is crucial
  for auditing and monitoring purposes. It helps organizations track usage patterns,
  detect anomalies, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Without logging,
  it becomes challenging to investigate incidents or demonstrate adherence to data
  protection standards.
description: This rule verifies that model invocation logging is enabled for Watson
  Machine Learning resources. By ensuring that all model invocations are logged, organizations
  can maintain a comprehensive audit trail. This logging capability enhances security
  by providing visibility into model usage, facilitating incident response, and supporting
  compliance with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Enabling logging also
  aids in performance monitoring and optimization by providing valuable insights into
  model interactions.
