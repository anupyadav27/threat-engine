rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.config_data_capture_encrypted
title: Ensure Data Capture Encryption in Watson ML Deployments
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting configuration data capture in Watson ML deployments ensures
  that sensitive information remains protected against unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This practice is crucial for maintaining customer trust and complying
  with regulatory requirements around data protection and privacy. Encryption at rest
  prevents data exposure even if storage devices are compromised.
description: This rule verifies that configuration data captured in Watson ML deployments
  is encrypted at rest, aligning with best practices in data protection and privacy.
  By ensuring encryption, organizations can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized
  data access and enhance their overall security posture. Compliance with this rule
  supports adherence to industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate robust data protection measures. The rule checks the encryption settings
  of the deployment resources to confirm that they meet the necessary security standards,
  providing peace of mind and reinforcing data confidentiality.
