rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.ai_pipeline_artifacts_private_and_encrypted
title: Ensure AI Pipeline Artifacts are Private and Encrypted in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting AI pipeline artifacts is crucial to safeguarding sensitive data
  and intellectual property. Unencrypted or publicly accessible artifacts can lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations, thereby posing
  a significant risk to business operations and reputational integrity.
description: This rule verifies that all AI pipeline artifacts within IBM Watson Machine
  Learning are configured to be private and encrypted at rest. By ensuring these artifacts
  are not publicly accessible and are encrypted, organizations can align with data
  protection standards and reduce the risk of unauthorized data exposure. This enhances
  the overall security posture by ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
