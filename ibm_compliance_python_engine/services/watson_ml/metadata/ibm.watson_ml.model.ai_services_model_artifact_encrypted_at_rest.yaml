title: Ensure AI Model Artifacts are Encrypted at Rest in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI model artifacts at rest is crucial to safeguarding sensitive
  data from unauthorized access, breaches, and potential data theft. By implementing
  encryption, organizations can maintain data integrity and confidentiality, ensuring
  compliance with industry standards and regulations. This practice not only protects
  intellectual property but also reinforces customer trust by demonstrating a commitment
  to data security.
description: This rule verifies that all AI model artifacts within IBM Watson Machine
  Learning are encrypted at rest, ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized
  access while stored on disk. Encryption at rest is a critical security control that
  mitigates the risk of data exposure in case of infrastructure compromise. By encrypting
  data at rest, organizations align with compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and other data protection regulations, enhancing their overall security posture
  and reducing legal liabilities associated with data breaches.
