rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.data_asset.ai_services_dataset_s3_block_public_access
title: Enforce S3 Block Public Access for AI Service Datasets in IBM Watson ML
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that AI service datasets stored in S3 buckets are not publicly
  accessible is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. This rule mitigates the risk of exposing confidential machine
  learning data, which could lead to competitive disadvantages or regulatory non-compliance,
  impacting business integrity and customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that S3 buckets containing datasets for AI
  services within IBM Watson Machine Learning have public access blocked. By enforcing
  this restriction, the rule helps prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive
  data assets stored in the cloud. Implementing this control enhances the security
  posture by aligning with best practices in identity and access management, thereby
  supporting compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
