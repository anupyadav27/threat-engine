title: Ensure Isolation of Secrets in AI Services Agent Orchestrator for Watson ML
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Enabling secrets isolation in the AI Services Agent Orchestrator is crucial
  for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. This
  ensures that secrets used in AI pipelines are isolated from unauthorized access,
  mitigating the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data manipulation. Businesses
  can prevent potential financial and reputational damage by ensuring that only authorized
  components access these secrets.
description: This rule verifies that the AI Services Agent Orchestrator within IBM
  Watson Machine Learning pipelines has secrets isolation enabled. By enforcing secrets
  isolation, this rule ensures that sensitive credentials, keys, and other secret
  information are stored securely and are accessible only by authorized processes.
  This enhances the security of machine learning operations and aids in compliance
  with data protection regulations by providing a robust method for managing and protecting
  sensitive data within the cloud environment.
