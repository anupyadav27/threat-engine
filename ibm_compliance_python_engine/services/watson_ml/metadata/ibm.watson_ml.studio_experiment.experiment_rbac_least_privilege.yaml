title: Enforce Least Privilege in Watson ML Studio Experiment RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in Watson ML Studio experiments is
  crucial to minimizing the potential attack surface and preventing unauthorized access
  to sensitive data and resources. By ensuring that users and services have only the
  necessary permissions to perform their tasks, organizations can significantly reduce
  the risk of data breaches and maintain compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations
  for Watson ML Studio experiments to ensure compliance with the principle of least
  privilege. It verifies that users and services are assigned only the permissions
  necessary to perform their roles, thus minimizing exposure to potential security
  threats. By enforcing least privilege, organizations can improve their security
  posture, safeguard sensitive data, and meet compliance requirements such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. This practice also helps in maintaining audit trails and accountability
  by ensuring that access to critical resources is tightly controlled and monitored.
