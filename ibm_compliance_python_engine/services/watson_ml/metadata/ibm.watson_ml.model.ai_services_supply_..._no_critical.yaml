title: Ensure No Critical AI Services Supply in Watson ML Models
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Maintaining a secure AI model supply chain is crucial to prevent the introduction
  of vulnerabilities that could compromise data integrity and system functionality.
  By ensuring that no critical AI services supply issues are present, organizations
  can minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches, which can lead to
  financial losses and damage to reputation.
description: This rule checks for the presence of critical vulnerabilities in the
  AI services supply chain of Watson Machine Learning models. It ensures that all
  AI components used in the model have undergone thorough security assessments and
  are free from known critical vulnerabilities. Implementing this rule helps enhance
  the overall security posture by preventing potential attack vectors that could exploit
  weak spots in the model's supply chain, thereby aligning with compliance and governance
  standards.
