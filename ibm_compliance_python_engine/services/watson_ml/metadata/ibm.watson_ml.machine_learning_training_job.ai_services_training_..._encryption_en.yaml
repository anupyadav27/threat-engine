title: Enforce Encryption for Watson ML Training Jobs to Protect Data Privacy
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring encryption for Watson Machine Learning training jobs is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and breaches. This rule
  helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data, which is vital for complying
  with legal and regulatory standards, thereby protecting the organization's reputation
  and avoiding potential financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for Watson Machine Learning
  training jobs, ensuring that data is encrypted at rest. By enforcing this rule,
  organizations can protect sensitive information processed during machine learning
  model training from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Enabling encryption
  aligns with data protection best practices and supports compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personal and sensitive data.
