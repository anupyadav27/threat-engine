title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Watson ML Inference Endpoints
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for AI inference endpoints
  in IBM Watson Machine Learning (ML) ensures that sensitive data processed during
  inference tasks is protected against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  Encrypting inference data helps maintain customer trust, protects intellectual property,
  and adheres to regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule checks whether the AI Services Inference Endpoint in IBM Watson
  Machine Learning deployments has KMS encryption enabled. The encryption ensures
  that data at rest is secured using IBM Cloud's Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto
  Services, providing robust data protection by only allowing authorized users to
  access the decryption keys. This practice enhances security by safeguarding sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and data breaches, while also facilitating
  compliance with industry standards and legal mandates for data protection.
