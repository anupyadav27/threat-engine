title: Ensure VPC Settings Configured for Watson ML Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring VPC settings for Watson Machine Learning (ML) instances is
  essential to secure network communications and restrict unauthorized access. Proper
  VPC configuration ensures that only approved sources can communicate with the Watson
  ML service, reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining compliance with security
  standards.
description: This rule checks that Watson ML instances are configured with appropriate
  VPC settings to control network access. By enforcing VPC configurations, organizations
  can isolate their ML environments, applying network access controls that limit exposure
  to external threats. This enhances security by ensuring that only authorized traffic
  is permitted, and it supports compliance with regulatory requirements around data
  protection and privacy.
