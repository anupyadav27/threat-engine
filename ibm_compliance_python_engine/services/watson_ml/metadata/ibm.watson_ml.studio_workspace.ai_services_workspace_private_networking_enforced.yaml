title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services in Watson ML Studio
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that AI services within Watson Machine Learning Studio operate
  over private networks is crucial for minimizing exposure to public internet threats.
  By enforcing private networking, organizations can significantly reduce the risk
  of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential data exfiltration, thus maintaining
  the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive AI workloads.
description: This rule verifies that Watson Machine Learning Studio workspaces are
  configured to use private networking for AI services. By enforcing private networking,
  traffic between AI services and other cloud resources is restricted to IBM Cloud's
  secure, internal network infrastructure. This not only enhances security by limiting
  exposure to external threats but also aligns with compliance requirements for data
  protection and privacy standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring private networking
  helps organizations meet industry best practices for network access control and
  secure cloud architecture.
