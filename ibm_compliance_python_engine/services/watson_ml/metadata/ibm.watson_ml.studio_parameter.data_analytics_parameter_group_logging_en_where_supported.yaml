rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_parameter.data_analytics_parameter_group_logging_en_where_supported
title: Ensure Logging for Data Analytics Parameters in Watson ML Studio
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for data analytics parameters in Watson Machine Learning
  Studio is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive audit trail and ensuring operational
  transparency. It helps in identifying anomalies, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining
  compliance with industry regulations. This proactive approach mitigates risks associated
  with unauthorized access and data mishandling, ensuring business continuity and
  trust.
description: This rule verifies the activation of logging for data analytics parameter
  groups within Watson Machine Learning Studio where supported. By ensuring logging
  is enabled, organizations can capture detailed records of data access and parameter
  changes, which are essential for auditing and forensic analysis. This logging capability
  not only strengthens the security posture by providing visibility into operations
  but also aids in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require
  detailed audit logs for data access and processing activities.
