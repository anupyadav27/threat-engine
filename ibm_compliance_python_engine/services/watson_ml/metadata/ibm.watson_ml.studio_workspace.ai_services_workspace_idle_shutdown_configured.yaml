title: Ensure AI Services Workspace Idle Shutdown is Configured
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring idle shutdown for AI services workspaces is crucial to minimize
  unnecessary resource consumption and reduce potential attack surfaces. By automatically
  shutting down idle services, organizations can lower operational costs and mitigate
  risks associated with unattended, active sessions that could be exploited by malicious
  actors.
description: This rule checks whether the AI services workspaces within IBM Watson
  Machine Learning have the idle shutdown configuration enabled. By ensuring that
  workspaces are configured to automatically shut down after a period of inactivity,
  this rule enhances security by reducing the exposure of resources to potential threats.
  It also promotes compliance with best practices in cloud resource management and
  governance, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and remain secure.
