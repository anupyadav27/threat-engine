title: Ensure Encryption of IBM Watson Studio Notebooks at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting notebooks at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive data used
  in machine learning and analytics. Without encryption, unauthorized access could
  lead to data breaches, compromising intellectual property and violating data privacy
  regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that notebooks within IBM Watson Studio are
  encrypted at rest, ensuring that any stored data is protected against unauthorized
  access. Encryption at rest enhances data confidentiality and integrity by converting
  data into a secure format that is unreadable without a decryption key. This practice
  aligns with industry standards for data protection and aids in maintaining compliance
  with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, thus safeguarding the organization's
  reputation and customer trust.
