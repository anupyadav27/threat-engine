title: Ensure AI Endpoint Rate Limiting is Enabled for Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling rate limiting on AI endpoints is vital to prevent abuse and ensure
  fair resource allocation. Without rate limiting, excessive requests can overwhelm
  the system, leading to degraded performance or denial of service for legitimate
  users, potentially resulting in business disruption and customer dissatisfaction.
description: This rule checks if AI endpoint rate limiting is enabled for Watson Machine
  Learning deployments. Rate limiting is a network security measure that controls
  the number of requests a user can make to a service in a given timeframe. By implementing
  rate limiting, organizations can protect their AI services from excessive usage
  and potential abuse, ensuring consistent performance and availability. This practice
  supports compliance with industry best practices for network access control and
  helps maintain the integrity and reliability of AI services deployed on IBM Cloud.
