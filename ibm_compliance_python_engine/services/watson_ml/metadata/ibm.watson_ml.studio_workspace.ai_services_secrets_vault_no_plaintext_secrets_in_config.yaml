rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_workspace.ai_services_secrets_vault_no_plaintext_secrets_in_config
title: Enforce AI Services Secrets Vault Usage to Eliminate Plaintext Secrets
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that AI services secrets are stored in a secure vault and not
  in plaintext is critical for safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized
  access. Failure to protect secrets can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and
  damage to the organization's reputation. By enforcing this rule, organizations can
  maintain trust and comply with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule verifies that all AI services secrets within Watson Machine
  Learning studio workspaces are stored in a secure vault rather than in plaintext
  configuration files. By mandating the use of IBM Cloud Secrets Manager or other
  secure storage solutions, this rule enhances the security posture by preventing
  unauthorized access and potential exposure of sensitive data. Compliance with this
  rule aids in meeting regulatory requirements and aligning with best practices in
  secrets management, thereby strengthening the overall security architecture of the
  cloud environment.
