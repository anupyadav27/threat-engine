title: Ensure Network Isolation for AI Services Training Jobs in IBM Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling network isolation for machine learning training jobs in IBM Watson
  ML is crucial to safeguard sensitive data and intellectual property from unauthorized
  access and potential breaches. Network isolation ensures that training jobs operate
  in a secure, controlled environment, minimizing exposure to external threats and
  maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that network isolation is enabled for AI
  services training jobs within IBM Watson Machine Learning. By ensuring that training
  jobs are isolated from public and untrusted networks, this rule mitigates the risk
  of data exfiltration and unauthorized access. Network isolation enhances the security
  posture by restricting network access to only necessary resources, thus aligning
  with best practices for network security and regulatory compliance. This measure
  not only protects sensitive data but also supports adherence to compliance frameworks
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
