title: Ensure Encryption at Rest with Customer-Managed Keys for Data Analytics Clusters
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing encryption at rest using customer-managed keys (CMEK) within
  IBM Watson Machine Learning (WML) studio clusters is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access and potential breaches. This practice empowers
  organizations with greater control over encryption keys, ensuring compliance with
  stringent data protection regulations and enhancing trust with customers by demonstrating
  a commitment to data privacy.
description: This security rule verifies that all data stored within IBM Watson Machine
  Learning studio clusters are encrypted at rest using customer-managed keys (CMEK).
  By employing CMEK, organizations maintain full control over the encryption keys,
  allowing them to manage key rotation and revocation independently. This approach
  not only strengthens the security posture by mitigating risks of data exposure but
  also aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other industry-specific
  regulations. The rule ensures that any deviation from this standard is promptly
  identified and addressed, thereby maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of data processed within the platform.
