rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.package_artifact_signed_and_verified
title: Ensure Watson ML Model Package Artifacts Are Signed and Verified
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that package artifacts for Watson Machine Learning models are
  signed and verified is crucial for maintaining the integrity and authenticity of
  the models. Unsigned or unverified artifacts could be tampered with, leading to
  potential security breaches, data leaks, or unauthorized model execution. This practice
  helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements and protects business-critical
  AI assets.
description: This security rule checks that all package artifacts associated with
  Watson Machine Learning models are signed and the signatures are verified. By enforcing
  this rule, IBM Cloud ensures that only trusted and authentic artifacts are deployed,
  reducing the risk of malicious code execution. This process enhances the security
  posture by preventing unauthorized or altered packages from compromising the machine
  learning environment. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to industry standards
  and regulations regarding software integrity and data protection.
