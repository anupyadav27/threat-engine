rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_services_ai_endpoint_authn_required
title: Enforce Authentication for Watson ML Deployment AI Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring authentication for AI service endpoints in Watson Machine Learning
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Without proper
  authentication, malicious actors could exploit the endpoint, leading to data manipulation
  and compromising sensitive AI models, which could result in financial and reputational
  damage to the business.
description: This rule mandates that AI endpoints deployed on Watson Machine Learning
  have authentication mechanisms enabled. It checks if the deployment configurations
  require authentication for accessing AI services, thus safeguarding against unauthorized
  access. By enforcing authentication, organizations can maintain the integrity and
  confidentiality of their AI models and data. This practice aligns with network security
  best practices and helps in meeting compliance requirements by demonstrating controlled
  access to critical resources.
