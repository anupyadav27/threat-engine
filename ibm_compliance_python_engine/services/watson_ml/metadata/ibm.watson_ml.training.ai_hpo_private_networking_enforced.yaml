title: Enforce Private Networking for AI HPO in Watson ML Training
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) in
  Watson Machine Learning (ML) training environments ensures that sensitive data and
  model parameters are securely transmitted within a confined network. This reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access and data leaks, safeguarding intellectual property
  and maintaining compliance with security standards. By restricting network access
  to private channels, businesses can mitigate potential threats and maintain the
  integrity of their ML operations.
description: This rule verifies that AI HPO processes within the Watson ML training
  service are configured to use private networking. By ensuring that communications
  and data exchanges occur over a private network, the exposure to external threats
  is minimized, and the confidentiality and integrity of data are preserved. This
  practice not only enhances the overall security posture of the machine learning
  environment but also aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate stringent data protection measures. Implementing this rule helps organizations
  demonstrate their commitment to robust network security and reduces the likelihood
  of security breaches.
