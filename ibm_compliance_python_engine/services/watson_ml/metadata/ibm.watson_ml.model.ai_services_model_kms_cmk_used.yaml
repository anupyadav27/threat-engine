title: Enforce KMS CMK Usage for Watson ML Model Encryption at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that Watson Machine Learning models use a Key Management Service
  (KMS) Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption at rest is crucial for protecting
  sensitive data and intellectual property. This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and aligns with regulatory standards, bolstering client trust and safeguarding
  business continuity.
description: This security rule verifies that Watson Machine Learning models are encrypted
  using a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK). By mandating the use of a CMK, the rule ensures
  that the encryption keys are managed securely and can be rotated, disabled, or deleted
  to comply with data protection policies. This enhances the security posture by preventing
  data exposure through unauthorized decryption and supports compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require rigorous data protection measures.
