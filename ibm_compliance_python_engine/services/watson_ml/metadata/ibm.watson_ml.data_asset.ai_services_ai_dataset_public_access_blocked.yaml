title: Prevent Public Access to AI Datasets in IBM Watson ML
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to AI datasets is essential for preventing unauthorized
  exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible datasets can lead to sensitive
  data leaks, compliance violations, and reputational damage. By restricting access,
  organizations can safeguard proprietary information and maintain customer trust.
description: This rule ensures that AI datasets within the IBM Watson ML service are
  not publicly accessible, enhancing data security by enforcing strict access controls.
  It checks for configurations that allow public access to data assets and mandates
  that such settings be restricted to authorized users only. This practice not only
  bolsters security posture by minimizing the risk of unauthorized data exposure but
  also supports compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  Implementing this rule helps organizations effectively manage identities and access,
  aligning with best practices in cloud security.
