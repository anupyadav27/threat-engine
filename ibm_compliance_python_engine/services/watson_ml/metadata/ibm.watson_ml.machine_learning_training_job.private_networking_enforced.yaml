title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Training Jobs
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for machine learning training jobs is crucial
  to safeguarding sensitive data and intellectual property from unauthorized access
  and potential cyber threats. By ensuring that training jobs occur within a private
  network, organizations can maintain compliance with data protection regulations
  and reduce the risk of data breaches that could lead to significant financial and
  reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether machine learning training jobs within the Watson
  Machine Learning service are configured to use private networking. By enforcing
  private network connections, data traffic remains within a secure, controlled environment,
  reducing exposure to the public internet and mitigating risks associated with unauthorized
  access and data interception. This practice not only enhances the security posture
  of the deployment but also aids in meeting stringent compliance requirements, such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that sensitive data remains protected within the
  organization's internal network.
