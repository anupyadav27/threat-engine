title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Vector Index
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Services Vector Index is crucial to
  safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of machine learning models.
  It minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by ensuring that
  the network traffic remains within a secure, isolated environment. This approach
  supports compliance with data protection regulations and fosters customer trust
  by demonstrating a commitment to robust security practices.
description: This rule checks whether AI Services Vector Index within Watson Machine
  Learning is configured to utilize private networking, ensuring that data and service
  interactions occur over a secure, non-public network. By enforcing this configuration,
  organizations can reduce their exposure to internet-based threats and unauthorized
  access attempts. Implementing private networking for these services enhances the
  overall security posture by maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, while
  also aligning with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for network
  security and data protection.
