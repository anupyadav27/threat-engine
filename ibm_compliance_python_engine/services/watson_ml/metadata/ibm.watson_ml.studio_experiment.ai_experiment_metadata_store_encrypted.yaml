title: Ensure Encryption of AI Experiment Metadata Store in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the AI experiment metadata store is crucial for protecting sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Failure to encrypt
  data at rest can lead to significant security risks, including exposure of proprietary
  algorithms and intellectual property, which can have severe business implications
  in terms of competitive advantage and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies whether the metadata store for AI experiments within
  IBM Watson Machine Learning is encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest is a critical
  security measure that ensures data is unreadable to unauthorized users, thereby
  safeguarding sensitive information stored as part of AI experiments. By implementing
  encryption, organizations can enhance their overall security posture, meet industry
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, and protect against data breaches
  that could lead to financial and reputational damage.
