title: Enforce Private Networking for AI AutoML in Watson Machine Learning
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI AutoML models ensures that sensitive
  training data and model information are not exposed to the public internet, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This enhances the overall security
  posture of the organization by minimizing potential attack vectors and ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule ensures that AI AutoML training within the Watson Machine Learning
  (WML) service is configured to use private networking, limiting network access to
  authorized internal resources. By enforcing private networking, data in transit
  is protected from external threats, and the exposure of sensitive AI assets is minimized.
  This configuration aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring that data processing activities are conducted
  within a secure network environment.
