rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.resource.model_invocation_logs_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption of Watson ML Model Invocation Logs
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting model invocation logs in Watson ML is critical for protecting
  sensitive data and meeting compliance mandates. It ensures that the logs, which
  could contain sensitive information about model interactions, remain confidential
  and are safeguarded against unauthorized access. Failure to encrypt these logs can
  lead to data breaches, reputational damage, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for model invocation logs
  within IBM Watson Machine Learning. By enforcing encryption at rest, sensitive data
  contained in these logs is protected against unauthorized access, both malicious
  and accidental. This not only enhances the overall security posture of the Watson
  ML environment but also aids in achieving compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Organizations leveraging this encryption can ensure that
  their data management practices align with industry best practices and legal requirements.
