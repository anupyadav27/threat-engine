rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.ai_model_package_not_publicly_shared
title: Restrict Public Sharing of AI Model Packages in Watson ML
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring AI model packages are not publicly shared is critical to protecting
  intellectual property and sensitive data. Unauthorized access to AI models can lead
  to data breaches, misuse of proprietary algorithms, and potential reputational damage.
  Restricting access helps maintain data integrity and aligns with best practices
  in identity and access management.
description: This rule verifies that AI model packages within IBM Watson Machine Learning
  are not configured to allow public access. By preventing public sharing, organizations
  can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive AI models, reducing
  the risk of exposure to external threats. Implementing this rule enhances security
  posture by enforcing strict access controls, supporting compliance with data protection
  regulations, and protecting valuable AI assets from unauthorized use and potential
  exploitation.
