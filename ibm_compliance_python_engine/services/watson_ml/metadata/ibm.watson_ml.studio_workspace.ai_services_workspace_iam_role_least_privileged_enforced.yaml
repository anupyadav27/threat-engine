title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Services Workspace IAM Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for AI Services Workspace IAM roles
  ensures that users and systems have only the permissions necessary to perform their
  tasks, reducing the attack surface and minimizing potential security breaches. This
  practice is critical in safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining compliance with
  regulatory standards, which is essential for protecting organizational integrity
  and customer trust.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles associated with Watson Machine Learning
  Studio workspaces adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that roles
  are granted only the permissions required for their functions. By limiting access
  rights, this rule mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data
  leakage. Enforcing least privilege supports compliance with security frameworks
  and regulations, enhancing the overall security posture of the IBM Cloud environment
  by preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
