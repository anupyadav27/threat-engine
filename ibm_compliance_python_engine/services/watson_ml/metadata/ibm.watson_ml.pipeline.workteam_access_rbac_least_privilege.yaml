title: Enforce Least Privilege RBAC for Watson ML Pipeline Workteam Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in IBM Watson Machine Learning (ML)
  ensures that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
  This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or accidental changes to sensitive
  data and configurations, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality of
  your ML pipelines. Adhering to this principle is crucial for maintaining robust
  security and compliance posture within an organization.
description: This rule checks Watson ML pipeline configurations to ensure that role-based
  access control (RBAC) is applied according to the principle of least privilege.
  It evaluates user permissions to confirm they align with their responsibilities
  and do not exceed what is necessary for their roles. Enforcing least privilege access
  reduces the attack surface, limits potential damage from compromised accounts, and
  aids in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring that
  access to sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel only.
