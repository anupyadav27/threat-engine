title: Ensure AI Notebooks are Encrypted at Rest in IBM Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI notebooks at rest is crucial to protect sensitive machine
  learning data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that all stored data is encrypted, organizations can prevent exposure of proprietary
  algorithms and datasets, thereby maintaining trust and compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that all AI notebooks within the IBM Watson
  Machine Learning service are encrypted at rest. The rule checks for the implementation
  of encryption mechanisms for stored notebooks, ensuring that any data saved on disk
  is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, this rule enhances the overall security posture by safeguarding sensitive
  data against unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data exposure, and aiding
  in compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
