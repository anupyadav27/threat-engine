rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.endpoint_config_data_capture_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption for Watson ML Deployment Data Capture Configurations
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting endpoint configuration data captures is essential to protect
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential breaches. By ensuring
  encryption at rest, organizations can safeguard data integrity and confidentiality,
  reducing the risk of data exposure and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all data captures in Watson Machine Learning
  deployment endpoints are encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest involves the transformation
  of data into a secure format using encryption algorithms, which ensures that data
  cannot be read or altered without authorization. Implementing this encryption enhances
  security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data, complies with data
  protection regulations, and aligns with industry best practices for data privacy.
