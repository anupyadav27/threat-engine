title: Enforce Allowlist for AI Services Agent Orchestrator Tool Usage in Watson ML
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing an allowlist for AI Services Agent Orchestrator tools in the
  Watson Machine Learning (Watson ML) pipeline ensures that only pre-approved and
  secure tools are used. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized access or malicious
  activities that could compromise sensitive data or disrupt operations. By maintaining
  strict control over the tools that can interact with AI models, businesses can safeguard
  their intellectual property and maintain compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule verifies that an allowlist is strictly enforced for any tools
  used by the AI Services Agent Orchestrator within the Watson ML pipeline. By establishing
  a controlled environment where only sanctioned tools are permitted, the organization
  can prevent the execution of potentially harmful or non-compliant software. This
  practice not only enhances security by reducing the attack surface but also aligns
  with compliance mandates by ensuring that operations adhere to governance policies.
  Implementing this rule helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of AI-driven
  services and aligns with best practices for security monitoring.
