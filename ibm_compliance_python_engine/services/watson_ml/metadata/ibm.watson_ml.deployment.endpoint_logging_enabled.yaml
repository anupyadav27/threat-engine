rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.endpoint_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Endpoint Logging is Enabled for Watson ML Deployments
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling endpoint logging for Watson Machine Learning deployments is crucial
  for monitoring and auditing purposes. It provides visibility into access patterns
  and anomalies, helping to detect unauthorized access and potential misuse of deployed
  models. This practice enhances operational transparency and supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements, protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust with
  stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that endpoint logging is enabled for Watson Machine
  Learning deployments. Endpoint logging captures detailed access logs, including
  user activities and API calls, which are essential for auditing and forensic investigations.
  By ensuring logging is active, organizations can track and analyze interactions
  with their machine learning models, thereby improving security posture and aiding
  in compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing robust
  logging practices enhances threat detection capabilities and supports incident response
  efforts.
