title: Ensure AI Experiment Logs are Enabled in IBM Watson ML Studio
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling AI experiment logs in IBM Watson Machine Learning Studio is crucial
  for maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of machine learning activities. This
  practice enhances the ability to detect anomalies, investigate security incidents,
  and ensure accountability for changes made during AI experiments. Failing to enable
  logging can lead to gaps in monitoring, making it challenging to comply with regulatory
  requirements and potentially resulting in financial or reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for AI experiments conducted
  within IBM Watson Machine Learning Studio. By ensuring that logs are collected,
  organizations can track actions and changes made during the lifecycle of AI experiments,
  contributing to improved security posture through enhanced visibility and traceability.
  Additionally, enabling logs supports compliance with industry standards and regulations
  that require audit logging as a core component of security and risk management practices.
  Logs provide valuable insights for forensic analysis, help identify potential security
  breaches, and facilitate the continuous improvement of security measures.
