title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML AutoML Training
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Watson Machine Learning (ML) AutoML training
  ensures that sensitive data remains within a secure boundary, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access and data breaches. By isolating training workloads from the
  public internet, organizations can enhance data privacy and meet stringent compliance
  requirements, ultimately protecting their business reputation and customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that Watson ML AutoML training activities
  are conducted within a private network, ensuring that all data exchanges occur over
  secure, internal communication channels. By enforcing private networking, the rule
  mitigates risks associated with data exposure to external threats, thereby enhancing
  the overall security posture of the machine learning environment. Compliance with
  this rule not only aligns with best practices in network access control but also
  supports adherence to regulatory frameworks requiring data protection and privacy.
