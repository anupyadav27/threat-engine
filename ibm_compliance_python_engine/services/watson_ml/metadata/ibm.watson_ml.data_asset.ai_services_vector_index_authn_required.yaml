rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.data_asset.ai_services_vector_index_authn_required
title: Enforce Authentication for AI Services Vector Index in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that authentication is required for accessing AI Services Vector
  Indexes in Watson Machine Learning (Watson ML) is crucial for safeguarding sensitive
  data assets. Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, compromising personal
  or proprietary information, and potentially resulting in financial and reputational
  damage to the business.
description: This security rule mandates authentication for accessing AI Services
  Vector Indexes within Watson ML data assets, ensuring that only authorized users
  can interact with sensitive data. By enforcing authentication, the rule mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
  This practice aligns with industry standards for data protection and compliance,
  supporting organizations in meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA
  by ensuring data is encrypted at rest and accessed only by authenticated entities.
