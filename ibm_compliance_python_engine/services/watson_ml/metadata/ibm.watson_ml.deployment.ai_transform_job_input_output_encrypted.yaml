rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_transform_job_input_output_encrypted
title: Ensure AI Transform Job Data in Watson ML is Encrypted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting input and output data for AI transform jobs in IBM Watson Machine
  Learning (ML) is crucial to safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This practice not only enhances data confidentiality
  and integrity but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  which can protect the organization's reputation and avoid legal penalties.
description: This rule verifies that all input and output data associated with AI
  transform jobs within IBM Watson ML deployments are encrypted at rest. Encryption
  at rest involves securing data stored on disk and other storage devices, ensuring
  that even if unauthorized access is achieved, the data remains unreadable without
  proper decryption keys. Implementing robust encryption mechanisms aligns with best
  practices for data protection, helping organizations meet compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data privacy regulations.
