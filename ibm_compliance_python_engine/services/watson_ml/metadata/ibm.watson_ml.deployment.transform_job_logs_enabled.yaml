rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.transform_job_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Transform Job Logs Are Enabled for Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling transform job logs in IBM Watson Machine Learning (ML) deployments
  is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of operations. This logging
  practice aids in troubleshooting, enhances transparency, and supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements by providing insights into model behavior and data
  transformations, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized or anomalous activities.
description: This rule verifies that logging for transform jobs is enabled within
  Watson ML deployments. By ensuring that logs are maintained, organizations can monitor
  the execution of transformations, detect irregularities, and conduct thorough post-event
  analyses. This not only fortifies the security posture but also aligns with compliance
  standards, facilitating audits and ensuring accountability by maintaining detailed
  records of data processing activities.
