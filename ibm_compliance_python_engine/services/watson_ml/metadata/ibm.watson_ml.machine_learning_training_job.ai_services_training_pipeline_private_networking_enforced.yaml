title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Training Pipelines
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI services training pipelines is crucial
  to safeguard sensitive data and intellectual property involved in machine learning
  models. By limiting network access to private networks, organizations can minimize
  exposure to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thereby maintaining
  compliance with data protection regulations and preserving business reputation.
description: This rule ensures that machine learning training jobs within IBM Watson
  Machine Learning enforce private networking configurations. It verifies that training
  pipelines are restricted to communicate over private endpoints, thereby preventing
  exposure to public networks. This setup enhances security by reducing the attack
  surface and ensuring only authorized internal systems can access the data during
  training. Implementing this rule not only fulfills compliance with best practices
  for network security but also aligns with data protection standards, thereby mitigating
  risks associated with data leakage and unauthorized access.
