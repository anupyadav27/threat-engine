title: Ensure KMS Encryption and Rotation for AI Services Secrets Vault
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that AI Services Secrets Vaults are encrypted using a Key Management
  Service (KMS) with regular key rotation is critical for safeguarding sensitive data.
  This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and ensures compliance with
  data protection standards, thereby protecting the organization's intellectual property
  and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that any AI Services Secrets Vault associated with
  Watson Machine Learning studio workspaces is encrypted using IBM Key Protect or
  Hyper Protect Crypto Services. It checks that key rotation policies are actively
  enforced to ensure keys are not used beyond their intended lifespan, thereby reducing
  the risk of key compromise. Implementing KMS encryption and key rotation enhances
  data protection by ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read
  without the proper keys. This practice aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, offering businesses a robust security posture.
