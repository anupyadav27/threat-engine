title: Ensuring Authorization Policies in Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing authorization policies within Watson Machine Learning (ML) deployments
  is crucial for maintaining a secure environment. Without proper authorization controls,
  sensitive data and model integrity can be compromised, leading to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches that can have significant financial and reputational
  impacts on the organization.
description: This rule checks the enforcement of authorization policies within Watson
  ML deployments to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users have access
  to deploy and manage ML models. By verifying these policies, organizations can mitigate
  unauthorized access risks and maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.
  Implementing robust authorization controls helps in preserving data confidentiality
  and integrity, while also supporting audit and compliance efforts by providing detailed
  access logs and reports.
