title: Enforce Least Privilege for Watson ML HPO Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Hyperparameter Optimization
  (HPO) roles in IBM Watson Machine Learning is crucial to minimizing potential security
  risks. Excessive permissions increase the attack surface and can lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive resources, potentially resulting in data breaches and compliance
  violations. Ensuring that roles have only the permissions necessary to perform their
  tasks helps protect critical assets and maintain regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks whether HPO roles in IBM Watson Machine Learning are
  configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that roles
  have only the permissions required to perform specific training tasks, thus reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and inadvertent data exposure. By enforcing this
  rule, organizations can enhance their security posture, protect sensitive data,
  and comply with industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular
  audits and adjustments to role permissions according to evolving business needs
  are essential to maintaining an optimal security configuration.
