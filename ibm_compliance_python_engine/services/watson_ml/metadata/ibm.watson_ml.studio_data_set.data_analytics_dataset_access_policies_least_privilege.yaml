title: Enforce Least Privilege on Watson ML Studio Data Set Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access policies for Watson ML Studio data
  sets is crucial for minimizing security risks by ensuring that users and services
  only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This approach reduces
  the attack surface, mitigates potential data breaches, and helps protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access. Maintaining stringent access controls is vital for
  compliance with regulatory standards and safeguarding business integrity.
description: This rule ensures that access policies for Watson ML Studio data sets
  adhere to the principle of least privilege, meaning users and services are granted
  only the permissions essential for their roles. Regularly reviewing and adjusting
  these permissions not only enhances security by preventing unauthorized access but
  also aligns with compliance frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA. By automating the
  monitoring of access policies, organizations can quickly identify and rectify deviations,
  thereby maintaining a robust security posture and reducing the likelihood of data
  exposure.
