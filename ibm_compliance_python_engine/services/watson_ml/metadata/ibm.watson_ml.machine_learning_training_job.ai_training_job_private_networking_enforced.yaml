title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Training Jobs in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that AI training jobs in Watson Machine Learning are restricted
  to private networks is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and intellectual
  property. By minimizing exposure to public networks, you significantly reduce the
  risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, which can have severe financial
  and reputational repercussions for businesses.
description: This rule checks whether AI training jobs in IBM Watson Machine Learning
  are configured to use private networking exclusively. By enforcing private networking,
  data transmitted during training processes is kept within a secure, controlled environment,
  thereby enhancing data confidentiality and integrity. Moreover, this approach aligns
  with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for data protection, helping
  organizations meet compliance standards while maintaining robust network security.
