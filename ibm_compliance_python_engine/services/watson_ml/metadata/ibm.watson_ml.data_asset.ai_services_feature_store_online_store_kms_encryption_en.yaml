title: Enforce KMS Encryption for AI Feature Store Online Data in Watson ML
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for the AI Services
  Feature Store Online Store is critical to protecting sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and breaches. Encryption at rest ensures that data stored within IBM Watson
  Machine Learning is securely encrypted, reducing the risk of data leaks and enhancing
  trust in the platform. Proper encryption safeguards intellectual property and complies
  with stringent data protection and privacy regulations.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Watson Machine Learning's Feature Store Online
  Store uses Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for data assets. By employing
  KMS encryption, data is secured with customer-managed keys, providing an additional
  layer of security and control over cryptographic operations. This practice not only
  strengthens the security posture by protecting data at rest but also aligns with
  industry best practices and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and CCPA, thereby
  facilitating compliance efforts.
