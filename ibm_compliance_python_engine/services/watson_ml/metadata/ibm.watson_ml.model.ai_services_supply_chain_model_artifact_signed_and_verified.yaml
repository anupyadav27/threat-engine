title: Ensure AI Service Model Artifacts are Signed and Verified
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Signing and verifying AI model artifacts is crucial in maintaining the
  integrity and authenticity of models deployed on IBM Cloud. This process helps prevent
  the deployment of tampered or malicious models that could compromise data integrity,
  lead to incorrect analytics results, and ultimately damage business reputations.
  Ensuring artifacts are signed and verified mitigates risks associated with unauthorized
  modifications and enhances trust in AI-driven decisions.
description: This rule ensures that all AI model artifacts within the Watson Machine
  Learning service are signed and verified. It checks for digital signatures on model
  artifacts, ensuring they originate from a trusted source and have not been altered.
  By implementing this control, organizations can enhance their security posture by
  preventing the execution of untrusted code and maintaining compliance with industry
  standards for software supply chain security. This practice supports a robust governance
  framework and helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by providing an audit
  trail and assurance of model provenance.
