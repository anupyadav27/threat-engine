title: Enforce Least Privilege for Human Review Workteam in Watson ML Pipelines
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Human Review Workteams
  in Watson Machine Learning pipelines is crucial to minimizing security risks and
  potential data breaches. By restricting access to only the necessary resources required
  for team members to perform their roles, organizations can prevent unauthorized
  data access and maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule ensures that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is properly configured
  to grant Human Review Workteam members the minimum permissions necessary within
  Watson ML pipelines. The system verifies that users have restricted access, aligning
  with the least privilege principle, which significantly mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access and data exposure. By enforcing this control, organizations enhance their
  security posture, reduce the attack surface, and align with compliance frameworks
  that mandate stringent access controls.
