title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Deployment Endpoints
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Watson ML deployment endpoints is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data and models from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By restricting endpoint access to private networks, organizations
  can significantly reduce the attack surface, ensuring that only trusted internal
  systems can communicate with the deployment, which helps maintain the integrity
  and confidentiality of business-critical AI solutions.
description: This security rule checks whether Watson ML deployment endpoints are
  configured to enforce private networking, thereby restricting access to internal
  networks only. By implementing this configuration, organizations enhance their security
  posture by preventing exposure to the public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data leaks. This practice aligns with network access control
  policies and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring data privacy
  and protection. Additionally, it supports secure collaboration among teams by maintaining
  a controlled and monitored network environment.
