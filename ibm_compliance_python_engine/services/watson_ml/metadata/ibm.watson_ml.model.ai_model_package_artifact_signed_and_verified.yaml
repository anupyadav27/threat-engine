rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.ai_model_package_artifact_signed_and_verified
title: Ensure AI Model Package Artifacts are Signed and Verified
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that AI model package artifacts are signed and verified is crucial
  to maintaining the integrity and authenticity of AI models deployed on the IBM Cloud.
  This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized or malicious code being executed
  within a Watson Machine Learning environment, protecting sensitive data and maintaining
  trust with stakeholders and customers.
description: This rule checks whether AI model package artifacts in Watson Machine
  Learning are appropriately signed and verified. By enforcing artifact signing and
  verification, organizations can ensure that only validated and authorized models
  are executed, thereby reducing the risk of deploying compromised or tampered models.
  This process enhances overall security by ensuring compliance with best practices
  and regulatory requirements related to software integrity and provenance, ultimately
  supporting governance and control over AI deployments.
