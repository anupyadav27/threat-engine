title: Ensure Encryption of Input/Output for AI Training Jobs in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting input and output data for AI training jobs is crucial to protect
  sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Implementing
  encryption safeguards data integrity and confidentiality, aligning with regulatory
  compliance requirements and enhancing trust with clients by ensuring their data
  is securely handled.
description: This rule verifies that all input and output data associated with Watson
  Machine Learning (Watson ML) training jobs are encrypted. By ensuring encryption
  at rest, the rule helps protect against unauthorized data access and potential data
  breaches. This measure bolsters data protection strategies, ensuring compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, and reduces the risk of data exposure
  during the machine learning lifecycle. Enforcing encryption strengthens the overall
  security posture by maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.
