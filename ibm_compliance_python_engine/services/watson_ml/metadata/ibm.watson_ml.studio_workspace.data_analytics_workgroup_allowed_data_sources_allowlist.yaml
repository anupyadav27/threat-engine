title: Control Data Sources for Watson ML Studio Workspaces
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that only approved data sources are accessible by Watson ML Studio
  workspaces is crucial for maintaining data security and compliance with data protection
  regulations. By restricting access to a predefined list of data sources, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized data exposure and mitigate the risk of data breaches, thereby
  protecting sensitive information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that Watson ML Studio workspaces are configured
  to allow access only to data sources specified in an approved allowlist. By enforcing
  this configuration, organizations can ensure that data analytics activities only
  interact with trusted data repositories. This control helps to safeguard data integrity
  and confidentiality by reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized data
  exfiltration. Compliance with data protection standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  is supported by demonstrating controlled data access and enhanced data governance.
