title: Ensure Encryption of AI Services Training Job Outputs in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for AI services training job outputs is crucial for
  safeguarding sensitive data processed and generated during machine learning activities.
  This practice mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, ensuring
  compliance with industry standards and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. By protecting
  data at rest, organizations maintain trust and avoid potential financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for the outputs of machine
  learning training jobs conducted using IBM Watson Machine Learning services. Enabling
  encryption at rest ensures that all data generated during the training process is
  securely stored, thereby enhancing data protection and privacy. This measure not
  only aligns with industry best practices but also aids in adhering to regulatory
  requirements for data security and privacy, offering a robust defense against data
  leaks and unauthorized access.
