rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for Watson ML Deployments
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for Watson Machine Learning (ML) deployments is crucial
  for maintaining an audit trail of activities and changes. This practice not only
  aids in detecting unauthorized access and troubleshooting issues but also helps
  in fulfilling compliance requirements by providing visibility into the operations
  and security of deployed models.
description: This security rule checks whether logging is enabled for Watson ML deployments,
  ensuring that all interactions and activities are recorded. By enabling logging,
  organizations can monitor access patterns, track changes, and identify potential
  security incidents in real time. This proactive approach to logging supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations by providing a robust audit trail, which
  is essential for forensic analysis and operational transparency.
