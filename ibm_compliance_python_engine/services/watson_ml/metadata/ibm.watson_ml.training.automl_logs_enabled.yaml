rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.training.automl_logs_enabled
title: Ensure AutoML Logs are Enabled for Watson Machine Learning Training
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling AutoML logs for Watson Machine Learning training sessions is crucial
  for maintaining transparency and accountability in the machine learning lifecycle.
  It provides valuable insights into model training activities, facilitating the detection
  of anomalies or unauthorized access. Capturing these logs ensures compliance with
  industry standards and helps in forensic investigations and auditing processes.
description: This rule verifies that logging for AutoML training activities in Watson
  Machine Learning is enabled. By capturing detailed logs, organizations can monitor
  and audit the activities within their machine learning environments, ensuring adherence
  to compliance requirements and strengthening their security posture. Enabling logging
  helps in tracking operational metrics, understanding system behavior, and identifying
  potential security incidents, thereby enhancing the overall security and reliability
  of the machine learning processes.
