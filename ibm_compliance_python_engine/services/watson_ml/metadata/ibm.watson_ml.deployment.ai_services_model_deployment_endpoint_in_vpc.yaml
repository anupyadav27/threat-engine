title: Ensure AI Model Deployment Endpoints Reside Within a VPC
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring AI Services Model Deployment Endpoints are within a Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC) is crucial for maintaining network isolation and security. This configuration
  minimizes exposure to public internet threats, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, thus safeguarding sensitive AI model data and
  computational resources.
description: This rule checks that AI model deployment endpoints in IBM Watson Machine
  Learning are configured within a VPC. Deploying these endpoints within a VPC ensures
  that they benefit from the network isolation and security controls provided by VPCs,
  such as security groups and access control lists (ACLs). This setup not only enhances
  the security posture by restricting access to trusted network segments but also
  aids in compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate controlled
  access to critical resources.
