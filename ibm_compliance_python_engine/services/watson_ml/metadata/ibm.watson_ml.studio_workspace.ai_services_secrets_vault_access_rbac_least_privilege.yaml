title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Services Vault Access in Watson ML
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for AI services secrets vault access is crucial
  to minimize the risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches.
  By restricting access, organizations can ensure that only authorized users can interact
  with sensitive AI service configurations, reducing the attack surface and maintaining
  compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that access to the AI services secrets vault within
  the Watson Machine Learning studio workspace is configured according to the principle
  of least privilege. It ensures that RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies are
  in place to restrict access to only those users and roles that require it for their
  specific job functions. By enforcing strict RBAC policies, organizations can prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive information, thereby enhancing the security posture
  of their AI services and maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations.
