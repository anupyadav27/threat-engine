rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for Watson Machine Learning Pipelines
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for Watson Machine Learning pipelines is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into the operations and transformations occurring within your machine
  learning workflows. It allows for effective monitoring and forensic analysis, which
  can be critical in identifying and responding to security incidents or operational
  anomalies. Without logging, organizations may struggle to meet compliance mandates
  and could face increased risk of data breaches or operational failures.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for Watson Machine Learning
  pipelines to ensure that all activities and transformations within the pipeline
  are recorded. By enabling logging, organizations can track data flow, detect unauthorized
  access, and pinpoint performance issues. This practice not only enhances the security
  posture by providing an audit trail but also supports compliance with regulatory
  standards that require detailed activity logs. Enabling logging aligns with best
  practices in security posture management, facilitating incident response, and continuous
  monitoring of machine learning activities.
