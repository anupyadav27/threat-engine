rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_notebook.ai_notebook_no_public_access
title: Restrict Public Access to Watson ML Studio Notebooks
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that AI notebooks within the IBM Watson Machine Learning service
  do not have public access is crucial to protect sensitive data and intellectual
  property. Public exposure can lead to unauthorized data manipulation, theft, and
  potential breaches that could severely impact business operations and reputation.
description: This rule checks for any Watson Machine Learning Studio notebooks that
  are accessible to the public without restrictions. By enforcing private access,
  it strengthens the security posture by mitigating risks associated with unauthorized
  access and data breaches. This practice not only aligns with industry best practices
  for data security but also supports compliance with various regulatory standards
  by ensuring that sensitive data remains confined within trusted environments.
