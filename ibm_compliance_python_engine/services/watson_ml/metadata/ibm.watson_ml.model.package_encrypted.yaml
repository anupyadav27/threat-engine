rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.package_encrypted
title: Ensure Model Package Encryption in IBM Watson Machine Learning
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting model packages in Watson Machine Learning is crucial to protect
  sensitive data and intellectual property from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. Encryption at rest mitigates risks associated with data exposure, ensuring
  compliance with industry standards and regulations, and safeguarding business assets
  against financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all model packages within IBM Watson Machine
  Learning are encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption, the rule ensures data confidentiality
  and integrity, preventing unauthorized access and modifications. This practice is
  aligned with data protection and privacy regulations, offering a robust security
  posture and enhancing trust with clients by demonstrating adherence to stringent
  security standards. It also aids in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of personal and sensitive information.
