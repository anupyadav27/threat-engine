title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Watson ML Training Jobs
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for IBM Watson Machine Learning training jobs is crucial
  for maintaining transparency and accountability within an organization's data operations.
  Logs provide a detailed record of activities, which can be vital for troubleshooting
  issues and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Without proper logging,
  it may be challenging to audit actions and diagnose anomalies, potentially leading
  to data breaches or non-compliance fines.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for machine learning training
  jobs within the IBM Watson ML service. Ensuring logs are active allows organizations
  to capture detailed event data, which can be used to monitor operations, detect
  unauthorized access, and maintain data integrity. This practice not only fortifies
  security by allowing for early detection of suspicious activities but also aids
  in compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate audit logging
  as part of a comprehensive security posture. Compliance with this rule helps in
  maintaining operational transparency and facilitates the quick resolution of issues
  through enhanced visibility.
