title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Watson ML AI Services Pipelines
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling KMS encryption for AI services pipelines in Watson Machine Learning
  is critical for safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring that it is protected both
  in transit and at rest. This measure helps prevent unauthorized access and data
  breaches, aligning with data protection regulations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that Key Management Service (KMS) encryption is enabled
  for AI services pipelines within Watson Machine Learning. By enforcing encryption
  at rest, it ensures that all data processed and stored by the pipelines is secure,
  leveraging IBM's robust encryption standards. This practice not only enhances the
  security posture of your AI deployments but also aids in achieving compliance with
  regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection
  measures.
