rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.artifacts_private_and_encrypted
title: Ensure Watson ML Pipeline Artifacts are Private and Encrypted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting and privatizing pipeline artifacts in Watson Machine Learning
  (ML) is crucial to safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. This practice not only protects the integrity and confidentiality of the
  data but also ensures compliance with regulatory standards, thereby minimizing legal
  risks and enhancing customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all artifacts associated with Watson ML pipelines
  are stored in a manner that ensures they are both private and encrypted at rest.
  By implementing encryption, data is converted into a secure format that is unreadable
  without the appropriate decryption key, thus preventing unauthorized access. Additionally,
  ensuring artifacts are private further restricts access to only authorized users.
  Compliance with this rule supports adherence to data protection regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, reducing the risk of data breaches and potential financial penalties.
