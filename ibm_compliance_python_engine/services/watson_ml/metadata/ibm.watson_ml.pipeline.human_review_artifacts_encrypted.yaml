title: Encryption of Human Review Artifacts in Watson ML Pipelines
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting human review artifacts in Watson Machine Learning pipelines
  is vital to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Ensuring encryption at rest mitigates risks associated with data theft or exposure,
  thereby safeguarding intellectual property and maintaining customer trust. Furthermore,
  it aligns with regulatory requirements for data protection, reducing potential legal
  and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that all human review artifacts within Watson Machine
  Learning pipelines are encrypted at rest. It ensures the use of robust encryption
  algorithms to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality, thereby preventing unauthorized
  access. By enforcing encryption, this rule enhances the security posture of the
  pipeline, helping organizations comply with data protection regulations such as
  GDPR and HIPAA. This measure not only protects sensitive information but also fortifies
  the overall security framework of the IBM Cloud environment.
