rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.ai_services_pipeline_logging_enabled
title: Ensure AI Services Pipeline Logging is Enabled in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for AI services pipelines in IBM Watson Machine Learning
  is crucial for maintaining a secure environment. Logging provides visibility into
  pipeline activities, helping detect anomalies or unauthorized access. This not only
  secures sensitive data but also supports compliance with industry regulations and
  internal governance policies, mitigating potential risks and safeguarding business
  continuity.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for AI services pipelines
  within IBM Watson Machine Learning. By ensuring logging is active, organizations
  can track and monitor pipeline activities, which aids in identifying suspicious
  behavior and unauthorized access attempts. Logging also facilitates robust auditing
  processes, ensuring that all operations are documented and traceable, thereby enhancing
  the overall security posture and compliance with regulatory standards like GDPR
  and HIPAA. This proactive measure is part of a broader strategy to maintain an effective
  security and compliance framework within the IBM Cloud environment.
