title: Ensure AI Model Image Scans Pass in IBM Watson Machine Learning
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that AI model images are scanned and pass security checks is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of machine learning
  models. Unverified images can introduce vulnerabilities that may be exploited by
  malicious actors, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. A
  robust image scanning process helps maintain trust and compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This rule verifies that AI model images used in IBM Watson Machine Learning
  have been successfully scanned and passed security checks. The image scanning process
  identifies vulnerabilities, malware, and configuration issues that could compromise
  the containerized environment. By ensuring that only secure images are deployed,
  this practice not only enhances the security posture of the cloud environment but
  also aids in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing
  this rule helps in maintaining a secure, reliable, and compliant AI service infrastructure.
