title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Services Data Pipeline in Watson ML
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access controls for AI services data pipelines
  is crucial to minimize security risks by ensuring that users and services have only
  the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the potential for
  accidental or malicious data exposure and aligns with compliance requirements for
  data protection, safeguarding sensitive information within the Watson ML service.
description: This rule verifies that access controls for Watson ML pipelines adhere
  to the principle of least privilege. By limiting permissions to the minimum necessary
  for users and services, it mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
  Implementing least privilege access controls enhances security posture by reducing
  the attack surface and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent access management practices.
