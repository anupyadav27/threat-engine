title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Deployment Transform Jobs
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Watson Machine Learning (ML) deployment
  transform jobs is crucial to safeguard sensitive data and models from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This measure ensures that data transfers during
  job execution occur within a secure, isolated network environment, minimizing exposure
  to external threats. By mandating private networking, organizations can maintain
  data integrity and comply with stringent industry regulations, thereby preserving
  their reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all Watson ML deployment transform jobs are configured
  to use private networking, restricting data transmission to secure, internal IBM
  Cloud networks. By ensuring that transform jobs operate within a private network,
  this rule mitigates risks associated with data leakage and unauthorized network
  access. Implementing private networking enhances overall security posture by reducing
  attack surfaces and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate data protection and privacy.
