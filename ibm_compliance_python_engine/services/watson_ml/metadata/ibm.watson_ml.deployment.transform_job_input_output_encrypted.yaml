rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.transform_job_input_output_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Watson ML Transform Job Inputs and Outputs
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the input and output data of Watson Machine Learning transform
  jobs is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, particularly
  when handling sensitive or proprietary information. Without encryption, data could
  be vulnerable to unauthorized access and breaches, potentially leading to compliance
  violations and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all inputs and outputs of transform jobs in Watson
  Machine Learning deployments are encrypted at rest. This security measure ensures
  that data is protected from unauthorized access, both during processing and when
  stored. Implementing encryption aligns with industry best practices and regulatory
  requirements, thereby enhancing data protection and privacy. Adhering to this rule
  helps organizations to mitigate risks associated with data breaches and ensures
  compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
