title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Data Analytics Clusters
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Watson Machine Learning Data Analytics Clusters operate within
  a private network is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining regulatory
  compliance. By restricting network access, organizations can mitigate the risk of
  unauthorized data exposure and potential breaches, thereby protecting intellectual
  property and customer data integrity.
description: This rule verifies that Watson Machine Learning Studio Clusters are configured
  to use private networks, preventing public access and unauthorized connections.
  By enforcing private networking, it ensures that data analytics processes and communications
  occur within a more secure, isolated environment. This configuration enhances network
  security by limiting vulnerabilities to external threats and aligns with compliance
  requirements for data protection and privacy standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
