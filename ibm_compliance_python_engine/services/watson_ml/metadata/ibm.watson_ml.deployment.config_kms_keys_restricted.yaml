rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.config_kms_keys_restricted
title: Restrict IBM Watson ML Deployments to Configured KMS Keys Only
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing the use of restricted Key Management Service (KMS) keys for IBM
  Watson Machine Learning deployments ensures that only authorized keys are used,
  thereby safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access. This measure is crucial
  for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and aiding compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This security rule assesses IBM Watson Machine Learning deployments to
  ensure that they are configured to utilize only specified Key Management Service
  (KMS) keys for encryption at rest. By restricting deployments to predetermined KMS
  keys, organizations can enforce usage policies and maintain tight control over data
  encryption processes. This practice not only enhances security by preventing unauthorized
  access to data but also helps in meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA by ensuring that all data encryption adheres to best practice standards.
