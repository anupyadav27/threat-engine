title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI HPO Roles in Watson ML Training
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Adhering to the principle of least privilege for AI Hyperparameter Optimization
  (HPO) roles in Watson Machine Learning (ML) is crucial for minimizing security risks
  and potential exposure of sensitive data. By ensuring that roles and access permissions
  are limited to only what is necessary, organizations can significantly reduce the
  attack surface and prevent unauthorized access to critical training resources, thereby
  protecting intellectual property and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This security rule verifies that AI HPO roles within the Watson Machine
  Learning training environment are configured to adhere to the least privilege principle.
  It checks that each role has only the necessary permissions required to perform
  its intended functions without granting excessive access that could lead to data
  leakage or unauthorized operations. Implementing this rule enhances security by
  reducing the risk of privilege escalation and helps organizations comply with industry
  standards and regulations, thereby safeguarding business operations and sensitive
  information.
