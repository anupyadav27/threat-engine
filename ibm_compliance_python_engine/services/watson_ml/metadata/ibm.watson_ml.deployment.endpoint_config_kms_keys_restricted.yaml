rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.endpoint_config_kms_keys_restricted
title: Enforce KMS Key Restrictions for Watson ML Endpoint Configurations
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting the use of Key Management Service (KMS) keys in Watson Machine
  Learning (ML) endpoint configurations is crucial for protecting sensitive data during
  processing. By enforcing this rule, organizations mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches, ensuring that only authorized keys are used
  for encryption. This enhances compliance with data protection regulations and maintains
  customer trust.
description: This rule checks that all Watson ML endpoint configurations utilize KMS
  keys that are restricted to authorized personnel and systems. By ensuring that endpoint
  configurations do not utilize unrestricted keys, this rule helps to enforce stringent
  access controls and encryption standards. Implementing KMS key restrictions enhances
  data security by ensuring that only approved cryptographic keys are used to encrypt
  data at rest, aligning with industry best practices for data protection and privacy
  compliance.
