title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Watson AI Model Versions
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for AI model versions
  in IBM Watson Machine Learning is crucial for protecting sensitive data. Encryption
  at rest safeguards data from unauthorized access and potential breaches, ensuring
  compliance with industry standards and regulations. Failure to implement this protection
  can lead to data exposure, legal penalties, and loss of client trust.
description: This security rule verifies that all AI model versions within IBM Watson
  Machine Learning are encrypted using IBM's Key Management Service (KMS). The rule
  checks for the presence of KMS encryption keys associated with the model versions,
  ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted at rest. Implementing KMS encryption enhances
  the security posture by allowing organizations to manage encryption keys securely
  and meet compliance requirements for data protection and privacy. This helps prevent
  unauthorized data access and aligns with best practices for safeguarding intellectual
  property and customer data.
