title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of AI Models in IBM Watson ML
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of AI models in IBM Watson Machine Learning
  is crucial to maintaining data privacy and integrity. Uncontrolled sharing can lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential intellectual property theft,
  impacting both business reputation and compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule ensures that AI models stored in the IBM Watson Machine Learning
  Model Registry are not shared across different accounts unless explicitly authorized.
  By enforcing this restriction, security is enhanced by limiting potential exposure
  to unauthorized parties. The practice supports compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring that sensitive data and models remain within
  the intended organizational boundaries, thereby reducing risk of data leakage and
  maintaining data sovereignty.
