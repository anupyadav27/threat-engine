rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.registry_rbac_least_privilege
title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for IBM Watson ML Model Registry
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the principle of least privilege in Watson ML's model registry
  ensures that users have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing
  the risk of unauthorized access or malicious actions. This approach reduces the
  attack surface and potential data breaches, safeguarding intellectual property and
  maintaining trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule checks for role-based access control (RBAC) configurations
  within the IBM Watson ML model registry to ensure that users are granted the minimum
  permissions required for their roles. By validating the adherence to least privilege,
  this rule helps limit access to sensitive machine learning models, thereby protecting
  them from unauthorized modifications or exposure. Ensuring proper RBAC implementation
  not only enhances security but also aids in compliance with data protection standards
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent access controls.
