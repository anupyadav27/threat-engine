title: Ensure KMS Encryption for Watson ML Model Deployments
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for Watson Machine Learning
  (ML) model deployments is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining
  privacy. Without encryption, models and associated data are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access, potentially leading to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection
  regulations. Implementing KMS encryption ensures that models are secured with robust
  cryptographic standards, aligning with best practices for data protection.
description: This rule verifies that all AI services model deployments in Watson ML
  have KMS encryption enabled, ensuring that data at rest is encrypted using customer-controlled
  keys. By enforcing this encryption, the integrity and confidentiality of machine
  learning models and their data are preserved, reducing the risk of data exposure.
  This practice not only strengthens the security posture but also aids in meeting
  regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection
  measures.
