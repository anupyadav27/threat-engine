title: Ensure AI Training Job Logs are Enabled for Watson Machine Learning
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logs for AI training jobs is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into the operations of machine learning models. This not only helps in identifying
  and troubleshooting issues but also plays a vital role in compliance with data protection
  regulations by providing an audit trail of activities. Without logging, organizations
  risk missing critical insights into model performance and potential security vulnerabilities.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Watson Machine Learning
  training jobs, ensuring that all actions and events related to AI model training
  are recorded. By enabling logs, organizations can monitor for anomalies, perform
  forensic analysis in the event of a security incident, and maintain compliance with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements. Logging enhances security posture
  by providing detailed records of system interactions and user activities, which
  are essential for auditing and threat detection.
