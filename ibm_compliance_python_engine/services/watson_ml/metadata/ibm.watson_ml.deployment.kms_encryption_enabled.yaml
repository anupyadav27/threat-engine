rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.kms_encryption_enabled
title: Enforce KMS Encryption for Watson ML Deployments
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for Watson Machine Learning
  (ML) deployments is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. This rule ensures that
  data at rest is protected against unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. By utilizing
  KMS, organizations can maintain control over encryption keys, enhancing data security
  and trust from clients.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for all Watson ML deployments.
  It checks the encryption status of deployment data, ensuring that the data is secured
  using keys managed by IBM's Key Management Service. By enforcing KMS encryption,
  the rule strengthens data protection by encrypting data at rest, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized data exposure. This practice aligns with industry standards and
  compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, enhancing the organization's security
  posture and regulatory compliance.
