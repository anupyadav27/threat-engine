rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_services_prompt_gateway_token_scopes_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Services Prompt Gateway Tokens
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that AI Services Prompt Gateway tokens are configured with the
  least privilege principle is critical to minimizing access to only necessary resources,
  thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This
  approach not only protects sensitive data and intellectual property but also aligns
  with industry best practices for cybersecurity, enhancing the overall security posture
  and compliance of the organization.
description: This security rule verifies that AI Services Prompt Gateway tokens for
  Watson Machine Learning deployments are assigned only the necessary scopes required
  for their specific functions. By restricting token scopes to the least privilege,
  the rule mitigates the risk of excessive permissions that could be exploited by
  malicious actors. Implementing this rule helps maintain robust access controls,
  ensuring compliance with security standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and GDPR by safeguarding
  personal and sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential misuse.
