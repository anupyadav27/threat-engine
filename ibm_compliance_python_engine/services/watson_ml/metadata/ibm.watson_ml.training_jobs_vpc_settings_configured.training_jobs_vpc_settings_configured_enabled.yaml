title: Ensure Watson ML Training Jobs VPC Settings Are Configured
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring VPC settings for Watson Machine Learning (ML) training jobs
  is crucial to ensuring secure and controlled network access. By isolating training
  jobs within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), organizations can prevent unauthorized
  access and mitigate risks associated with data breaches or network exposure, ultimately
  protecting sensitive data and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) settings are configured
  for Watson ML training jobs. By enforcing VPC settings, organizations can enhance
  security by controlling network access and isolating resources from public internet
  exposure. Implementing VPC configurations helps ensure data privacy, reduces the
  attack surface, and aligns with best practices for network security and compliance
  frameworks, thereby providing a secure environment for machine learning operations.
