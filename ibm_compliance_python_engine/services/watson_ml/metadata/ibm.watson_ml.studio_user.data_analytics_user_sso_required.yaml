title: Enforce SSO for Watson ML Studio Data Analytics Users
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO) for data analytics users in Watson ML Studio
  is crucial for enhancing security and streamlining user access management. It reduces
  the risk of unauthorized access by ensuring that all user authentications are centralized
  and adhere to corporate security policies, thereby minimizing potential breaches
  and protecting sensitive data.
description: This security rule checks whether SSO is mandatory for users accessing
  the Watson ML Studio for data analytics purposes. By mandating SSO, organizations
  can ensure that all user access is authenticated through a single, secure entry
  point, which simplifies identity management and enhances security oversight. This
  practice not only strengthens the overall security posture by reducing password
  fatigue and associated risks but also aids in compliance with various industry standards
  and regulations that require robust identity and access management protocols.
