title: Enforce TLS for Secure Data Analytics in Watson ML Studio
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enforced for data analytics
  parameters in Watson Machine Learning Studio is crucial for protecting data in transit
  from eavesdropping and tampering. By requiring TLS, organizations can safeguard
  sensitive data interactions, thereby maintaining data integrity and confidentiality
  which are essential for compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether TLS is enabled for data analytics parameter
  groups in IBM Watson Machine Learning Studio. Enforcing TLS ensures that all data
  transmitted between clients and the Watson ML service is encrypted, protecting against
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This security measure not only
  fortifies the platform's defense against cyber threats but also helps organizations
  adhere to industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection and
  privacy. By implementing this rule, organizations can enhance their overall security
  posture and demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding sensitive data.
