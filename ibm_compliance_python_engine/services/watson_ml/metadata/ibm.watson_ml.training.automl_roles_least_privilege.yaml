title: Enforce Least Privilege for Watson ML AutoML Training Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the principle of least privilege for Watson ML AutoML roles is
  critical to minimizing security risks. By ensuring users and services have only
  the permissions necessary for their tasks, we reduce the potential attack vectors
  and limit the impact of any unauthorized access. This approach not only protects
  sensitive data but also helps maintain business continuity and compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This security rule checks that Watson Machine Learning AutoML roles are
  assigned with the least privilege necessary for training tasks. It evaluates role
  assignments to ensure that users and services do not have excessive permissions
  beyond what is required for their specific functions. By adhering to this principle,
  organizations can enhance their security posture by reducing the risk of accidental
  or malicious misuse of privileges. Implementing least privilege also supports compliance
  with regulations that mandate strict access controls and data protection measures.
