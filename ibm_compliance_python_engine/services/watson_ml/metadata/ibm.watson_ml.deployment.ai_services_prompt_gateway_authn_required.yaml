rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_services_prompt_gateway_authn_required
title: Ensure Authentication for Watson AI Services Prompt Gateway
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing authentication for the Watson AI Services Prompt Gateway is critical
  to safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users can access
  and interact with AI models. Without proper authentication, organizations risk unauthorized
  access, data breaches, and potential manipulation of AI models, which can lead to
  incorrect decision-making and compliance violations.
description: This rule verifies that authentication is enabled for the Watson AI Services
  Prompt Gateway in IBM Watson Machine Learning deployments. By requiring authentication,
  the rule ensures that all interactions with AI services are conducted securely,
  preventing unauthorized access and potential data leaks. This measure not only enhances
  the security posture of an organization but also aids in meeting compliance requirements,
  such as those outlined in GDPR and other data protection regulations, by ensuring
  that access to sensitive AI data is controlled and monitored.
