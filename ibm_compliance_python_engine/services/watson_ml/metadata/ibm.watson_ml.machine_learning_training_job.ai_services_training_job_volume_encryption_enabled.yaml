title: Ensure Volume Encryption for AI Services Training Jobs in IBM Watson ML
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling volume encryption for AI services training jobs is critical to
  safeguarding sensitive data processed and stored during machine learning tasks.
  Without encryption, data is vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading
  to data breaches that can harm organizational reputation and result in financial
  penalties. Ensuring encryption at rest helps meet regulatory compliance requirements
  and enhances data privacy.
description: This rule verifies that all machine learning training jobs in IBM Watson
  Machine Learning utilize volume encryption to protect data at rest. When enabled,
  this feature encrypts the storage volumes used during training, ensuring that any
  sensitive data remains secure from unauthorized access. By implementing this rule,
  organizations not only enhance their security posture but also align with industry
  best practices and compliance standards like GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate rigorous
  data protection measures.
