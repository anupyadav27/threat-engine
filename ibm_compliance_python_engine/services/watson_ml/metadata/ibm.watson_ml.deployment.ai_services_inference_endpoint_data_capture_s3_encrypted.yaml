title: Ensure S3 Encryption for AI Inference Data Capture in Watson ML Deployments
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI inference endpoint data captures stored in S3 is crucial
  to safeguard sensitive information and maintain data privacy. Unencrypted data can
  be vulnerable to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance
  with industry regulations, which can have significant business and reputational
  impacts.
description: This rule verifies that data captured from AI inference endpoints in
  Watson Machine Learning deployments is stored in S3 buckets with encryption enabled.
  Encryption at rest ensures that data is unreadable to unauthorized users, thus enhancing
  the security posture of the deployment. Implementing encryption aligns with data
  protection and privacy standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, providing compliance benefits
  and reducing the risk of data exposure.
