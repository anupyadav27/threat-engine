rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_workspace.data_analytics_workgroup_query_result_encryption_enabled
title: Mandatory Encryption of Query Results in Watson ML Studio Workspaces
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for query results in Watson ML Studio workspaces is
  crucial to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  Encryption at rest ensures that data is protected even if storage is compromised,
  thereby maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of business-critical analytics
  outputs. This measure not only mitigates security risks but also supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for data analytics workgroup
  query results within IBM Watson ML Studio workspaces. By enforcing encryption at
  rest, the rule ensures that all data outputs from analytical queries are securely
  stored, preventing unauthorized access and tampering. This enhances the overall
  security posture of data analytics operations and aligns with compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations, providing assurance
  to stakeholders that sensitive data is handled securely.
