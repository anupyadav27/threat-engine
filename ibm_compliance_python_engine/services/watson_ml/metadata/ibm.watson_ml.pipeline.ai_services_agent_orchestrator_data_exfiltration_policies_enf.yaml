title: Enforce Data Exfiltration Policies for Watson ML Pipelines
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing data exfiltration policies within Watson Machine Learning (ML)
  pipelines is essential to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access or transfer.
  Without strict controls, there is a risk of data breaches, which can lead to reputational
  damage and financial losses due to non-compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule ensures that data exfiltration policies are enforced for the
  AI Services Agent Orchestrator within Watson ML pipelines. It verifies that encryption
  at rest is in place for data handled by these orchestrators, thereby protecting
  sensitive information from unauthorized access. Enforcing these policies strengthens
  the overall security posture by mitigating the risk of data leaks and aligning with
  industry compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
