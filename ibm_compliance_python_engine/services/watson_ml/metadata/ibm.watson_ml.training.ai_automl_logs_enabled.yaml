rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.training.ai_automl_logs_enabled
title: Ensure AI AutoML Logs are Enabled for Watson ML Training
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling AI AutoML logs for Watson Machine Learning training is crucial
  for maintaining transparency and traceability of model development processes. Logging
  provides insights into model training activities, helping to detect anomalies, optimize
  performance, and ensure compliance with industry regulations. Without logs, organizations
  may face difficulties in identifying issues, which can lead to increased operational
  risks and potential compliance violations.
description: This rule checks whether AI AutoML logging is enabled for Watson Machine
  Learning training sessions. By ensuring that logs are activated, organizations can
  capture detailed records of training events, including configuration settings, data
  inputs, and processing steps. This enhances the security posture by allowing for
  the monitoring and auditing of machine learning activities, aiding in anomaly detection
  and forensic investigations. Furthermore, maintaining comprehensive logs supports
  compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards by providing
  a verifiable trail of model training processes.
