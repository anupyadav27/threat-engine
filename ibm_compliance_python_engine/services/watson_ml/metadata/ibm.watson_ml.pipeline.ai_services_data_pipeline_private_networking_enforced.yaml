rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.ai_services_data_pipeline_private_networking_enforced
title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Data Pipelines in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that AI services data pipelines in Watson Machine Learning (WML)
  are configured to use private networking is crucial for protecting sensitive data.
  This rule mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting
  data transmission to secured, internal networks, thereby preserving the integrity
  and confidentiality of the data.
description: This rule checks for the enforcement of private networking configurations
  on AI services data pipelines within the Watson Machine Learning service. By ensuring
  that pipelines are not accessible over public networks, it enhances security by
  limiting exposure to potential external threats. This configuration aligns with
  best practices for network security, reducing the risk of data leakage and unauthorized
  access. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to regulatory standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data protection measures.
