title: Ensure Least Privilege for Watson ML Ops Monitoring Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Watson ML Ops monitoring
  roles minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By
  restricting roles to only the necessary permissions, organizations can enhance their
  security posture and reduce the likelihood of insider threats, ensuring that sensitive
  machine learning operations data is adequately protected. This approach also aids
  in maintaining compliance with industry regulations and standards.
description: This rule checks that Watson Machine Learning (ML) Ops monitoring roles
  are configured with the least privilege necessary for their functions. It ensures
  that users and service accounts only have the permissions required to perform their
  specific tasks, thereby reducing the attack surface and potential for exploitation.
  Implementing least privilege access controls is a critical component of identity
  and access management, helping organizations safeguard their ML infrastructures
  against unauthorized access and maintain compliance with security best practices
  and regulatory requirements.
