rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_snapshot.data_analytics_snapshot_not_publicly_shared
title: Ensure Data Analytics Snapshots Are Not Publicly Shared
severity: critical
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Protecting data analytics snapshots from unauthorized access is crucial
  for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Publicly shared
  snapshots can lead to data breaches, exposing critical business insights and potentially
  damaging an organization's reputation and financial standing. Ensuring that snapshots
  are not publicly accessible helps mitigate risks associated with data leaks and
  unauthorized data manipulation.
description: This rule checks the sharing settings of IBM Watson Machine Learning
  studio snapshots to ensure they are not publicly accessible. By enforcing private
  access to data analytics snapshots, organizations can safeguard against unauthorized
  data exposure, aligning with industry best practices for data protection and regulatory
  compliance. This measure enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that
  backups are only accessible to authorized personnel, thus improving resilience and
  disaster recovery capabilities.
