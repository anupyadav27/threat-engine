title: Ensure AI Services Model Artifacts are Encrypted with CMEK at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI service model artifacts at rest using Customer-Managed Encryption
  Keys (CMEK) is crucial for maintaining data privacy and protecting sensitive information
  from unauthorized access. This practice enhances security by ensuring that only
  authorized users with the correct encryption keys can access the data, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether AI service model artifacts in IBM Watson Machine
  Learning are encrypted at rest using CMEK. By implementing this encryption method,
  businesses can ensure that their model data is protected with keys managed by them,
  providing an additional layer of control over data access. This approach not only
  strengthens security posture by preventing unauthorized access but also aids in
  compliance with industry standards and regulations concerning data protection and
  privacy, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
