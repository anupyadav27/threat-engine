title: Ensure Watson ML Models VPC Settings Are Configured and Enabled
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring VPC settings for Watson Machine Learning models is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and isolated environment. By ensuring that models are deployed
  within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you reduce exposure to potential unauthorized
  access from the public internet, thereby mitigating risks associated with data breaches.
  Proper VPC configuration enhances the overall security posture, ensuring compliance
  with organizational and regulatory requirements for data protection.
description: This rule checks whether the Watson Machine Learning models are configured
  to use VPC settings, ensuring that network access is restricted to a private, controlled
  environment. By enabling VPC settings, you can enforce network segmentation and
  isolate workloads, significantly reducing the attack surface. This configuration
  is essential for adhering to best practices in network security and connectivity,
  providing an additional layer of defense against external threats. Furthermore,
  it aligns with compliance frameworks that mandate strict access controls and data
  privacy protocols.
