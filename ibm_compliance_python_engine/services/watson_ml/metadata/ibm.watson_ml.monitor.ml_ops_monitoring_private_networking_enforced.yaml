title: Enforce Private Networking for IBM Watson ML Ops Monitoring
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Watson ML Ops monitoring operates over private networks
  is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining the confidentiality and
  integrity of machine learning operations. By confining data flow to private networking,
  organizations reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby
  upholding trust and compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Watson ML Ops monitoring is configured to
  use private networking, restricting traffic to a secure and isolated environment.
  By enforcing private network communication, it minimizes exposure to potential threats
  and unauthorized access attempts from public networks. Implementing private networking
  enhances security posture by ensuring that monitoring data remains within trusted
  boundaries, thus aligning with network security best practices and compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular compliance with this rule enhances the reliability
  and trustworthiness of machine learning operations within IBM Cloud.
