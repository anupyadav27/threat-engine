rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.ai_services_model_version_image_scan_passed
title: Ensure AI Model Image Scan Passes for Secure Deployment
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that AI model versions undergo a successful image scan is crucial
  for identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating risks associated with deploying untrusted
  or compromised components. This practice not only enhances the security posture
  of the AI services but also prevents potential exploits that could lead to data
  breaches or service disruptions, thereby safeguarding business integrity and customer
  trust.
description: This rule verifies that each version of an AI model deployed on IBM Watson
  Machine Learning has undergone a comprehensive image scan and passed without critical
  vulnerabilities. The scanning process checks for known security issues, outdated
  software, and potential misconfigurations in container images, ensuring that only
  secure and compliant models are utilized in production environments. By adhering
  to this rule, organizations can maintain a robust security framework, aligning with
  industry standards and regulatory requirements, while enhancing their compliance
  posture in container and Kubernetes environments.
