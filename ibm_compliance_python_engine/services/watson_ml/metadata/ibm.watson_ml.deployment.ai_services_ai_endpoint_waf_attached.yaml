rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_services_ai_endpoint_waf_attached
title: Ensure WAF is Attached to AI Endpoint in Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to AI endpoints in Watson Machine
  Learning is crucial for protecting against common web threats and vulnerabilities,
  such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. This measure helps safeguard sensitive
  data processed by AI models, ensuring the integrity and availability of AI services
  which is vital for maintaining customer trust and business continuity.
description: This rule checks whether a Web Application Firewall is attached to AI
  service endpoints deployed within IBM Watson Machine Learning. By enforcing this
  security measure, the rule enhances protection against malicious attacks targeting
  the application layer. Compliance with this rule not only strengthens the security
  posture by mitigating potential threats but also aligns with industry best practices
  for network security and data protection, contributing to overall compliance with
  regulatory standards.
