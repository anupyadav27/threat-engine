title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Services Feature Store RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle for Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) in IBM Watson Machine Learning's AI Services Feature Store is crucial to
  minimizing security risks. By ensuring users have the minimum level of access necessary
  to perform their tasks, organizations can prevent unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches, thus safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that RBAC configurations for IBM Watson Machine Learning's
  AI Services Feature Store adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks
  that users and service identities are granted only the permissions they need to
  fulfill their specific roles, without excessive access to data assets. Enhancing
  security by limiting access helps reduce the attack surface and protects against
  internal and external threats. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to regulatory
  requirements and best practices for identity and access management, ensuring that
  access permissions are appropriately scoped.
