title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for Watson ML Deployment Endpoints
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for Watson ML deployment
  endpoints is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. Without encryption, data at
  rest is vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can lead to data breaches and loss
  of customer trust. Implementing KMS encryption not only enhances data confidentiality
  but also ensures compliance with industry regulations and corporate data protection
  policies.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for all Watson ML deployment
  endpoints, ensuring that data at rest is encrypted using a customer-managed key.
  By leveraging IBM Key Protect or IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services for managing
  encryption keys, organizations can maintain control over access to their sensitive
  data. This practice supports adherence to data protection standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, providing an additional layer of security and reducing the risk of data
  exposure.
