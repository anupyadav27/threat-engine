title: Ensure Least Privilege for Watson ML AutoML Training Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Watson Machine Learning
  AutoML roles minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of sensitive
  data. This practice is crucial for maintaining robust security postures, as excessive
  permissions can lead to data breaches and compliance violations, potentially resulting
  in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule ensures that roles assigned to Watson Machine Learning AutoML
  training resources are restricted to the minimum permissions necessary for their
  function. By evaluating the permissions associated with these roles, this rule helps
  to prevent unnecessary access to sensitive data and operations. Adhering to least
  privilege principles not only enhances security but also aligns with regulatory
  compliance requirements, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific
  actions within the Watson ML environment.
