rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.training.hpo_logs_enabled
title: Ensure HPO Logs are Enabled for Watson ML Training Sessions
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling HPO (Hyperparameter Optimization) logs in Watson Machine Learning
  (Watson ML) is crucial for maintaining a detailed audit trail of training activities.
  This practice enhances transparency in model training processes, enabling organizations
  to trace and verify the parameters and configurations used. It also aids in identifying
  anomalies and ensuring compliance with data governance and regulatory standards,
  thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized model changes or data breaches.
description: The security rule ibm.watson_ml.training.hpo_logs_enabled checks whether
  HPO logging is enabled for training jobs in IBM Watson Machine Learning. Enabling
  these logs ensures all hyperparameter tuning activities are recorded, providing
  a comprehensive audit trail that can be used for both internal assessments and external
  compliance audits. This elevates the security posture by allowing organizations
  to monitor and review the configurations and parameters used during model training,
  thus mitigating potential security and compliance risks associated with unauthorized
  changes or configurations.
