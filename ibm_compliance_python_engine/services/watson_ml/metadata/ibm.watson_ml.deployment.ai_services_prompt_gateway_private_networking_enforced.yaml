title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML AI Services Prompt Gateway
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Watson Machine Learning deployments utilize private networking
  for AI Services Prompt Gateway is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining
  secure communications. This measure reduces the attack surface by preventing unauthorized
  access over the public internet, thus mitigating the risk of data breaches and maintaining
  the integrity of AI models.
description: This rule checks whether Watson Machine Learning deployments have configured
  the AI Services Prompt Gateway to operate exclusively over private networks. By
  enforcing this network configuration, organizations can ensure that data exchanged
  between AI services remains within secure, controlled environments. This approach
  not only enhances security by limiting exposure to external threats but also supports
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements pertaining to data
  protection and privacy.
