title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Model Registry RBAC in Watson ML
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle in AI Model Registry access
  controls is critical to minimizing the risk of unauthorized data access and potential
  exposure of sensitive AI models. By restricting permissions to only those necessary
  for users to perform their roles, organizations can reduce the attack surface, thereby
  protecting intellectual property and maintaining compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This rule ensures that access to the AI Model Registry within Watson
  Machine Learning is limited to the minimum necessary permissions required for users
  to perform their specific tasks. By evaluating the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  settings, the rule verifies that no excessive privileges are granted, aligning with
  best practices in identity and access management. This approach not only strengthens
  the security posture but also aids in compliance with regulatory standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA by safeguarding sensitive model data and ensuring that only authorized
  users have access.
