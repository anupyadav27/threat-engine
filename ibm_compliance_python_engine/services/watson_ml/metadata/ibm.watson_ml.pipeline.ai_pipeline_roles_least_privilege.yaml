rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.ai_pipeline_roles_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Pipeline Roles in IBM Watson ML
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that AI pipeline roles in IBM Watson Machine Learning adhere to
  the principle of least privilege is crucial for minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. By limiting access rights to only those necessary
  for specific tasks, organizations can significantly reduce the attack surface and
  protect sensitive information, thereby maintaining trust and compliance with regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule verifies that AI pipeline roles within IBM Watson Machine Learning
  are configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks for excessive
  permissions that may be granted to users or services interacting with AI pipelines,
  ensuring that each role has access only to the resources and actions required for
  its function. Implementing this rule enhances security by reducing the likelihood
  of privilege escalation and unauthorized access, while also supporting compliance
  with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA that mandate strict access controls.
