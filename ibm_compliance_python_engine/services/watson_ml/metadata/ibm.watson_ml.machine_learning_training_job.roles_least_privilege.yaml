title: Enforce Least Privilege for Watson ML Training Job Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Watson Machine Learning
  training jobs is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  misuse of sensitive data. By ensuring that users and services only have the permissions
  necessary for their roles, organizations can prevent privilege escalation attacks
  and reduce the attack surface, thus safeguarding their machine learning models and
  data assets.
description: This rule ensures that all roles assigned to Watson Machine Learning
  training jobs adhere to the principle of least privilege. It involves auditing and
  restricting permissions to only those necessary for the specific tasks associated
  with the training jobs. By enforcing this rule, organizations enhance their security
  posture by preventing unnecessary access to critical resources, thereby aligning
  with best practices in identity and access management and improving compliance with
  regulatory standards.
