title: Ensure AI Services Dataset S3 Encryption at Rest for Data Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is crucial in protecting sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This security measure helps maintain
  the confidentiality and integrity of datasets used by AI services, thereby reducing
  the risk of data leaks and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Failure to encrypt data at rest can lead to severe business
  impacts, including reputation damage, legal penalties, and financial losses.
description: This rule verifies that datasets used by Watson Machine Learning services
  are encrypted at rest when stored in S3. It ensures that the encryption protocols
  meet industry standards, providing robust protection against unauthorized data access.
  By enforcing encryption at rest, this rule enhances the security posture of the
  IBM Cloud environment, aligning with best practices for data protection and privacy.
  This compliance measure supports businesses in meeting legal and regulatory requirements,
  thereby safeguarding customer trust and organizational credibility.
