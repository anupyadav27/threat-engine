title: Enforce Authz Policies on Watson ML Deployment Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing authorization policies on Watson ML deployment endpoints is crucial
  to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access machine learning
  models. This practice mitigates unauthorized access risks, protecting sensitive
  data and intellectual property. It also aligns with regulatory requirements, minimizing
  potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that authorization policies are enforced on endpoints
  for Watson Machine Learning deployments. It ensures that access to ML models is
  restricted based on predefined authorization rules, enhancing the security of the
  deployed solutions. By implementing this control, organizations can safeguard data
  integrity and confidentiality while demonstrating compliance with industry standards
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict access controls.
