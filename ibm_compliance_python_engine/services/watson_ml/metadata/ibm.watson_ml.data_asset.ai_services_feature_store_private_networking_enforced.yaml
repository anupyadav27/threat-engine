title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Feature Store in IBM Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for AI Services Feature Store in Watson Machine
  Learning ensures that data assets are securely accessed and transferred within the
  IBM Cloud infrastructure. This rule mitigates risks associated with unauthorized
  access and data breaches by restricting network access to private, controlled environments.
  It contributes to maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, which is crucial
  for organizations handling sensitive AI models and datasets.
description: This rule checks whether the AI Services Feature Store within IBM Watson
  Machine Learning is configured to use private networking. By enforcing private network
  connectivity, data traffic is confined to the IBM Cloud's internal network, reducing
  exposure to potential external threats. This configuration enhances the security
  posture by limiting access to trusted entities and aligns with best practices for
  network security and access control. Ensuring private networking is activated helps
  organizations meet compliance requirements for data protection, such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, by safeguarding sensitive AI data from unauthorized external access.
