rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.registry_artifact_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Watson ML Registry Artifact Encryption is Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for registry artifacts in IBM Watson Machine Learning
  is crucial for protecting sensitive model data from unauthorized access. Encryption
  safeguards data integrity and confidentiality, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations. This protection
  is vital for maintaining customer trust and avoiding legal penalties.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for artifacts stored in
  the Watson Machine Learning registry. By ensuring that all stored models and associated
  artifacts are encrypted at rest, this rule enhances the security posture of your
  machine learning workflows. Encrypted data is less vulnerable to unauthorized access
  and data leaks, thereby ensuring that sensitive information remains secure. Compliance
  with this rule facilitates adherence to data protection regulations, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, and aligns with IBM Cloud's best practices for data protection and privacy.
