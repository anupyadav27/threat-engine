title: Enforce Encryption at Rest for IBM Watson Studio AI Services Workspace
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that data is encrypted at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  information from unauthorized access and potential breaches. In the context of AI
  services, where substantial amounts of data are processed and analyzed, encryption
  at rest mitigates risks associated with data theft or exposure, thereby safeguarding
  intellectual property and maintaining customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for IBM
  Watson Machine Learning Studio workspaces within the AI services environment. By
  enforcing encryption, data stored in these workspaces is protected using advanced
  cryptographic methods, thereby preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance
  with data protection regulations. This practice not only enhances the security posture
  of the organization but also aligns with industry standards and legal requirements,
  providing assurance to stakeholders regarding the confidentiality and integrity
  of their data.
