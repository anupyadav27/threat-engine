title: Ensure Least Privilege for Data Analytics Cluster Admin Access
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Data Analytics Cluster
  Admin access is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By restricting admin permissions to only those necessary for specific
  tasks, organizations can minimize the attack surface and enhance overall security
  posture, ultimately preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  of critical data.
description: This rule checks that admin access to Watson Machine Learning Studio
  Clusters is configured according to the principle of least privilege. It verifies
  that users or service accounts with administrative privileges are limited to those
  roles essential for performing specific tasks. By enforcing least privilege, this
  control reduces the likelihood of accidental or malicious data exposure, aligns
  with best practices for identity and access management, and supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring that only authorized
  personnel can perform admin tasks helps protect sensitive data and maintain system
  integrity.
