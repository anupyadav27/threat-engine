rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.monitor.ml_ops_monitoring_outputs_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure MLOps Monitoring Outputs Are Encrypted and Private
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting MLOps monitoring outputs ensures that sensitive data remains
  confidential and protected from unauthorized access. By keeping this data private,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with data breaches and comply with regulatory
  requirements, thus preserving customer trust and avoiding potential legal liabilities.
description: This rule verifies that all outputs from MLOps monitoring within the
  Watson Machine Learning service are encrypted at rest and maintained in a private
  state. It checks for proper implementation of encryption protocols, ensuring that
  data is safeguarded using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This enhances
  security by preventing unauthorized data access and supports compliance with data
  protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent data security
  measures.
