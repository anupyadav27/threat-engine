title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Human Review UI
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for the Watson Machine Learning Human Review
  UI is critical to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that this interface is accessible only through private networks, organizations can
  safeguard sensitive data and protect intellectual property, thereby maintaining
  compliance with industry regulations and enhancing customer trust.
description: This rule ensures that the Human Review UI within the Watson Machine
  Learning pipeline is configured to operate exclusively over private networks. The
  check verifies that network access controls are in place, limiting exposure to the
  public internet and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Implementing this
  control enhances the overall security posture by adhering to best practices in network
  security and connectivity, and it aligns with compliance requirements by ensuring
  that sensitive operations are conducted securely within a controlled network environment.
