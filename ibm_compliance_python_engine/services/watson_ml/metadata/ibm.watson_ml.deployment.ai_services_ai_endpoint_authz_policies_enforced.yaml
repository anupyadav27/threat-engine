title: Enforce AI Endpoint Authorization Policies for Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that AI endpoint authorization policies are enforced is vital
  for securing Watson Machine Learning deployments. Unauthorized access to AI services
  can lead to data breaches and misuse of AI models, which can have significant business
  impacts, including financial loss and reputational damage. By enforcing strict access
  controls, organizations can protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized
  users and applications can access their AI endpoints.
description: This rule verifies that AI endpoint authorization policies are applied
  to deployments within the Watson Machine Learning service. It checks whether the
  necessary access controls are in place and enforced to prevent unauthorized access
  to AI services. By implementing these policies, organizations can enhance their
  security posture by ensuring that AI endpoints are accessible only to authenticated
  and authorized entities. This practice not only bolsters security but also aids
  in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements related
  to data protection and privacy.
