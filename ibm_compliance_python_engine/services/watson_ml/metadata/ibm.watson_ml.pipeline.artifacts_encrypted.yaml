rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.artifacts_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Watson ML Pipeline Artifacts at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting machine learning pipeline artifacts through encryption at rest
  is essential to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches.
  Failure to encrypt these artifacts can lead to exposure of confidential models and
  data, potentially resulting in significant financial and reputational damage. Implementing
  encryption ensures compliance with data protection regulations and enhances trust
  in the IBM Cloud environment.
description: This rule verifies that all artifacts generated within Watson Machine
  Learning pipelines are encrypted at rest, ensuring they are stored securely using
  robust encryption standards. By enforcing encryption, the rule mitigates risks associated
  with data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. It aligns with
  data protection best practices and regulatory requirements, providing organizations
  with a stronger security posture and facilitating compliance with industry standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
