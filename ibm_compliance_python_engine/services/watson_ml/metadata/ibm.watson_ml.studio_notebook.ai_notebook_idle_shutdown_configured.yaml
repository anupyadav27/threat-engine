title: Ensure AI Notebook Idle Shutdown is Configured in Watson ML
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring idle shutdown for AI notebooks in Watson Machine Learning is
  crucial for reducing unnecessary resource consumption and minimizing potential security
  risks. Inactive notebooks can become vulnerable to unauthorized access or exploitation,
  thereby posing a threat to data confidentiality and integrity. Enforcing idle shutdown
  helps organizations optimize cloud resource usage and maintain a robust security
  posture.
description: This rule checks whether idle shutdown settings are configured for AI
  notebooks within IBM Watson Machine Learning Studio. By enabling this feature, organizations
  can automatically terminate idle sessions, thus preventing unauthorized access to
  sensitive data and reducing the attack surface. This configuration aligns with best
  practices for cloud security and helps maintain compliance with industry standards
  by ensuring that unused resources are not left exposed, thereby enhancing both operational
  efficiency and security posture.
