rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_services_ai_endpoint_private_networking_enforced
title: Enforce Private Networking for AI Services Endpoints in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that AI services endpoints within Watson Machine Learning (Watson
  ML) are restricted to private networking is crucial for maintaining data integrity
  and confidentiality. This security measure mitigates the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches, which can lead to significant business disruptions
  and compliance violations.
description: This rule checks that AI service endpoints within Watson ML deployments
  are configured to use private networking. By enforcing private network access, the
  rule ensures that sensitive data and AI models are only accessible within a secure,
  internal network environment. This configuration reduces the attack surface by preventing
  exposure to public networks, thereby enhancing the overall security posture. Compliance
  with this rule helps organizations adhere to best practices in network security
  and meet regulatory standards for data protection.
