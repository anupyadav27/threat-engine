title: Enforce TLS 1.2 or Higher for Watson ML Data Analytics Clusters
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher for data analytics clusters in Watson Machine
  Learning is crucial for maintaining secure data transmission. It protects sensitive
  data from interception and tampering during transit, thereby safeguarding against
  potential data breaches. This compliance measure also aligns with industry best
  practices and regulatory requirements, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality
  of data processed by Watson ML.
description: This security rule verifies that all data analytics clusters within the
  Watson Machine Learning service enforce a minimum of TLS 1.2 for data transmission.
  By ensuring TLS 1.2 or higher, the rule enhances the security posture by preventing
  the use of outdated, vulnerable encryption protocols. This not only strengthens
  data protection but also helps in meeting compliance with standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate secure data handling practices. Regular compliance checks
  against this rule can identify misconfigurations early, reducing the risk of data
  exposure.
