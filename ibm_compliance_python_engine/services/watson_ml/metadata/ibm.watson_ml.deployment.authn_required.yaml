rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.authn_required
title: Mandatory Authentication for Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing authentication for Watson Machine Learning deployments is vital
  to ensure that access to machine learning models and data is restricted to authorized
  users only. This prevents unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches
  or manipulation of machine learning models, ultimately protecting sensitive business
  information and maintaining the integrity of AI-driven decisions.
description: This rule verifies that all Watson Machine Learning deployments require
  proper authentication before any access is granted. By ensuring that authentication
  mechanisms are in place, this rule enhances the security posture by preventing unauthorized
  access to machine learning resources. Implementing this control is essential for
  maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations, as it ensures that
  only authenticated users can interact with potentially sensitive data and models,
  thereby reducing the risk of data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
