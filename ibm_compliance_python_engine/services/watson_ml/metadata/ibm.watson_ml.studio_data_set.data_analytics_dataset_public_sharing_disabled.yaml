rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_data_set.data_analytics_dataset_public_sharing_disabled
title: Disable Public Sharing for Watson ML Studio Data Analytics Datasets
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Public sharing of data analytics datasets can lead to unauthorized access
  and data breaches, jeopardizing sensitive information and violating compliance standards.
  Ensuring that datasets are not publicly accessible strengthens data privacy and
  aligns with industry best practices for data protection, minimizing the risk of
  reputational and financial damage to the organization.
description: This rule checks whether public sharing is disabled for data analytics
  datasets within the Watson Machine Learning Studio. By enforcing restrictions on
  public access, this rule enhances the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated
  and authorized users can access the datasets. This approach not only fortifies data
  privacy but also supports compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate stringent controls over data access and sharing.
