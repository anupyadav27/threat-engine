title: Enforce Minimal User Roles for Watson ML Studio Data Analytics
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing minimal user roles for Watson ML Studio ensures that users
  only have the necessary permissions required to perform their specific tasks, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This principle of least
  privilege is crucial for maintaining robust security and ensuring compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks that users assigned to Watson ML Studio for data analytics
  have the minimal roles necessary to perform their duties, aligning with the principle
  of least privilege. By restricting permissions, this rule helps mitigate the risk
  of unauthorized data access and manipulation, and minimizes the attack surface within
  the IBM Cloud environment. Adhering to this rule enhances the organization’s security
  posture and aids in meeting compliance requirements, such as those set by GDPR and
  HIPAA, by ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.
