title: Ensure S3 Encryption for AI Services Feature Store Offline Data
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest in the AI Services Feature Store's offline S3 storage
  is crucial to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This measure is particularly important for maintaining the privacy
  and integrity of data assets used in training and deploying AI models, ultimately
  ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and enhancing customer trust.
description: This security rule verifies that all data stored in the AI Services Feature
  Store's offline S3 buckets within Watson Machine Learning is encrypted using server-side
  encryption. By enforcing encryption at rest, this rule helps secure data assets
  against unauthorized access and cyber threats, thereby reducing the risk of data
  breaches. Implementing this rule aligns with best practices and regulatory requirements
  for data protection, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and
  intact throughout its lifecycle.
