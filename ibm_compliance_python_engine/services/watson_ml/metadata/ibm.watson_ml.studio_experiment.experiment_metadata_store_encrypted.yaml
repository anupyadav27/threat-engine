title: Ensure Encryption of Experiment Metadata Store in IBM Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting the metadata store for Watson Machine Learning experiments is
  crucial to protect sensitive information and intellectual property from unauthorized
  access. Data breaches involving unencrypted data can lead to significant financial
  losses, legal penalties, and reputational damage, thus encryption at rest is essential
  to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.
description: This rule verifies that the metadata store associated with Watson Machine
  Learning studio experiments is encrypted at rest, ensuring that all sensitive experiment
  details are protected. Encryption at rest enhances security by preventing data from
  being readable and useful to unauthorized users if compromised. Adhering to this
  rule helps organizations meet various data protection regulations, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, by ensuring that sensitive data is adequately protected against unauthorized
  access.
