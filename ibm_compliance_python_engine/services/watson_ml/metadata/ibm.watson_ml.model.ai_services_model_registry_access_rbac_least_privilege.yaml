title: Enforce RBAC Least Privilege for Watson ML Model Registry
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege in access management for
  Watson ML Model Registry ensures that users only have the permissions necessary
  to perform their specific roles. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access
  to sensitive AI models and reduces potential attack vectors, safeguarding business-critical
  data and intellectual property.
description: This rule verifies that access to the Watson ML Model Registry is configured
  following the least privilege principle, using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
  It checks that users and services are granted only the permissions essential for
  their tasks, preventing excessive or unnecessary access rights. Enforcing least
  privilege helps mitigate security risks, strengthens compliance with data protection
  regulations, and ensures a robust security posture by limiting potential exposure
  to malicious activities.
