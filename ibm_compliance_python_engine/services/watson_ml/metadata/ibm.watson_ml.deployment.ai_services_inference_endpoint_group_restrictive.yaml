rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.ai_services_inference_endpoint_group_restrictive
title: Restrict AI Services Inference Endpoint Group Access in Watson ML
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring restrictive access to AI services inference endpoints in Watson
  Machine Learning prevents unauthorized users from exploiting these resources, reducing
  the risk of data breaches and unauthorized use. By limiting access to only necessary
  groups, organizations can maintain control over their AI workloads, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive information and maintaining compliance with security policies.
description: This rule checks whether Watson Machine Learning deployment inference
  endpoints are configured with restrictive access controls. It ensures that only
  specified groups have access to the AI services, thereby minimizing the attack surface.
  By implementing network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups, this rule
  helps to adhere to best practices in network security, ensuring that only authorized
  users can interact with the AI models. This enhances the overall security posture
  and supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
