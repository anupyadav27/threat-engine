title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML HPO Training
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Watson Machine Learning (ML) Hyperparameter
  Optimization (HPO) training ensures that sensitive data and configurations remain
  isolated from public networks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches, helping organizations maintain the integrity and confidentiality
  of their machine learning models. By limiting network exposure, businesses can better
  comply with strict regulatory requirements and safeguard their intellectual property.
description: This security rule mandates that all Watson ML HPO training processes
  are conducted within a private network environment, effectively restricting external
  access. The rule checks for network configurations that isolate training workloads
  from public internet exposure, enforcing security best practices in network access
  control. Implementing this rule enhances the security posture by reducing attack
  vectors and ensuring compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and CCPA, which
  require robust data protection measures.
