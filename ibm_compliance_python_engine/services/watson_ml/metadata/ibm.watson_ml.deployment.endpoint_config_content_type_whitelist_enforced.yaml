title: Enforcing Content Type Whitelist for Watson ML Deployment Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing a content type whitelist for Watson Machine Learning deployment
  endpoints is crucial to prevent potential security vulnerabilities arising from
  the processing of unexpected or malicious data formats. This rule ensures that only
  explicitly allowed content types are processed, minimizing the risk of exploiting
  application logic, which could lead to data breaches or service disruptions. Maintaining
  strict control over content types contributes to a robust security posture, thereby
  safeguarding sensitive machine learning operations and enhancing trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that Watson Machine Learning deployment endpoints
  enforce a content type whitelist, allowing only specified data formats to be processed.
  By checking the configuration of deployment endpoints, this rule ensures that only
  predefined content types are accepted, effectively mitigating risks associated with
  processing untrusted or malicious content. Implementing such controls is a key aspect
  of network access control, enhancing the security of data transactions between clients
  and the Watson ML service. In addition to providing a security enhancement, this
  practice supports compliance with industry standards and regulations that require
  strict access control measures.
