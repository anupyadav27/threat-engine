title: Ensure CMEK Encryption for Watson ML Studio Snapshots at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest using Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) is
  crucial for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. It mitigates
  the risk of data breaches by ensuring that data remains secure even if storage is
  compromised. This practice also supports compliance with industry regulations and
  enhances trust with customers by demonstrating a commitment to data privacy and
  protection.
description: This rule checks whether data analytics snapshots within IBM Watson Machine
  Learning Studio are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys. Implementing
  CMEK allows organizations to have greater control over cryptographic keys, thus
  strengthening data security posture. Adhering to this standard not only improves
  the security of the stored data but also helps in meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures.
