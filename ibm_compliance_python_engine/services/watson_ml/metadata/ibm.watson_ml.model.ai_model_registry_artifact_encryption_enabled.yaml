rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.ai_model_registry_artifact_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure AI Model Registry Artifacts Are Encrypted at Rest
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for AI model registry artifacts is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Encryption at rest helps
  mitigate risks associated with data theft or exposure, ensuring that AI models and
  associated metadata are secure. This practice not only provides a robust layer of
  data protection but also helps organizations comply with industry regulations and
  standards for data privacy and security.
description: This rule checks whether the AI model registry artifacts stored within
  the IBM Watson Machine Learning service are encrypted at rest. By ensuring encryption
  is enabled, organizations can safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of their
  AI models, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This measure
  enhances the overall security posture by adhering to data protection best practices
  and helps maintain compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate
  the protection of personal and sensitive data.
