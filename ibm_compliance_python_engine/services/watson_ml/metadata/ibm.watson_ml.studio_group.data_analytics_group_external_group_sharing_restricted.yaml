rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_group.data_analytics_group_external_group_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict External Sharing in Watson ML Studio for Data Protection
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Restricting external sharing of data analytics groups in Watson Machine
  Learning Studio is essential to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access
  and potential breaches. This ensures that only authorized personnel within your
  organization can access critical data, thereby reducing the risk of data leakage
  and maintaining business integrity.
description: This rule verifies that external sharing of data analytics groups within
  Watson Machine Learning Studio is restricted. By implementing this rule, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized external access to datasets and analytical models, thereby
  strengthening data protection measures. It aligns with encryption at rest best practices
  by ensuring that data is only accessible by trusted internal parties, thus enhancing
  overall security posture and aiding in compliance with data protection regulations.
