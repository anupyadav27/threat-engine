title: Enforce Private Networking for Watson ML Pipeline UI Access
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for Watson Machine Learning (ML) pipeline
  UI access is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. By ensuring
  that the UI is only accessible over a private network, organizations can protect
  sensitive machine learning models and data from external threats, thereby reducing
  the risk of exposure and maintaining data integrity.
description: This security rule verifies that the Watson ML pipeline UI is configured
  to enforce private networking, ensuring that access is restricted to authorized
  users within the same private network. By enforcing this control, it limits exposure
  to the public internet, significantly reducing the attack surface. This practice
  enhances security by ensuring that only users within the organization's network
  can access the pipeline UI, thus maintaining compliance with industry standards
  and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy.
