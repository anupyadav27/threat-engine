rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_experiment.experiment_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Watson ML Studio Experiment Logs are Enabled for Audit
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling experiment logs for Watson Machine Learning Studio is crucial
  for maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of all activities and changes within
  machine learning experiments. This practice enhances accountability and traceability,
  allowing for quick identification and resolution of any unauthorized or anomalous
  behavior. Additionally, it is fundamental for meeting compliance requirements and
  supporting forensic investigations in case of security incidents.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for Watson ML Studio experiments.
  By ensuring that experiment logs are active, organizations can capture detailed
  records of experiment executions, changes, and outcomes. These logs facilitate continuous
  monitoring and auditing, providing visibility into user interactions and system
  activities. Effective logging not only strengthens security posture but also aids
  in regulatory compliance by maintaining records that may be required during audits
  and assessments.
