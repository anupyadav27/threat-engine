title: Ensure Least Privilege Access for Watson ML Pipeline Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the principle of least privilege for Watson ML pipeline roles
  is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By restricting access to only those permissions necessary for users to perform their
  tasks, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and protect sensitive
  data. This approach not only enhances security but also supports compliance with
  regulatory requirements by ensuring that access is tightly controlled.
description: This security rule verifies that roles assigned within the Watson Machine
  Learning pipeline adhere to the principle of least privilege. It checks that users
  and service accounts are granted only the permissions essential for their operational
  needs. Implementing this rule helps in preventing privilege escalation attacks and
  unauthorized data manipulation, thereby safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality
  of machine learning workflows. By maintaining strict access controls, organizations
  can achieve improved security posture and alignment with industry best practices
  and compliance standards.
