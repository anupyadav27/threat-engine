title: Ensure AI Pipeline Encryption with IBM Key Management Service Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for AI pipelines in Watson Machine Learning using IBM
  Key Management Service (KMS) is crucial for protecting sensitive data at rest. This
  security measure mitigates the risk of unauthorized data access, ensuring compliance
  with regulatory standards and safeguarding organizational assets against data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that AI pipelines within the Watson Machine Learning
  service have encryption enabled using IBM Key Management Service. Enabling KMS encryption
  ensures that all data processed and stored within AI pipelines is encrypted at rest,
  enhancing data privacy and security. This practice not only aligns with data protection
  regulations but also supports best practices for encryption, reducing vulnerabilities
  and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Ensuring encryption at rest provides
  an additional layer of security, reinforcing the organization's commitment to data
  integrity and confidentiality.
