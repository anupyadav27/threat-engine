title: Minimal Role Assignment for Data Analytics in Watson ML Studio Groups
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring minimal role assignment within Watson ML Studio Groups is crucial
  for maintaining a secure environment. By limiting roles to only what is necessary,
  organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that roles assigned to data analytics groups
  within Watson ML Studio are kept to a minimum necessary level. By enforcing the
  principle of least privilege, the rule helps to prevent over-permissioning, which
  can lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation. Implementing minimal role
  assignments enhances security by ensuring that users have only the access needed
  to perform their tasks, thereby reducing the attack surface and aligning with compliance
  frameworks that mandate strict access controls.
