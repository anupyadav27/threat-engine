rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.studio_notebook.notebook_no_public_access
title: Restrict Public Access to IBM Watson Machine Learning Notebooks
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Watson Machine Learning Studio Notebooks are not publicly
  accessible is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
  data processed within these notebooks. Unauthorized public access can lead to data
  breaches, intellectual property theft, and compliance violations, which can significantly
  impact business operations and reputation.
description: This rule checks for configurations where IBM Watson Machine Learning
  Studio Notebooks are publicly accessible. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can safeguard their machine learning models and data by ensuring that only authorized
  users have access. This practice not only enhances the security posture by preventing
  unauthorized data exposure but also aids in meeting compliance requirements such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which demand strict access controls for personal and sensitive
  data.
