rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.data_asset.ai_services_dataset_access_logging_enabled
title: Ensure AI Services Dataset Access Logging is Enabled in Watson ML
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling access logging for AI services datasets in Watson Machine Learning
  is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security. It helps in tracking and
  auditing access patterns, identifying unauthorized access, and ensuring accountability,
  which is essential for meeting regulatory compliance and safeguarding sensitive
  data.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for dataset access within
  IBM Watson Machine Learning services. By ensuring that all access to datasets is
  logged, organizations can maintain a comprehensive audit trail, enhancing the ability
  to detect and respond to suspicious activities. This practice not only bolsters
  security by providing visibility into data access but also facilitates compliance
  with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require detailed records
  of data handling activities.
