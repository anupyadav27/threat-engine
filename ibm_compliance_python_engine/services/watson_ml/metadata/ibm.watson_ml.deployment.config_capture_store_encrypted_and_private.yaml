title: Ensure Encryption and Privacy for Watson ML Deployment Config Capture Store
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that configuration capture stores in Watson Machine Learning (ML)
  deployments are encrypted and private is crucial for protecting sensitive data from
  unauthorized access. Without encryption, sensitive information could be exposed,
  leading to potential data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can safeguard their data while maintaining
  trust and meeting regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks if the configuration capture store for Watson ML deployments
  is both encrypted and restricted to private access. Encryption at rest ensures that
  any data stored within the capture store is protected using cryptographic methods,
  making it unreadable to unauthorized users. By keeping the storage private, access
  is further restricted to only authorized entities. Implementing these measures not
  only enhances security but also aids in achieving compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure and
  legal repercussions.
