title: Enforce Private Subnets for Watson ML Studio Data Analytics
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that Watson Machine Learning Studio operates within private subnets
  is crucial for minimizing exposure to external threats. By restricting visibility
  to the internal network, the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches is significantly
  reduced, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining compliance with industry
  regulations.
description: This rule verifies that the subnets associated with the Watson Machine
  Learning Studio's Data Analytics Subnet Group are configured as private. By limiting
  access to the IBM Cloud private network, this configuration enhances security by
  preventing public internet exposure. This practice not only aligns with best practices
  for network security but also supports compliance with data protection standards
  by controlling access to critical resources and sensitive data.
