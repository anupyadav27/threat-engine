rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.model.package_not_publicly_shared
title: Ensure Watson ML Model Packages Are Not Publicly Shared
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Publicly sharing Watson Machine Learning model packages can expose sensitive
  data and proprietary algorithms to unauthorized access, leading to potential data
  breaches and intellectual property theft. Ensuring these packages are not publicly
  accessible protects the integrity of your AI-driven applications and maintains trust
  with stakeholders.
description: This rule checks whether Watson Machine Learning model packages are configured
  to be publicly accessible. By ensuring that model packages are not publicly shared,
  organizations can prevent unauthorized users from viewing or downloading sensitive
  models. This enhances security by enforcing strict access controls and aligns with
  best practices for data protection and compliance standards. Implementing this rule
  helps reduce the risk of data leakage and ensures that model access is restricted
  to authenticated and authorized users only.
