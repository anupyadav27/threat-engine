rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.config_content_type_whitelist_enforced
title: Enforce Content Type Whitelist for Watson ML Deployment Configurations
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing a content type whitelist for Watson Machine Learning deployments
  ensures that only approved and expected data formats are processed, mitigating the
  risk of ingesting malicious or malformed data. This practice is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity of machine learning models and preventing potential security breaches
  that could lead to data corruption or unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks whether a content type whitelist is enforced for Watson
  Machine Learning deployment configurations. By implementing this whitelist, organizations
  can restrict the types of data that can be processed by the deployment, thereby
  reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensuring that only validated content
  types are allowed. This measure not only enhances the security posture of the machine
  learning environment but also aligns with compliance requirements by demonstrating
  proactive security monitoring and governance.
