rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.deployment.endpoint_authn_required
title: Ensure Authentication for Watson ML Deployment Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Requiring authentication for Watson Machine Learning deployment endpoints
  is crucial to safeguard sensitive data and models from unauthorized access. Without
  proper authentication mechanisms, there is a risk of data breaches and unauthorized
  manipulations, which can have significant business implications, including loss
  of intellectual property and compromised data integrity.
description: This rule verifies that all Watson Machine Learning deployment endpoints
  have authentication mechanisms enabled. By enforcing endpoint authentication, the
  rule ensures that only authorized users can access deployed machine learning models
  and services, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Implementing this
  security measure helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data and models,
  aligning with compliance standards and best practices in network security and access
  control.
