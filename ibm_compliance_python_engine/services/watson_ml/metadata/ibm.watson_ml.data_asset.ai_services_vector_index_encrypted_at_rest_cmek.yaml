title: Ensure AI Services Vector Index is Encrypted at Rest Using CMEK
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting AI services vector index data at rest using Customer Managed
  Encryption Keys (CMEK) is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
  This ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and aligns
  with regulatory compliance standards, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches
  and enhancing customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that the vector index data associated with AI services
  in IBM Watson Machine Learning is encrypted at rest using Customer Managed Encryption
  Keys. By enforcing encryption at rest, the rule enhances data protection by ensuring
  that only authorized users with access to the encryption keys can access the underlying
  data. Implementing CMEK provides organizations with greater control over their encryption
  keys, enabling them to meet stringent compliance requirements like GDPR and HIPAA,
  and to effectively manage encryption policies within their cloud environment.
