title: Ensure VPC Configuration for Watson ML Training Jobs
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Configuring Watson Machine Learning training jobs to operate within a Virtual
  Private Cloud (VPC) enhances security by isolating network traffic and reducing
  exposure to external threats. This setup minimizes the risk of unauthorized access
  and data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive machine learning workloads and ensuring
  compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether Watson Machine Learning training jobs are configured
  to run within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). By enforcing VPC usage, it ensures
  that network traffic related to training jobs is restricted to a secure, isolated
  environment. This setup enhances security by preventing unauthorized external access
  and provides a controlled environment for sensitive data processing. Moreover, adherence
  to VPC configurations supports compliance with security frameworks that mandate
  strict network access controls.
