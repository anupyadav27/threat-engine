title: Ensure Audit Logging is Enabled for Watson ML Data Analytics Clusters
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Watson Machine Learning (ML) Data Analytics
  Clusters is crucial for tracking access and modifications to data, which helps in
  identifying unauthorized activities and potential security breaches. This practice
  not only enhances the security posture by providing a comprehensive trail of user
  activities but also supports compliance with regulatory standards that mandate logging
  and monitoring of data access.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for the Watson ML studio_cluster
  resource. By ensuring that audit logs are active, organizations can maintain a detailed
  record of events and actions taken within the data analytics environment, such as
  user logins, data queries, and configuration changes. This not only aids in quick
  detection and response to suspicious activities but also helps meet compliance requirements
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which demand stringent data access monitoring and logging.
  Enabling audit logging thereby reduces the risk of unnoticed data breaches and enhances
  the overall security framework of the IBM Cloud environment.
