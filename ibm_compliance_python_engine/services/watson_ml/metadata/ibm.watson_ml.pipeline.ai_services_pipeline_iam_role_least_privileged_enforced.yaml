title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Services Pipeline IAM Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for AI Services Pipeline
  IAM roles is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By ensuring that roles have only the permissions necessary to perform
  their designated functions, organizations can significantly reduce their attack
  surface and enhance overall security posture, leading to improved compliance with
  regulatory standards.
description: This rule ensures that IAM roles associated with Watson Machine Learning
  pipelines adhere to the principle of least privilege by only granting essential
  permissions required for pipeline operations. By checking that roles are not excessively
  privileged, this rule helps prevent misuse of access and limits potential damage
  from compromised accounts. Enforcing least privilege not only strengthens security
  by reducing access risks but also aligns with industry best practices and compliance
  requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access control measures.
