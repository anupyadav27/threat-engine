rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.ai_pipeline_logging_enabled
title: Ensure AI Pipeline Logging is Enabled for Watson Machine Learning
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for AI pipelines in Watson Machine Learning is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. It provides visibility
  into the operations and activities of AI models, helping to detect unauthorized
  access or anomalies. Logging also supports forensic investigations and compliance
  with regulatory requirements by ensuring that all actions within the AI pipelines
  are recorded and auditable.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for AI pipelines within the
  Watson Machine Learning service. By ensuring that logging is active, organizations
  can monitor the execution and behavior of their AI models, capturing critical data
  on model performance and access patterns. This enhances security by providing a
  trail of activities that can be analyzed to detect and respond to potential threats.
  Moreover, it supports compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate
  audit trails and monitoring, such as GDPR and HIPAA, thus reducing the risk of data
  breaches and non-compliance penalties.
