title: Ensure SBOM Presence for AI Model Artifacts in Watson ML
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: The inclusion of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for AI model artifacts
  is crucial for maintaining transparency and traceability in the software supply
  chain. It allows organizations to identify and manage potential vulnerabilities,
  ensuring the integrity and security of AI services. Failing to maintain an SBOM
  could lead to undetected exposure to security risks and non-compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This rule verifies the presence of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
  for AI model artifacts within IBM Watson Machine Learning. By ensuring that all
  model artifacts have an SBOM, organizations can track the components and dependencies
  involved, facilitating better vulnerability management and compliance with regulatory
  requirements. An SBOM provides a detailed inventory of software components, which
  is essential for identifying security vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity
  of AI models. This enhances the overall security posture by enabling proactive threat
  detection and mitigation strategies.
