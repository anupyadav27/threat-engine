title: Ensure Row-Level Security is Enabled for Watson ML Data Sets
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling row-level security for data analytics datasets in Watson Machine
  Learning (ML) is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. This
  security measure ensures that users can only access the data they are authorized
  to see, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure and aligning with privacy
  regulations. Implementing this control helps organizations protect sensitive information
  and maintain compliance with data protection standards.
description: This rule verifies that row-level security is enabled for datasets used
  within Watson ML's Studio environment. By enforcing row-level security, organizations
  can restrict data access based on user roles, ensuring that sensitive information
  is only available to authorized users. This practice not only enhances data protection
  but also supports compliance with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA, which
  require robust data access controls. Enabling this feature mitigates the risk of
  data breaches and unauthorized access, thereby strengthening the overall security
  posture of the data analytics environment.
