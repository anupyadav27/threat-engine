title: Enforce Least Privilege for Watson AI Notebook Execution Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for AI notebook execution
  roles minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By
  ensuring that roles have only the necessary permissions, organizations can effectively
  reduce their attack surface and protect sensitive data and resources, maintaining
  trust and compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks that AI notebook execution roles in Watson Machine Learning
  are configured with the least privilege necessary to perform their functions. By
  verifying and enforcing this configuration, organizations can limit exposure to
  potential security threats and unauthorized access. This practice not only enhances
  overall security posture but also aligns with compliance standards such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, ensuring that data privacy and integrity are maintained.
