title: Ensure AI HPO Logs Are Enabled for Watson ML Training
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling AI Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) logs for Watson Machine Learning
  (ML) training is crucial for maintaining an audit trail of model training activities.
  This logging capability helps detect anomalies, ensure accountability, and facilitates
  root cause analysis in case of security incidents. Moreover, it supports compliance
  with industry regulations that require detailed record-keeping of data processing
  activities.
description: This rule checks whether AI HPO logs are enabled for Watson ML training
  activities. By ensuring that these logs are active, organizations can monitor the
  hyperparameter optimization process, capturing detailed records of configurations
  and outcomes. This enhances the security posture by enabling the detection of unauthorized
  changes or anomalies in the training process. Furthermore, it aids in achieving
  compliance with regulatory standards that mandate comprehensive audit trails. Enabling
  HPO logs also supports proactive monitoring and continuous improvement of machine
  learning models by providing insights into the optimization process.
