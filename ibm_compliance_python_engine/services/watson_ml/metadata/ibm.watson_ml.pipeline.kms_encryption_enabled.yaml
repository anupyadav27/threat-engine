rule_id: ibm.watson_ml.pipeline.kms_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for Watson ML Pipelines
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for Watson Machine Learning
  (ML) pipelines is critical for safeguarding sensitive data at rest. Without encryption,
  unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, compromising intellectual property
  and regulatory compliance. This measure helps mitigate risks associated with data
  theft and ensures adherence to data protection laws, thereby maintaining customer
  trust and business integrity.
description: This rule verifies that all Watson ML pipelines have KMS encryption enabled,
  ensuring that data at rest is encrypted using IBM Key Protect or a similar service.
  By implementing this rule, organizations can enhance their data protection strategy
  by securing sensitive machine learning data against unauthorized access. Enabling
  KMS encryption not only fortifies data confidentiality and integrity but also aligns
  with compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate robust data protection
  mechanisms.
