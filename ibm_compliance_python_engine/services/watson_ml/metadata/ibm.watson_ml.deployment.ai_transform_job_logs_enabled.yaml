title: Ensure AI Transform Job Logs are Enabled for Watson ML Deployments
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling AI Transform Job Logs in Watson Machine Learning deployments is
  crucial for maintaining robust security and compliance standards. These logs provide
  a detailed record of operations and activities, which can be invaluable for troubleshooting,
  performance tuning, and forensic investigations in case of security incidents. Moreover,
  comprehensive logging aids in compliance with industry regulations and internal
  policies by documenting access and actions taken within the AI models.
description: This rule checks whether AI Transform Job Logs are enabled for Watson
  Machine Learning deployments. By ensuring that logging is active, organizations
  can monitor the execution of AI transformation jobs, capturing important data such
  as job status, errors, and operational metrics. This enhances security by providing
  visibility into the deployment environment and assists in the detection and prevention
  of unauthorized activities. Additionally, maintaining logs supports compliance efforts
  by creating an audit trail that demonstrates adherence to security policies and
  regulatory requirements.
