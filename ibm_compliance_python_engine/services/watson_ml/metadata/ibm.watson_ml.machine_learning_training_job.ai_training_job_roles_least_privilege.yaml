title: Enforce Least Privilege for AI Training Job Roles in Watson ML
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for AI training job roles
  in Watson Machine Learning minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By restricting access rights to only those necessary for specific
  tasks, organizations can protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of their
  AI models, which is crucial for maintaining customer trust and meeting regulatory
  compliance.
description: This rule ensures that roles associated with machine learning training
  jobs in IBM Watson ML are configured to follow the principle of least privilege.
  It checks that access permissions are limited to the minimum required for specific
  job functions, thereby reducing the attack surface by preventing excessive permissions
  that could be exploited by malicious actors. By enforcing least privilege, this
  rule not only enhances the security posture of the Watson ML environment but also
  aligns with best practices in identity and access management, aiding in achieving
  compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
