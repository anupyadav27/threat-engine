title: Restrict Cross-Account Sharing of Watson ML Model Registry
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of Watson Machine Learning (ML) model
  registries is crucial for maintaining data privacy and minimizing unauthorized access
  risks. Uncontrolled sharing can lead to data breaches and compliance violations,
  impacting business integrity and client trust. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can ensure only authorized parties access sensitive AI models, aligning with best
  practices in data protection.
description: This rule checks for configurations that allow cross-account sharing
  of Watson ML model registries, ensuring they are restricted to prevent unauthorized
  access. By limiting sharing capabilities, the rule enhances security by controlling
  who can view or modify AI models, which are often built on proprietary or sensitive
  data. Implementing this rule supports compliance with regulatory standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict data access controls. Adhering to this rule
  not only fortifies the organization's security posture but also protects intellectual
  property and sensitive information from potential exposure.
