rule_id: ibm.dns.resource_record.record_set_no_rfc1918_in_public_zones
title: Prevent RFC1918 Addresses in Public DNS Zones for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Exposing RFC1918 private IP addresses in public DNS zones can lead to inadvertent
  data exposure and unauthorized access, as these addresses are meant for internal
  network use only. Ensuring that internal IP addresses are not publicly accessible
  helps protect sensitive resources and maintains the integrity of network boundaries,
  thereby reducing the risk of potential breaches and data leaks.
description: This rule checks that no DNS record sets in public DNS zones contain
  RFC1918 private IP addresses, which are reserved for internal use according to the
  standards specified in RFC1918. By enforcing this rule, organizations ensure that
  their private network configurations are not unintentionally exposed to the public
  internet, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. Compliance
  with this rule supports best practices in network segmentation and data security,
  aligning with regulatory requirements and enhancing overall security posture.
