rule_id: ibm.dns.zone.zone_transfer_restricted_or_tsig_required
title: Ensure DNS Zone Transfers are Restricted or TSIG-Secured
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting DNS zone transfers is crucial to prevent unauthorized access
  to DNS data, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information and facilitate
  attacks on your infrastructure. Implementing Transfer Secret Key (TSIG) provides
  an additional layer of cryptographic authentication, ensuring that only authorized
  servers can initiate zone transfers, thereby mitigating the risk of data leakage
  and enhancing the overall security posture.
description: This rule checks whether DNS zone transfers on IBM Cloud are either restricted
  to specific IP addresses or secured using TSIG. By enforcing these security measures,
  organizations can prevent unauthorized entities from accessing the DNS zone information,
  which could be used to map network topology or identify potential targets for further
  attacks. Compliance with this rule aids in adhering to best practices and regulatory
  requirements for protecting DNS infrastructures, thereby contributing to a robust
  security and governance framework.
