title: Ensure DNSSEC Key is Enabled for DNS Security and Integrity
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is critical for preventing
  DNS cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks, which could lead to unauthorized
  data access or service disruptions. By ensuring DNS records are cryptographically
  signed, organizations can maintain trust and integrity in their DNS infrastructure,
  thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are enabled
  for DNS zones within IBM Cloud by checking if the DNSSEC keys are actively signing
  the DNS records. Enabling DNSSEC ensures that DNS responses are authenticated and
  have not been tampered with in transit, thereby preventing malicious activities
  like spoofing and cache poisoning. This practice enhances the overall security posture
  by ensuring data integrity and supporting compliance with industry standards such
  as ISO/IEC 27001 and GDPR, which require robust data protection measures.
