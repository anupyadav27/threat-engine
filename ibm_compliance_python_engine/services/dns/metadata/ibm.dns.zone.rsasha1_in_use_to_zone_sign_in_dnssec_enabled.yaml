title: Ensure RSA-SHA1 Is Not Used for DNSSEC Zone Signing
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: The use of RSA-SHA1 for DNSSEC zone signing poses security risks due to
  its vulnerability to cryptographic attacks, potentially compromising the integrity
  and authenticity of DNS data. Employing stronger algorithms like RSA-SHA256 or RSA-SHA512
  enhances security by ensuring robust protection against these vulnerabilities. Transitioning
  to more secure algorithms helps maintain trust in DNS operations and aligns with
  industry best practices, safeguarding business operations from potential disruptions
  or data breaches.
description: This rule checks for the use of RSA-SHA1 in DNSSEC zone signing configurations
  within the IBM Cloud DNS service. RSA-SHA1, considered weak by current cryptographic
  standards, should be phased out in favor of stronger algorithms such as RSA-SHA256
  or RSA-SHA512. By ensuring that DNSSEC is configured with robust algorithms, organizations
  can prevent potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers
  to manipulate DNS records. This practice not only enhances the security posture
  of the DNS infrastructure but also supports compliance with regulatory and industry
  standards that mandate the use of strong cryptographic methods.
