rule_id: ibm.dns.resource.public_hosted_zones_monitoring_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Public Hosted Zones Have Monitoring and Logging Enabled
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling monitoring and logging for public hosted zones is crucial for
  identifying and responding to potential security threats, unauthorized access, or
  configuration changes in real-time. This practice helps organizations maintain visibility
  into DNS activities, thereby mitigating risks and ensuring the integrity and availability
  of DNS services, which are vital for business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that monitoring and logging are enabled for public
  hosted zones within the IBM Cloud DNS service. By ensuring that audit logs are active,
  organizations can track all DNS queries and changes, enabling quick detection of
  suspicious activities or policy violations. This improves the organization's security
  posture by providing the necessary audit trails for compliance with industry standards
  and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, and assists in forensic investigations.
