rule_id: ibm.dns.resource_record.record_set_no_..._sensitive_zones
title: Ensure DNS Records Avoid Usage in Sensitive Zones
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Preventing DNS records from being used in sensitive zones is crucial for
  minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Sensitive zones
  often contain critical infrastructure and data; thus, misconfigurations or malicious
  entries can lead to significant security breaches, impacting business operations
  and causing compliance violations.
description: This rule checks that DNS resource record sets are not inadvertently
  or intentionally linked to sensitive zones, which are areas requiring enhanced confidentiality
  and integrity measures. By implementing this control, organizations can enforce
  stricter security policies, reduce the risk of data leakage, and ensure adherence
  to compliance standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA. It also aids in maintaining a robust
  security posture by ensuring that only authorized DNS records are associated with
  critical resources.
