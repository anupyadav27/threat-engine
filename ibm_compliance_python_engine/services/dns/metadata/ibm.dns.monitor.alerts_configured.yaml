rule_id: ibm.dns.monitor.alerts_configured
title: Ensure DNS Monitors Have Alerts Configured for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alerts for DNS monitors is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and availability of DNS services. Timely alerts enable administrators to respond
  quickly to potential disruptions or malicious activities that could compromise service
  reliability or lead to data breaches. This proactive approach minimizes downtime
  and protects business reputation by ensuring continuous service availability.
description: This rule checks whether alerts are configured for DNS monitors within
  IBM Cloud. Proper alert configuration ensures that any deviations from expected
  DNS behavior are promptly reported to administrators, facilitating immediate investigation
  and response. By implementing these alerts, organizations can improve their security
  posture by detecting and reacting to anomalies or threats in real-time. This practice
  supports compliance with industry standards and regulations by maintaining rigorous
  logging and monitoring of DNS activities, which is essential for auditing and forensic
  analysis.
