rule_id: ibm.dns.zone.cross_account_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict Cross-Account DNS Zone Sharing for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting cross-account sharing of DNS zones is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. By ensuring that DNS zones are only shared within
  trusted accounts, organizations mitigate the risk of malicious actors exploiting
  DNS configurations to redirect traffic or conduct phishing attacks, thus safeguarding
  business reputation and continuity.
description: This rule verifies that DNS zones within the IBM Cloud are not shared
  across multiple accounts unless explicitly authorized. By enforcing this restriction,
  the rule enhances security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and modification
  of DNS records. It ensures compliance with best practices in security governance,
  promoting a robust security posture by limiting exposure to only necessary and vetted
  entities, thereby reducing the attack surface.
