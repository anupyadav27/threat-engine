rule_id: ibm.dns.policy.traffic_health_checks_required_for_failover
title: Mandatory Traffic Health Checks for DNS Failover Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing traffic health checks in DNS failover policies ensures that traffic
  is routed only to operational resources, minimizing downtime and preventing potential
  service disruptions. This practice enhances system reliability and availability,
  critical for maintaining business continuity and safeguarding the customer experience
  against failures.
description: This rule mandates that all DNS failover policies implement traffic health
  checks to verify the availability and performance of resources before redirecting
  traffic. By continuously monitoring resource health, the system can proactively
  switch traffic to backup servers, thereby preventing outages and ensuring seamless
  service delivery. Implementing such checks supports compliance with industry best
  practices for high availability and disaster recovery, ensuring adherence to regulatory
  standards and enhancing overall security posture.
