rule_id: ibm.dns.resource_record.record_set_caa_records_present_for_root_and_wildcard
title: Ensure CAA Records for Root and Wildcard DNS Entries
severity: critical
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: This rule is crucial for enhancing DNS security by ensuring that only authorized
  certificate authorities can issue SSL/TLS certificates for your domain. The presence
  of CAA records mitigates the risk of certificate mis-issuance, which could lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, and a loss of customer trust.
description: The rule checks for the presence of Certification Authority Authorization
  (CAA) records in DNS configurations for both root and wildcard domains. CAA records
  specify which certificate authorities are permitted to issue certificates for the
  domain, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized certificate issuance. Implementing
  this rule supports compliance with industry standards and best practices, such as
  the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements, enhancing your organization's security
  posture and governance.
