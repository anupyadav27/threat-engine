rule_id: ibm.dns.zone.query_logging_enabled
title: Ensure DNS Zone Query Logging is Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling query logging for DNS zones is crucial for tracking and analyzing
  DNS queries, which can help identify potential security threats and unauthorized
  access attempts. It provides visibility into DNS traffic patterns, aiding in the
  detection of anomalies and malicious activities, thereby protecting the integrity
  and availability of your network infrastructure.
description: This security rule verifies that query logging is enabled for DNS zones
  within the IBM Cloud environment. Enabling query logging allows administrators to
  capture detailed records of DNS queries, which are essential for auditing and forensic
  investigations. This practice not only enhances security by providing insights into
  potential security incidents but also supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  by maintaining comprehensive DNS activity logs.
