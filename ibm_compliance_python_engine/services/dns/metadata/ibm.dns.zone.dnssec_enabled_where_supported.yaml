rule_id: ibm.dns.zone.dnssec_enabled_where_supported
title: Ensure DNSSEC is Enabled for DNS Zones Where Supported
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is crucial for protecting DNS
  infrastructure against various cyber threats, such as cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. By ensuring DNSSEC is enabled, organizations can enhance the trust and
  integrity of their DNS data, reducing the risk of domain hijacking and other security
  vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches and financial loss.
description: This security rule checks whether DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is
  enabled for DNS zones where it is supported. DNSSEC adds a layer of security to
  the Domain Name System by providing authentication of DNS data and integrity verification.
  Implementing DNSSEC helps organizations comply with regulatory standards that mandate
  secure DNS practices and ensures a robust security posture by mitigating risks associated
  with DNS attacks. This practice not only fortifies the organization's cybersecurity
  defenses but also assures clients and stakeholders of the integrity and authenticity
  of their DNS information.
