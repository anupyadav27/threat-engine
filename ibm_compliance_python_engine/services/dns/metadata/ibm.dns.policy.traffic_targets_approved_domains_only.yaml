rule_id: ibm.dns.policy.traffic_targets_approved_domains_only
title: Enforce DNS Traffic to Approved Domains Only
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Restricting DNS traffic to approved domains ensures that data is directed
  to known, secure endpoints, significantly reducing the risk of data exfiltration
  and exposure to malicious domains. This policy helps maintain the integrity of DNS
  queries by preventing unauthorized access, which is vital for protecting sensitive
  information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that DNS policies are configured to allow traffic
  only to a predefined list of approved domains. By implementing this control, organizations
  can prevent potentially harmful redirections to unauthorized or malicious domains,
  thus enhancing the overall security posture. This measure is crucial for compliance
  with industry standards and regulations that mandate strict access controls and
  protection of data in transit. Ensuring DNS traffic is restricted to approved domains
  minimizes the risk of data breaches and supports secure communication across cloud
  services.
