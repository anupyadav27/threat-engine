rule_id: ibm.dns.zone.dnssec_disabled
title: Ensure DNSSEC is Disabled for DNS Zones to Prevent Misconfiguration
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Disabling DNSSEC for DNS zones is crucial when the specific environment
  does not support or require it, as improper configuration can lead to service disruptions
  or vulnerabilities. Ensuring DNSSEC is disabled in such cases minimizes the risk
  of misconfigurations that could expose DNS infrastructure to attacks such as DNS
  spoofing or amplification attacks, thereby maintaining operational stability and
  security.
description: This rule checks whether DNSSEC is disabled for DNS zones within IBM
  Cloud environments. DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to DNS which adds security to
  the DNS protocol by enabling cryptographic signatures. However, in environments
  where DNSSEC is not properly supported or configured, it can inadvertently introduce
  vulnerabilities or service disruptions. By ensuring DNSSEC is disabled, organizations
  can avoid these risks, thus enhancing the security posture and ensuring compliance
  with policies that require DNS integrity and availability.
