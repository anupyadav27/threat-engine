rule_id: ibm.dns.policy.traffic_policy_documents_encrypted_and_private
title: Enforce Encryption and Privacy for DNS Traffic Policy Documents
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that DNS traffic policy documents are encrypted and private is
  crucial for protecting sensitive configuration data from unauthorized access and
  potential tampering. Encrypting these documents helps maintain data confidentiality
  and integrity, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data
  protection regulations.
description: This rule mandates that all DNS traffic policy documents within the IBM
  Cloud are encrypted at rest, guaranteeing that sensitive information is safeguarded
  against unauthorized access. By enforcing encryption, this rule ensures that only
  authorized users can access and modify policy documents, thereby enhancing overall
  security posture. Compliance with this rule aligns with best practices in data protection
  and privacy, supporting adherence to industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which often require encryption of sensitive data.
