rule_id: ibm.dns.resource_record.record_set_alias_targets_in_approved_services
title: Ensure Record Set Alias Targets Are Within Approved Services
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: This rule is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of DNS
  configurations by ensuring that alias targets are restricted to approved services.
  This minimizes the risk of misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access
  or data leakage, thereby protecting sensitive data and ensuring service reliability.
  Adhering to this rule supports compliance with industry standards and organizational
  policies, reducing potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This security rule checks whether DNS resource record sets with alias
  targets are restricted to a predefined list of approved services. By enforcing this
  control, organizations can prevent the misuse of DNS records that could otherwise
  redirect traffic to unauthorized or malicious endpoints. Implementing this rule
  helps enhance the security posture by ensuring that DNS configurations align with
  organizational policies and best practices. It also aids in compliance with regulatory
  requirements by demonstrating adherence to standardized governance frameworks.
