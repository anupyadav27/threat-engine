rule_id: ibm.dns.monitor.no_plaintext_credentials_in_url
title: Ensure No Plaintext Credentials in DNS Monitor URLs
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Storing plaintext credentials in URLs can lead to unauthorized access if
  URLs are logged or intercepted. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to data
  confidentiality and integrity, leading to potential security breaches, financial
  losses, and reputational damage. Adhering to secure credential management practices
  is essential for maintaining robust access controls and protecting sensitive information.
description: This security rule checks DNS monitor configurations to ensure that credentials
  are not embedded in URLs in plaintext form. By preventing credentials from being
  exposed in URLs, it reduces the risk of credential leakage through logs or network
  traffic interception. Securing credentials enhances the overall security posture
  and aligns with compliance requirements for protecting sensitive information. Implementing
  this rule helps organizations adhere to best practices in authentication and access
  management within the IBM Cloud environment.
