rule_id: ibm.dns.monitor.https_or_tls_used
title: Ensure DNS Monitors Use HTTPS or TLS for Secure Data Transmission
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Utilizing HTTPS or TLS for DNS monitors is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data as it traverses the network. This encryption safeguards against eavesdropping
  and man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the
  data being monitored. Failing to encrypt this data could lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches, thereby compromising the organization's security posture
  and trust.
description: This security rule verifies that all DNS monitors within IBM Cloud are
  configured to use HTTPS or TLS protocols for secure communication. By enforcing
  this practice, organizations can protect data in transit from interception and tampering,
  thus enhancing overall data protection and privacy. Compliance with this rule aligns
  with industry standards and regulatory requirements for encryption at rest, providing
  a robust mechanism for ensuring that sensitive information remains secure as it
  flows through cloud services.
