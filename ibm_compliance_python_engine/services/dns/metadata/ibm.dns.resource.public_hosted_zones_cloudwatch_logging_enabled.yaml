rule_id: ibm.dns.resource.public_hosted_zones_cloudwatch_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Cloudwatch Logging is Enabled for Public DNS Hosted Zones
severity: critical
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Cloudwatch logging for public DNS hosted zones is essential for
  maintaining visibility into DNS query activities, which is crucial for detecting
  potential security incidents, such as DNS-based attacks. This logging capability
  provides valuable insights that can aid in forensic investigations and enhance incident
  response efforts, thereby protecting the business from disruptions and data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that Cloudwatch logging is enabled for public hosted
  zones in the IBM Cloud DNS service. By ensuring Cloudwatch logging is active, organizations
  can monitor and audit DNS queries, which helps in identifying unauthorized access
  attempts and misconfigurations. This practice not only strengthens the security
  posture by offering real-time logging and monitoring but also supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations that mandate logging and monitoring of network
  activities.
