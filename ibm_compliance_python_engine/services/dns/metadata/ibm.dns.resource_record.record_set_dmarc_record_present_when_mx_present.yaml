title: Ensure DMARC Record Exists for Domains with MX Records
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: The presence of a DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
  and Conformance) record is crucial for domains with MX (Mail Exchange) records as
  it helps mitigate email spoofing and phishing attacks. By enforcing DMARC policies,
  organizations can protect their domain's reputation and ensure that email communications
  are secure and authenticated, reducing the risk of malicious actors exploiting their
  domains for fraudulent purposes.
description: This rule checks for the existence of a DMARC record in DNS configurations
  for domains with MX records. The DMARC record is essential for defining policies
  that help authenticate email sources and report unauthorized usage. Implementing
  a DMARC record improves security by ensuring emails sent from the domain are legitimate
  and comply with specified policies, thus safeguarding against phishing attacks.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with email security standards and governance
  policies, providing a reliable method for monitoring and responding to potential
  email threats.
