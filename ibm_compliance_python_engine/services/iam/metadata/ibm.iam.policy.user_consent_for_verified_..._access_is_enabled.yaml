title: Ensure User Consent for Verified Access is Enabled in IAM Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing user consent for verified access is crucial in maintaining robust
  security and privacy standards. It ensures that users are aware of and agree to
  the permissions granted, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This practice aligns with compliance requirements and enhances trust
  by safeguarding sensitive information.
description: This security rule checks whether user consent for verified access is
  enabled within IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Enabling
  this feature requires explicit user acknowledgment before access to resources is
  granted, thereby ensuring that users are fully informed about the permissions they
  are consenting to. This proactive measure enhances security by preventing inadvertent
  or malicious access, and it aids in demonstrating compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA by ensuring user awareness and authorization.
