title: Configure Tenant Inactive User Disable Threshold for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring the inactive user disable threshold is crucial for minimizing
  security risks associated with dormant accounts, which can be exploited by malicious
  actors. Ensuring this threshold is set helps organizations maintain a robust security
  posture by automatically disabling accounts after a period of inactivity, reducing
  the potential for unauthorized access and data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether the tenant has configured the inactive user
  disable threshold in their IBM Cloud account settings. By enabling this configuration,
  organizations can automatically deactivate user accounts that have been inactive
  beyond a specified period, thereby reducing the attack surface. This practice is
  aligned with security best practices and compliance standards, as it prevents unauthorized
  access through dormant or forgotten accounts. It enhances overall security by ensuring
  that only active, managed users have access to the cloud resources.
