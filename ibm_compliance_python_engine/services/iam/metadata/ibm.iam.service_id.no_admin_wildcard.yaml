rule_id: ibm.iam.service_id.no_admin_wildcard
title: Prevent Admin Wildcard Permissions for Service IDs in IBM IAM
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that Service IDs do not possess admin wildcard permissions is
  critical for minimizing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
  Granting such broad permissions can lead to potential security breaches, where malicious
  actors could exploit these credentials to gain unfettered access to sensitive data
  and resources. Limiting privileges to the least necessary for operation helps maintain
  strict access control, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality of cloud
  resources.
description: This rule checks for the presence of wildcard (*) admin permissions in
  Service IDs within the IBM Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. Service
  IDs should be configured with the principle of least privilege, granting only the
  permissions strictly necessary for their function. By avoiding wildcard permissions,
  organizations can reduce their attack surface and meet compliance requirements by
  ensuring that service accounts do not have unnecessary high-level access to cloud
  resources. This approach aligns with best practices in cloud security and governance,
  helping to safeguard against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
