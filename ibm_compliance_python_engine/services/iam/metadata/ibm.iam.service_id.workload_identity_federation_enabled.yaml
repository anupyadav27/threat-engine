title: Ensure Workload Identity Federation is Enabled for Service IDs
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Workload Identity Federation for Service IDs strengthens security
  by allowing external identities to access IBM Cloud services without managing long-lived
  credentials. This reduces the risk of credential exposure and enhances the scalability
  and flexibility of access management. It also supports compliance with best practices
  for secure authentication and access control.
description: This rule verifies that Workload Identity Federation is enabled for Service
  IDs within IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). By enabling this feature,
  organizations can configure federated access for workloads running outside IBM Cloud,
  such as on-premises or other cloud environments, using external identity providers.
  This approach minimizes the need to distribute and manage static credentials, thus
  lowering the risk of unauthorized access. Ensuring Workload Identity Federation
  is enabled aligns with security best practices for authentication and supports compliance
  with regulatory standards that emphasize secure identity management and access controls.
