title: Ensure MFA for Entra Privileged Users in IBM IAM
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged users is crucial in protecting
  sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access. Implementing MFA reduces the
  risk of credential theft and strengthens the security posture by requiring an additional
  verification step, thus safeguarding critical assets from cyber threats and ensuring
  business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that all Entra privileged users within the IBM Cloud
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) service have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  enabled. By enforcing MFA for users with elevated permissions, organizations can
  ensure that access to critical resources is tightly controlled and verified, significantly
  reducing the attack surface for potential breaches. Complying with this rule not
  only enhances security but also aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  for authentication and access control, thereby aiding in compliance efforts.
