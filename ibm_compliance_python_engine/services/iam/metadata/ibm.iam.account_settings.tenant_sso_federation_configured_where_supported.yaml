title: Ensure Tenant SSO Federation is Configured in IBM Cloud Accounts
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) Federation in IBM Cloud accounts enhances
  security by centralizing the authentication process and reducing the risk of credential
  compromise across multiple applications. It also simplifies access management, improving
  compliance with identity and access management policies while reducing administrative
  overhead.
description: This rule checks that Single Sign-On (SSO) Federation is configured for
  IBM Cloud account settings where it is supported. Enabling SSO Federation allows
  users to authenticate using a centralized identity provider, enhancing security
  by minimizing the use of multiple credentials and reducing the potential attack
  surface. It supports seamless integration with existing identity management systems,
  thereby ensuring compliance with organizational security policies and regulatory
  standards. By leveraging SSO, organizations can streamline user access management,
  thus aligning with best practices for identity and access management.
