title: Enforce Prohibition of Inline Policies in IAM Access Groups
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Inline policies within IAM access groups can lead to complex security configurations
  that are difficult to audit and manage. By prohibiting inline policies, organizations
  can ensure a more standardized and centralized approach to policy management, reducing
  the risk of inadvertent privilege escalation and non-compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline policies within IBM Cloud
  IAM access groups and flags any instances where they exist. Inline policies are
  discouraged because they can create fragmented and inconsistent access control strategies,
  making it challenging to enforce uniform security policies across your cloud environment.
  By ensuring that all policies are managed centrally, organizations enhance their
  ability to maintain strong security postures and meet regulatory requirements by
  simplifying audits and policy updates.
