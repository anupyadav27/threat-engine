severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring organization essential contacts in IBM Cloud IAM is crucial
  for effective incident response and communication during security events. It ensures
  that the right individuals are notified promptly, minimizing response time and potential
  damage. Additionally, having up-to-date contact information supports regulatory
  compliance requirements for incident management and reporting.
description: This rule verifies that essential contacts for the organization are configured
  within IBM Cloud IAM account settings. By ensuring these contacts are up-to-date,
  organizations can enhance their security posture by facilitating rapid communication
  during incidents, thereby improving response times. This setup also aids in meeting
  compliance obligations by ensuring that security notifications are sent to designated
  personnel, thus maintaining the integrity and security of the cloud environment.
