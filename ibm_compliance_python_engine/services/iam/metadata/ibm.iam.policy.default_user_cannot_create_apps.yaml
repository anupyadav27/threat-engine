rule_id: ibm.iam.policy.default_user_cannot_create_apps
title: Restrict Default User Permissions to Prevent Unauthorized App Creation
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Restricting default users from creating applications is crucial for maintaining
  a controlled and secure environment within the IBM Cloud. This rule minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized application deployment, which could lead to potential security
  breaches and resource misuse. By enforcing this policy, organizations can ensure
  that only authorized and knowledgeable personnel can manage application deployment,
  thereby aligning with best practices for identity and access management.
description: This rule checks that default user roles do not have permissions to create
  applications within IBM Cloud. By limiting application creation capabilities, it
  reduces the attack surface and mitigates risks associated with unauthorized or accidental
  deployment of applications that may not adhere to security policies. Implementing
  this restriction enhances security posture by ensuring that only vetted users with
  the necessary privileges and understanding of compliance requirements can perform
  such actions. This aligns with compliance frameworks by enforcing least privilege
  access and maintaining strict control over application deployment processes.
