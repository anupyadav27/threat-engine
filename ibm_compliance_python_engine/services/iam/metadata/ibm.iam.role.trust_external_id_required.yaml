title: Enforce Trust External ID for Secure Role Assumption in IBM IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the use of a Trust External ID in role assumption helps prevent
  unauthorized access by ensuring that only trusted entities can assume roles. This
  requirement mitigates the risk of misuse of roles by external entities, protecting
  sensitive resources and data. It enhances the security posture by adding an additional
  layer of verification, thus ensuring compliance with best practices in identity
  and access management.
description: This rule checks whether an External ID is required when a role is assumed
  in IBM Cloud IAM. By enforcing the use of a Trust External ID, it ensures that role
  assumptions are validated against a specific identifier known only to trusted entities.
  This practice prevents unauthorized role assumption, reducing the risk of privilege
  escalation and unauthorized access. The rule aligns with compliance standards that
  mandate strict access controls and enhances the overall security framework by ensuring
  that roles are not exploited by malicious actors. Implementing this rule also supports
  adherence to industry regulations and internal security policies.
