title: Enforce Constraints on RBAC Allow Policies to Prevent Unrestricted Access
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that RBAC policies are constrained is essential to prevent unauthorized
  access to resources. Without constraints, policies could inadvertently grant excessive
  permissions, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with security
  standards. By enforcing constraints, organizations can maintain a principle of least
  privilege, reducing the risk of insider threats and external attacks.
description: This rule checks IAM policies to ensure that any RBAC allow policies
  include appropriate constraints. By verifying the presence of constraints, the rule
  helps prevent overly permissive access, which could lead to unauthorized operations
  on critical resources. Implementing this rule enhances security by aligning access
  permissions with business requirements and compliance mandates, ensuring that users
  can only perform actions they are explicitly authorized to carry out.
