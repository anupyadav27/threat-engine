title: Enforce MFA with RADIUS for Enhanced IAM Security
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using RADIUS for IAM resources
  is crucial for strengthening security posture by adding an additional layer of authentication.
  This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, safeguarding sensitive information
  and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks whether Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via RADIUS
  is enabled for IAM resources within IBM Cloud. By enforcing RADIUS-based MFA, organizations
  benefit from centralized authentication management, improving security through more
  robust identity verification processes. This helps mitigate risks associated with
  credential theft and unauthorized access, while also ensuring adherence to compliance
  frameworks that mandate strong authentication mechanisms.
