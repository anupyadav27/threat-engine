title: Enforce MFA for IBM Cloud Tenant Break Glass Accounts
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Tenant Break Glass Accounts
  is crucial to bolster security by adding an additional layer of verification, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access. Break glass accounts are critical for emergency
  access and must be protected to prevent potential data breaches, ensuring the resilience
  and integrity of your IBM Cloud environment.
description: This rule verifies that MFA is enforced for all Tenant Break Glass Accounts
  within IBM Cloud IAM account settings. By requiring MFA, organizations can ensure
  that these high-privilege emergency accounts are not vulnerable to attacks that
  exploit single-factor authentication weaknesses. Implementing this control helps
  adhere to industry best practices and compliance standards, such as GDPR and NIST,
  by ensuring that access to sensitive resources is tightly controlled and monitored.
