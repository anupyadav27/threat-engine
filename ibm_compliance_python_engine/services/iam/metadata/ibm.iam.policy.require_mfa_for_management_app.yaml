title: Enforce MFA for Management Application Access in IBM IAM Policies
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing management applications
  is crucial for strengthening security against unauthorized access. By adding an
  additional layer of verification, it mitigates the risk of credential theft and
  reduces potential business impacts, such as data breaches and unauthorized modifications
  to cloud resources.
description: This rule mandates the implementation of MFA for any user accessing management
  applications within IBM Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy framework.
  It evaluates whether MFA is enforced, ensuring only authenticated and verified users
  can perform management operations. The rule enhances security by reducing the attack
  surface and aligns with compliance standards such as NIST and ISO, which advocate
  for strong authentication measures to protect sensitive data and resources.
