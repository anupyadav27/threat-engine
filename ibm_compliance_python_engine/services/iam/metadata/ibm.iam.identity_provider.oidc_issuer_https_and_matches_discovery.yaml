title: Enforce HTTPS and Discovery Match for OIDC Issuers in IBM IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that the OIDC Issuer URL uses HTTPS and matches the discovery
  document is crucial for secure identity and access management. It prevents man-in-the-middle
  attacks, ensures data integrity, and maintains trust in authentication processes.
  Non-compliance could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise
  of sensitive information, potentially resulting in significant financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule checks that the OpenID Connect (OIDC) Issuer URL for an identity
  provider within IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses HTTPS and matches
  the discovery document. HTTPS ensures encrypted communication between clients and
  the identity provider, protecting against interception and tampering. Additionally,
  matching the issuer with the discovery document ensures the integrity and authenticity
  of the identity provider's metadata. This practice enhances security posture by
  ensuring the correct implementation of authentication protocols, aligning with industry
  standards, and supporting regulatory compliance.
