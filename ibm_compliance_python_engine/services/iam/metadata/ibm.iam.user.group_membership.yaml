rule_id: ibm.iam.user.group_membership
title: Enforce IAM User Group Membership for Enhanced Access Control
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that users are part of appropriate IAM groups is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture. Group memberships allow for centralized management of
  access rights, reducing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
  This practice helps organizations adhere to the principle of least privilege, minimizing
  potential security breaches and aligning with compliance standards.
description: This rule checks that all IAM users are assigned to at least one predefined
  group within the IBM Cloud environment. By mandating group membership, the rule
  enforces consistent application of access policies and permissions. This aids in
  streamlining identity management processes and ensures that users have only the
  necessary access rights, thereby mitigating risks associated with excessive permissions.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and
  NIST, which require stringent access control measures.
