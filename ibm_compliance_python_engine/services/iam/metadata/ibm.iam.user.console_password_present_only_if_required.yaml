rule_id: ibm.iam.user.console_password_present_only_if_required
title: Ensure Console Passwords are Set Only When Necessary
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the requirement that console passwords are present only when
  strictly necessary helps minimize potential attack vectors and reduces the risk
  of unauthorized access. This security measure ensures that user accounts do not
  have unnecessary or default credentials, which could be exploited by attackers to
  gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, ultimately protecting the organization's
  data integrity and compliance posture.
description: This rule checks whether user accounts on IBM Cloud have console passwords
  set only when it is required for specific functionalities. By ensuring that unnecessary
  passwords are not present, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of credential
  theft or misuse. This practice aligns with the principle of least privilege and
  enhances the overall security posture by preventing unauthorized access attempts.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with security standards and regulations that
  mandate strong authentication practices, safeguarding sensitive information and
  maintaining trust with stakeholders.
