rule_id: ibm.iam.role.rbac_inline_policies_prohibited
title: Prohibition of RBAC Inline Policies in IBM IAM Roles
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Prohibiting inline policies directly within IAM roles ensures that access
  control configurations are centralized and easier to manage, reducing the risk of
  misconfigurations. Inline policies can lead to inconsistent application of permissions
  and make it difficult to audit and ensure compliance with organizational security
  policies. By enforcing this rule, organizations can maintain a robust security posture
  and reduce potential vectors for unauthorized access.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline policies directly attached
  to Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles within IBM Cloud environments. Inline
  policies, while flexible, can introduce complexity and inconsistency in access management
  practices, leading to oversight and potential security vulnerabilities. By adhering
  to the prohibition of RBAC inline policies, organizations can better manage access
  permissions through centralized policy frameworks, thereby enhancing security and
  aligning with best practices for compliance and governance. This approach facilitates
  easier audits, policy updates, and ensures a more streamlined and secure access
  management process.
