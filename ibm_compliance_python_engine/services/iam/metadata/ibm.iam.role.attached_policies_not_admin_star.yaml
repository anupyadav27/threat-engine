rule_id: ibm.iam.role.attached_policies_not_admin_star
title: 'Restrict IAM Role Policies: Avoid Wildcard Admin Privileges'
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: This rule is crucial to prevent overly permissive access that can lead
  to security breaches. Granting wildcard ('*') admin privileges to IAM roles can
  result in unauthorized access, data leaks, or malicious activities, severely impacting
  business operations and compliance with security standards.
description: This security rule evaluates IAM roles to ensure that attached policies
  do not grant admin privileges using wildcard characters ('*'). By limiting the scope
  of permissions, the rule helps in maintaining the principle of least privilege,
  thereby reducing the attack surface. Implementing this rule aligns with best practices
  in identity and access management, ensuring compliance with industry standards and
  mitigating risks associated with privilege escalation.
