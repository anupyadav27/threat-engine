title: Ensure SAML Audience Restriction is Configured for Identity Providers
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring SAML Audience Restriction is crucial for ensuring that SAML
  assertions are intended for specific services, mitigating the risk of assertion
  interception and misuse. This reduces potential exposure to unauthorized access
  and helps maintain the integrity of secure authentication processes, which is vital
  for protecting sensitive business information.
description: This rule checks whether SAML Audience Restriction is configured in the
  identity provider settings within IBM Cloud IAM. By ensuring that SAML assertions
  are restricted to specific audience URLs, this configuration helps to validate that
  the assertions are received by the correct service endpoints. This enforcement enhances
  overall security by preventing unauthorized entities from accepting SAML tokens,
  thus supporting compliance with industry standards and organizational security policies.
