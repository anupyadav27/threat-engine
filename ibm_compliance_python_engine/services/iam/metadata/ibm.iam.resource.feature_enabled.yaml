rule_id: ibm.iam.resource.feature_enabled
title: Ensure Critical IAM Features are Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling critical IAM features is crucial for maintaining robust security
  within the IBM Cloud environment. These features, such as multi-factor authentication
  and audit logging, help to prevent unauthorized access to resources and provide
  a trail for compliance verification. Failure to enable these features can lead to
  security breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations, potentially resulting
  in financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that essential IAM features are enabled on IBM Cloud
  resources to ensure a secure identity and access management posture. It checks for
  features like multi-factor authentication, password policies, and detailed audit
  logging. Enabling these features enhances security by adding layers of protection
  against unauthorized access and ensuring detailed monitoring of access activities.
  Compliance with this rule helps organizations align with regulatory standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents and ensuring
  accountability.
