title: Restrict User Consent in IBM Cloud IAM Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Restricting user consent for applications mitigates the risk of unauthorized
  access to sensitive resources. By controlling user consent, organizations ensure
  that applications can only access necessary data, thereby reducing the attack surface
  and potential data exposure. This control is crucial for maintaining compliance
  with data protection regulations and safeguarding organizational assets.
description: This rule evaluates IAM policies to ensure that user consent for applications
  is appropriately restricted. By enforcing this policy, organizations can prevent
  applications from obtaining undue permissions that could lead to data leaks or unauthorized
  data manipulation. This rule enhances security by ensuring that only vetted applications
  can access specific resources, thus maintaining a robust security posture. Adhering
  to this rule also aids in compliance with industry standards and regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict access control and data protection measures.
