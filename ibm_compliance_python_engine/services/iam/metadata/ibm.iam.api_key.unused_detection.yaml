rule_id: ibm.iam.api_key.unused_detection
title: Detect and Mitigate Unused IBM Cloud API Keys
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Unused API keys pose a significant security risk as they can be exploited
  by unauthorized users if not properly managed. Regular detection and remediation
  of unused API keys help to minimize the attack surface, reducing the likelihood
  of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thus preserving the integrity
  and confidentiality of cloud resources.
description: This rule identifies API keys within the IBM Cloud Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) service that have not been used for a specified period. By detecting
  these unused keys, organizations can enforce best practices for key management,
  including the timely rotation and deactivation of dormant keys. This proactive security
  measure assists in maintaining a robust security posture by limiting potential entry
  points for attackers, thereby aligning with compliance standards that mandate the
  protection of access credentials.
