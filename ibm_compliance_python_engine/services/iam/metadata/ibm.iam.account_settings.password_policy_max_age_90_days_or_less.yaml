rule_id: ibm.iam.account_settings.password_policy_max_age_90_days_or_less
title: Enforce Password Policy Max Age of 90 Days or Less
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Regularly updating passwords helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access
  due to compromised credentials. By enforcing a maximum password age of 90 days or
  less, organizations can ensure that passwords are changed frequently, reducing the
  window of opportunity for threat actors to exploit stolen passwords. This practice
  not only enhances security but also aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements for identity and access management.
description: This rule checks that the password policy for IBM Cloud IAM account settings
  enforces a maximum password age of 90 days or less. By implementing this policy,
  organizations compel users to change their passwords regularly, which decreases
  the likelihood of long-term exposure to compromised credentials. This proactive
  measure strengthens the security posture by ensuring that passwords do not remain
  static over extended periods, thus protecting sensitive resources and data. Adhering
  to this rule also supports compliance with various security frameworks and regulations
  that mandate periodic password updates.
