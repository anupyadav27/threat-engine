title: Limit Global Admin Access to Fewer Than Five Users
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Limiting the number of users with global admin privileges is crucial to
  minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of critical resources.
  Reducing the number of global administrators helps protect sensitive data and system
  integrity, thereby preventing potential breaches that could have significant business
  and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks that the number of users with global admin privileges
  in your IBM Cloud account does not exceed four. By enforcing this limit, the rule
  ensures a reduced attack surface and mitigates the risk of privilege escalation
  attacks. Implementing such controls is vital for maintaining a robust security posture
  by adhering to the principle of least privilege. Compliance with this rule also
  aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for access management.
