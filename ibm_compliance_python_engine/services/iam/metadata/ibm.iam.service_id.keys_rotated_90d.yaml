title: Enforce 90-Day Rotation for IBM IAM Service ID Keys
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Regular rotation of service ID keys is crucial for minimizing the risk
  of unauthorized access due to key compromise. By enforcing a 90-day rotation policy,
  organizations can significantly reduce the attack surface and potential impact of
  a leaked or stolen key, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance
  with industry best practices.
description: This rule checks whether service ID keys within the IBM Cloud Identity
  and Access Management (IAM) are rotated at least every 90 days. Regular key rotation
  is a proactive measure that helps mitigate the risk of key exposure and unauthorized
  access. Ensuring that keys are not used beyond their recommended lifecycle enhances
  the overall security posture and aids in achieving compliance with regulatory requirements.
  Implementing this rule helps organizations maintain strong authentication mechanisms
  and safeguard their cloud resources from potential threats.
