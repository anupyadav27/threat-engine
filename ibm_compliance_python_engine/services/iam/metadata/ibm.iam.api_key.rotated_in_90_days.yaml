rule_id: ibm.iam.api_key.rotated_in_90_days
title: Regular Rotation of IBM Cloud API Keys Every 90 Days
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Regular rotation of API keys is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access due to compromised credentials. By enforcing a 90-day rotation policy, organizations
  can significantly reduce the window of opportunity for attackers, thereby protecting
  sensitive resources and maintaining trust with clients and stakeholders.
description: This security rule ensures that all API keys within IBM Cloud's Identity
  and Access Management (IAM) are rotated at least every 90 days. The rule checks
  the last rotation date of each API key and flags those that have not been updated
  within this timeframe. Regularly rotating API keys helps prevent unauthorized access
  by limiting the lifespan of potentially exposed credentials. This practice not only
  enhances the security posture by adhering to the principle of least privilege but
  also aligns with industry compliance standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP
  800-53, ensuring that access controls are consistently updated and effective.
