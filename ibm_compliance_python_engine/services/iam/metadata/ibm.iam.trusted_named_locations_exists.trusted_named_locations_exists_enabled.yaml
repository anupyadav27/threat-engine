title: Ensure Trusted Named Locations are Configured and Enabled for IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring trusted named locations enhances security by ensuring that
  access to IBM Cloud resources is limited to pre-defined, secure geographic locations.
  This reduces the risk of unauthorized access attempts from unknown or malicious
  locations, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that trusted named locations are configured and enabled
  within the Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings of your IBM Cloud environment.
  By implementing this configuration, administrators can restrict access to cloud
  resources from specified geographic locations, thus enforcing location-based access
  controls. This practice not only strengthens the security posture of the organization
  by mitigating location-based threats but also supports compliance with various industry
  standards that require geographical access restrictions.
