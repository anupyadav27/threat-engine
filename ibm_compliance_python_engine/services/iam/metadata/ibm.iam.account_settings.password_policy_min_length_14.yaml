title: Enforce Minimum Password Length of 14 for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing a minimum password length of 14 characters significantly strengthens
  account security by making passwords more resistant to brute-force attacks. Longer
  passwords reduce the risk of unauthorized access, thereby protecting sensitive data
  and maintaining compliance with industry best practices. This rule ensures that
  users employ stronger authentication methods, mitigating potential security breaches
  that could lead to financial and reputational damage.
description: This security rule ensures that the IBM Cloud account settings enforce
  a minimum password length of 14 characters for all user accounts. By verifying the
  password policy configuration, this rule helps organizations adhere to security
  standards and improve identity protection through stronger authentication measures.
  A robust password policy not only fortifies defenses against unauthorized access
  and data breaches but also aligns with compliance requirements, such as those outlined
  in various regulatory frameworks. This proactive measure contributes to a comprehensive
  security posture by minimizing vulnerabilities associated with weak passwords.
