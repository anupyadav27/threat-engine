rule_id: ibm.iam.resource.directory_log_forwarding_enabled
title: Ensure Directory Log Forwarding is Enabled for IAM Resources
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling directory log forwarding is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of IAM activities, which is essential for detecting unauthorized access
  attempts and ensuring accountability. It helps organizations meet compliance requirements
  by providing visibility into user actions and system changes, thus protecting against
  potential security breaches and data leaks.
description: This rule checks whether directory log forwarding is enabled for IAM
  resources within the IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring that logs are forwarded
  to a centralized logging system, organizations can monitor and analyze IAM activities
  in real-time or retrospectively. This practice enhances the security posture by
  facilitating incident response and forensic investigations. Furthermore, it supports
  compliance with regulatory standards that require detailed audit logging, such as
  GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that access and changes to resources are meticulously
  recorded and available for review.
