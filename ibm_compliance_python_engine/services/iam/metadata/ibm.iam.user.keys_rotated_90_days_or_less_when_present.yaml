rule_id: ibm.iam.user.keys_rotated_90_days_or_less_when_present
title: User Keys Must Be Rotated Every 90 Days for Optimal Security
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Regular rotation of user keys is essential to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access due to compromised or outdated credentials. Ensuring keys are rotated every
  90 days helps maintain robust security standards, reducing the likelihood of a prolonged
  security breach. This practice supports compliance with industry regulations and
  fosters trust in your organization's commitment to safeguarding sensitive data.
description: This rule checks for user keys within the IBM Cloud Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) service that have not been rotated in the last 90 days. By enforcing
  key rotation, this measure minimizes the risk of credentials being exposed or exploited
  over time, thus enhancing the overall security posture of your cloud environment.
  Regular key rotation aligns with industry best practices for authentication and
  access management, helping organizations meet compliance requirements and protect
  their cloud resources from unauthorized access.
