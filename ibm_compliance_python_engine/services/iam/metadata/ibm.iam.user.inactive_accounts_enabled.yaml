rule_id: ibm.iam.user.inactive_accounts_enabled
title: Ensure Inactive IAM User Accounts are Disabled for Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Monitoring and disabling inactive user accounts is crucial to reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access to IBM Cloud resources. Inactive accounts can become
  a target for exploitation by malicious actors, potentially leading to data breaches
  and unauthorized resource usage. By managing inactive accounts, organizations can
  enhance their security posture and comply with industry standards for identity governance.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inactive user accounts within the
  IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. Inactive accounts, identified
  by prolonged periods of non-use, should be disabled to prevent unauthorized access
  and mitigate security risks. Regularly auditing and disabling these accounts not
  only strengthens security by minimizing potential attack vectors but also ensures
  compliance with best practices and regulatory requirements related to identity and
  access management. Implementing this rule helps maintain an optimal security posture
  by ensuring that only active, necessary accounts have access to cloud resources.
