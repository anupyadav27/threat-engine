title: Restrict Guest User Access to Sensitive IAM Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing access restrictions for guest users is crucial to maintaining
  robust security postures and protecting sensitive resources. Guest users often have
  limited understanding of the system's security requirements and may inadvertently
  pose risks by accessing or modifying critical resources. By restricting their access,
  organizations can minimize potential vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with
  security best practices.
description: This rule ensures that guest users are restricted from accessing or modifying
  IAM policies that govern key organizational resources. The check verifies that guest
  user permissions are limited to non-sensitive actions and resources, thereby preventing
  unauthorized access or changes to critical configurations. By enforcing these restrictions,
  the organization reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized modifications,
  aligning with regulatory compliance requirements and enhancing the overall security
  posture of the IBM Cloud environment.
