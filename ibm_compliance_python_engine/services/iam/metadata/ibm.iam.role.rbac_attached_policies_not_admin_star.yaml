rule_id: ibm.iam.role.rbac_attached_policies_not_admin_star
title: 'Enforce Least Privilege: Avoid Admin * in RBAC Policies'
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that RBAC policies do not include overly permissive settings,
  such as Admin *, is critical for maintaining a secure cloud environment. Granting
  excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potentially
  resulting in data breaches, compliance violations, and significant business disruptions.
description: This rule checks for the presence of overly permissive policies, specifically
  those including Admin *, attached to IAM roles within IBM Cloud. By enforcing the
  principle of least privilege, this rule helps to restrict access rights for users
  to the minimum necessary to perform their job functions. Implementing this rule
  enhances security by reducing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized
  access, while also supporting compliance with industry standards and regulations
  that mandate stringent access controls.
