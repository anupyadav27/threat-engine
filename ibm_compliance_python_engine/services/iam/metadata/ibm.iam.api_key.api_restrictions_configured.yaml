title: Enforce API Key Restrictions for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring API restrictions is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access and minimize the attack surface. By restricting API keys to specific services,
  IP addresses, or actions, organizations can prevent misuse and reduce the potential
  for data breaches, ensuring that API keys are used in a controlled and secure manner.
description: This rule checks whether API keys in IBM Cloud have appropriate restrictions
  configured, such as limiting access to specific resources or IP addresses. Restricting
  API keys helps to enforce the principle of least privilege by ensuring that keys
  are not used beyond their intended scope. This enhances the security posture by
  preventing unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration. Implementing API
  restrictions aligns with industry best practices and complies with regulatory requirements
  for access control and monitoring.
