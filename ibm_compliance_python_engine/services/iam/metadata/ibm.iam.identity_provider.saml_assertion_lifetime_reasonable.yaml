title: Ensure Reasonable SAML Assertion Lifetime for Identity Providers
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Maintaining a reasonable lifetime for SAML assertions is crucial for mitigating
  risks associated with replay attacks and unauthorized access. A shorter assertion
  lifespan reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit stolen or intercepted
  tokens, thereby enhancing the overall security of identity and access management
  processes on IBM Cloud.
description: This rule checks if the SAML assertion lifetime configured for identity
  providers in IBM Cloud is set to a reasonable duration, typically no longer than
  a few minutes. By limiting the validity period of SAML assertions, organizations
  can reduce the risk of compromised credentials being used maliciously. Implementing
  this control aligns with best practices for authentication and helps organizations
  meet compliance requirements by enforcing stringent access controls and session
  management policies.
