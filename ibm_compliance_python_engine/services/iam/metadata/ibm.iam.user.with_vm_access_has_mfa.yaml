title: Enforce MFA for Users with Virtual Machine Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for users with virtual machine
  access significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, which could lead to
  data breaches or service disruptions. By requiring MFA, organizations can ensure
  that even if user credentials are compromised, an additional verification step is
  needed, enhancing overall security posture and protecting sensitive resources.
description: This rule verifies that all users with access to virtual machines within
  the IBM Cloud environment have MFA enabled. The presence of MFA adds an additional
  layer of security beyond traditional password-based authentication, mitigating risks
  associated with credential theft. Enforcing MFA not only aligns with best practices
  for identity and access management but also helps organizations meet compliance
  requirements stipulated by security standards, such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53,
  improving trust and reliability.
