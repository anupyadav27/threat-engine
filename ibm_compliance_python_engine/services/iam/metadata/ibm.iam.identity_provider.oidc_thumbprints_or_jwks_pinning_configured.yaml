title: Enforce OIDC Thumbprints or JWKS Pinning for Enhanced Identity Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring OIDC thumbprints or JWKS pinning is crucial for verifying the
  authenticity of identity providers. Without this configuration, there is a risk
  of man-in-the-middle attacks where malicious actors could intercept or alter authentication
  tokens, leading to unauthorized access. Implementing these configurations strengthens
  security by ensuring that tokens are issued by trusted and verified identity providers,
  thereby protecting sensitive business data and maintaining compliance with industry
  standards.
description: This rule checks whether OIDC thumbprints or JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)
  pinning is configured for identity providers in IBM Cloud. By enforcing this configuration,
  the system ensures that the public keys used to sign identity tokens are valid and
  have not been tampered with, preventing potential exploits and unauthorized access.
  This practice not only enhances the security posture by preventing token forgery
  but also aids in meeting compliance requirements for secure identity management.
  It is especially relevant for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of authentication
  processes within the IAM domain.
