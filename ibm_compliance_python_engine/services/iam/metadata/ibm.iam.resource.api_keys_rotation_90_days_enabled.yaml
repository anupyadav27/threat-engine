title: Enforce 90-Day Rotation for IBM Cloud API Keys
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Regular rotation of API keys is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized
  access due to compromised or exposed credentials. Enforcing a 90-day rotation policy
  helps mitigate security threats by ensuring that keys are regularly updated, reducing
  the window of opportunity for malicious actors. This practice not only enhances
  security but also aligns with industry best practices and compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks that all API keys associated with IBM Cloud IAM resources
  are configured to rotate every 90 days. By enforcing the rotation of API keys, organizations
  can significantly reduce the likelihood of expired or compromised keys being exploited.
  Regular key rotation is a proactive security measure that helps maintain the integrity
  and confidentiality of sensitive data and resources. It also aids in meeting compliance
  standards such as PCI DSS, which mandates regular key rotation to protect payment
  data.
