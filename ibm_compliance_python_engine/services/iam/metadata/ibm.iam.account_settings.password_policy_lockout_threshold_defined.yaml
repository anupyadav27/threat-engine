rule_id: ibm.iam.account_settings.password_policy_lockout_threshold_defined
title: Ensure Password Policy Lockout Threshold is Configured
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring a lockout threshold for password attempts is crucial in mitigating
  brute force attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  By defining a limit on failed login attempts, organizations can protect sensitive
  information and maintain trust with stakeholders, ensuring that only authorized
  users can access critical resources.
description: This rule checks whether a password lockout threshold is set within the
  IBM Cloud IAM account settings. The lockout threshold specifies the number of consecutive
  failed login attempts that will trigger a temporary account lockout. By enforcing
  such a policy, organizations can deter attackers from using automated tools to guess
  passwords and gain unauthorized access. This security control not only strengthens
  the overall security posture of the cloud environment but also helps in achieving
  compliance with industry standards and regulations that require robust access controls.
