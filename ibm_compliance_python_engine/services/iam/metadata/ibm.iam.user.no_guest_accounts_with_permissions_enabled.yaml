rule_id: ibm.iam.user.no_guest_accounts_with_permissions_enabled
title: Enforce Zero Permissions for Guest Accounts in IBM Cloud IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that guest accounts have no permissions is vital to prevent unauthorized
  access and reduce the risk of data breaches. Unauthorized users with permission
  can exploit vulnerabilities, leading to potential data loss and reputational damage.
  It is critical to maintain strict access controls to safeguard sensitive information
  and comply with industry regulations.
description: This rule evaluates IAM user configurations to ensure that guest accounts
  do not have any permissions enabled. By enforcing this policy, organizations can
  mitigate security risks associated with unauthorized access and privilege misuse.
  Implementing this rule supports adherence to best practices in identity and access
  management, enhancing overall security posture and aiding compliance with standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular audits of account permissions contribute to a secure
  and resilient cloud environment.
