title: Enforce Least Privilege for Service ID Scopes and Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for service ID scopes and roles is crucial
  to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that service IDs are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their functions,
  organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and protect sensitive
  data, thereby maintaining trust and compliance.
description: This rule checks that service IDs within IBM Cloud are configured with
  the least privilege principle, ensuring they are assigned only the necessary scopes
  or roles to perform their required tasks. By limiting permissions, this rule enhances
  security by reducing the likelihood of privilege escalation and unauthorized access
  to critical resources. This practice aligns with compliance frameworks and security
  best practices, aiding organizations in meeting regulatory requirements while safeguarding
  their cloud environments.
