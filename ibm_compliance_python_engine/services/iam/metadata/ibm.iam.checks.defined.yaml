title: Ensure IAM Security Checks are Defined for Robust Authentication
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Defining IAM security checks is crucial to maintain a secure cloud environment
  as it establishes a baseline for authentication practices. This rule helps prevent
  unauthorized access by ensuring that all authentication mechanisms are clearly defined,
  reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing overall system integrity.
description: This rule verifies that all identity and access management (IAM) security
  checks are explicitly defined within the IBM Cloud environment. By clearly defining
  these checks, organizations can enforce consistent authentication protocols across
  their cloud resources, enhancing security by ensuring that only authorized users
  have access. This practice not only mitigates the risk of unauthorized access but
  also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate stringent
  access control measures.
