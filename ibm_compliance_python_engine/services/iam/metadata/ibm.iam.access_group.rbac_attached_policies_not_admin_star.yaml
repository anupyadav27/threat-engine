title: Ensure RBAC Policies Avoid Overbroad Admin Permissions in Access Groups
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies do not grant broad
  "admin" permissions is crucial for maintaining the principle of least privilege.
  Over-privileged access can lead to unauthorized data access, accidental data modification,
  or malicious exploitation, significantly impacting the organization's security posture
  and compliance status.
description: This rule checks for access group policies within IBM Cloud that assign
  overly permissive roles, such as "admin" with wildcard (*) resources, which can
  inadvertently expose sensitive resources across the platform. By enforcing more
  granular permissions, this rule helps to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Implementing this control supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations by ensuring that access rights are appropriately
  restricted and monitored.
