rule_id: ibm.iam.user.mfa_required
title: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for IBM Cloud IAM Users
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a critical security measure that adds
  an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access to IBM Cloud resources.
  By requiring MFA, organizations significantly reduce the risk of compromised credentials
  leading to data breaches, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining
  business continuity.
description: This rule mandates that all users within IBM Cloud Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) must enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access their accounts.
  The enforcement of MFA ensures that even if a user's password is compromised, an
  additional verification step is required, which enhances the overall security posture.
  Implementing this rule aligns with industry best practices for authentication and
  helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, such as those outlined
  in standards like NIST and ISO 27001.
