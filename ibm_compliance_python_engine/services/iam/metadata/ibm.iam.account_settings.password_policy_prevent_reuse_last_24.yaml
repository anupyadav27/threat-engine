title: Enforce Password Reuse Prevention for Last 24 Passwords in IBM Cloud IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing a password policy that prevents the reuse of the last 24 passwords
  significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to password cycling. This
  practice mitigates the threat posed by attackers who might exploit reused credentials,
  thus safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining system integrity.
description: This security rule checks whether the IBM Cloud IAM account settings
  enforce a password policy that prevents users from reusing any of their last 24
  passwords. By ensuring that users must create unique passwords, the rule enhances
  security by making it more difficult for attackers to gain access through previously
  compromised credentials. Additionally, adhering to this policy supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations that require strong authentication measures,
  thereby protecting the organization from potential breaches and regulatory penalties.
