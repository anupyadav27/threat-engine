title: Restrict OIDC Allowed Client IDs and Audiences for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing restrictions on OIDC allowed client IDs and audiences is crucial
  to ensure that only authorized applications can request tokens from the identity
  provider. This minimizes the risk of token misuse by unauthorized entities, thereby
  protecting sensitive information. Ensuring tight control over these settings is
  vital for maintaining the integrity of authentication processes and safeguarding
  business operations.
description: This security rule checks whether OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers
  in IBM Cloud have restricted configurations for allowed client IDs and audiences.
  By enforcing these restrictions, organizations can limit the issuance of tokens
  to trusted applications, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. This practice
  aligns with compliance standards that require stringent access controls and helps
  in maintaining a robust security posture by preventing potential exploitation of
  authentication mechanisms.
