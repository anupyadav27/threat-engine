title: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for Enhanced Account Security
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial for securing user
  accounts against unauthorized access and credential theft. By requiring an additional
  verification step beyond the standard username and password, MFA significantly reduces
  the risk of compromised accounts, protecting sensitive data and maintaining business
  continuity.
description: This rule verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled in IBM
  Cloud account settings, ensuring that all users are required to provide a second
  form of verification during login. By implementing MFA, organizations can enhance
  their security posture by mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, thereby safeguarding
  critical resources and sensitive information. Compliance with industry standards
  and regulations is also strengthened, as many frameworks mandate the use of MFA
  as a best practice for identity and access management.
