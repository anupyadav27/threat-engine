rule_id: ibm.iam.service_id.role_policies_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege on IBM Cloud IAM Service IDs
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for IBM Cloud IAM service
  IDs is crucial for minimizing security risks and preventing unauthorized access.
  Excessive permissions can lead to potential data breaches and misuse of resources,
  posing significant business and operational impacts. By ensuring service IDs only
  have the permissions necessary for their function, organizations can reduce attack
  surfaces and comply with security standards.
description: This rule checks that IBM Cloud IAM service IDs are assigned the minimum
  necessary role policies required to perform their functions. By enforcing least
  privilege, organizations can ensure that service IDs do not have excessive access
  rights, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and data exposure. Adhering
  to this rule enhances overall security posture and aids in meeting compliance requirements
  such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other industry standards. It provides a systematic approach
  to managing permissions, promoting a secure and efficient cloud environment.
