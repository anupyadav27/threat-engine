rule_id: ibm.iam.user.inactive_90_days_disabled
title: Enforce Account Disablement for Users Inactive Over 90 Days
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that user accounts are disabled after 90 days of inactivity mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access, particularly from accounts that are no longer monitored
  or required. This practice reduces potential attack vectors by ensuring that stale
  accounts cannot be exploited by malicious actors, thereby protecting sensitive data
  and resources.
description: This rule checks for user accounts that have been inactive for a period
  of 90 days and ensures they are disabled automatically. By enforcing this policy,
  organizations can maintain tighter control over user access, minimizing the risk
  of credential misuse. This practice aligns with best practices for identity and
  access management, ensuring compliance with security standards by minimizing exposure
  to threats associated with orphaned accounts. Implementing this rule helps maintain
  a secure and compliant environment by ensuring that only active and necessary accounts
  have access to resources.
