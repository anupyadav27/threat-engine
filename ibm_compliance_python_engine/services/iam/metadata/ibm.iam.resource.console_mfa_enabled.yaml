rule_id: ibm.iam.resource.console_mfa_enabled
title: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for IBM Cloud Console Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IBM Cloud console access
  significantly enhances security by requiring an additional verification step, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. This is critical
  for protecting sensitive resources and data, thereby minimizing potential financial
  and reputational damage resulting from security breaches.
description: This rule verifies that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled
  for users accessing the IBM Cloud console, ensuring that all login attempts are
  subject to an additional layer of security beyond just a username and password.
  By enforcing MFA, organizations can bolster their identity and access management
  strategy, aligning with best practices and compliance frameworks that mandate enhanced
  authentication mechanisms. This helps to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access,
  safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining trust with stakeholders.
