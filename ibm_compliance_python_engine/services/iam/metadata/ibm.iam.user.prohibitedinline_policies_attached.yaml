title: Restrict Inline Policies for Enhanced IAM Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Inline policies tied directly to users can lead to security risks as they
  are difficult to track and manage, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access.
  Instead, using managed policies ensures consistent permission management, reduces
  complexity, and enhances auditability, thereby minimizing potential security breaches
  and ensuring regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline policies directly attached
  to IAM users within IBM Cloud. By prohibiting inline policies, organizations can
  enforce the use of managed policies, which allows for centralized management and
  consistent application of security controls. This approach simplifies policy auditing
  and reduces the risk of privilege escalation by ensuring that permissions are not
  inadvertently granted or retained. Adhering to this rule not only strengthens security
  posture but also aligns with best practices for identity and access management,
  supporting compliance with standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
