rule_id: ibm.iam.resource.defaults_enabled
title: Ensure Default IAM Resource Security Configurations Are Enabled
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling default security configurations for IAM resources is crucial for
  maintaining a secure environment by providing a baseline of security controls. This
  practice mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access and ensures compliance
  with organizational security policies. It also streamlines the process of access
  management, reducing the potential for human error in manual configurations which
  could lead to security breaches.
description: The rule checks whether default security settings for IAM resources are
  enabled within your IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring these defaults are active,
  organizations can leverage pre-configured, best-practice security settings that
  align with industry standards. This approach enhances the security posture by ensuring
  consistent application of security controls across all IAM resources. Furthermore,
  it assists in achieving compliance with regulatory frameworks by automatically enforcing
  security guidelines, reducing the administrative overhead of manual audits and configurations.
