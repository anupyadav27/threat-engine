rule_id: ibm.iam.policy.guest_invite_only_for_admin_roles
title: Restrict Guest Invites to Admin Roles for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Limiting the ability to invite guest users to only those with admin roles
  is crucial for maintaining a secure IBM Cloud environment. This rule helps prevent
  unauthorized access, reducing the risk of potential data breaches and ensuring that
  guest access is tightly controlled by trusted personnel. By enforcing this restriction,
  organizations can maintain stricter oversight and compliance with security policies,
  safeguarding sensitive information.
description: This rule checks whether guest invitations are restricted to users with
  administrative roles within the IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
  By implementing this rule, organizations ensure that only authorized administrators
  can extend access to external guests, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  actions. This helps improve the overall security posture by ensuring that guest
  access is granted under strict supervision, which is essential for compliance with
  industry standards and internal security policies. This practice also aids in maintaining
  an audit trail of who has access to critical resources, aligning with best practices
  for identity management.
