rule_id: ibm.iam.policy.require_mfa_for_management_api
title: Enforce MFA for Enhanced Security on IBM Cloud Management API Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing the IBM Cloud
  Management API is crucial for bolstering security against unauthorized access. Implementing
  MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials being used to access
  sensitive management operations, thereby protecting critical cloud resources and
  maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule mandates the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
  interactions with the IBM Cloud Management API, ensuring that only authenticated
  and authorized users can perform management operations. By enforcing MFA, organizations
  add an additional layer of security beyond standard username and password logins,
  effectively mitigating the risks of credential theft and unauthorized access. This
  practice not only enhances the overall security posture but also aligns with compliance
  requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR, which advocate for strong authentication
  mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
