rule_id: ibm.iam.policy.default_users_cannot_create_security_groups
title: Restrict Default Users from Creating Security Groups in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Preventing default users from creating security groups is crucial to maintaining
  a secure cloud environment. Unrestricted creation of security groups by default
  users may lead to unauthorized access or misconfigurations, increasing the risk
  of data breaches. By enforcing this rule, organizations can ensure that only authorized
  personnel manage critical network security configurations, thereby minimizing potential
  security vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks whether default users within an IBM Cloud environment
  are restricted from creating security groups. It ensures that only users with the
  necessary permissions can define network security parameters, which is essential
  for maintaining a robust security posture. By implementing this rule, organizations
  can enforce stricter control over network access and configurations, aligning with
  compliance standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR. This rule enhances security by
  reducing the risk of accidental or malicious security group configurations that
  could expose sensitive data or systems to unauthorized access.
