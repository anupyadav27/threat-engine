rule_id: ibm.iam.policy.user_consent_for_verified_apps
title: Enforce User Consent for Third-Party App Access in IAM Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring user consent for verified third-party applications enhances security
  by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This rule helps maintain
  trust and compliance with privacy regulations, ultimately reducing potential data
  breaches and preserving organizational integrity.
description: This rule mandates that user consent must be obtained before granting
  verified third-party applications access through IAM policies. It checks for policies
  that may allow automatic access without explicit user consent, thereby reducing
  the risk of unauthorized data exposure. By enforcing this rule, organizations can
  increase their security posture, comply with data protection regulations, and maintain
  control over how and when external applications interact with their resources.
