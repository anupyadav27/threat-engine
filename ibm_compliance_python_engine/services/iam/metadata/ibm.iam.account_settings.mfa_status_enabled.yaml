title: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for Enhanced Account Security
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial for protecting user
  accounts from unauthorized access, especially in environments handling sensitive
  data. It significantly reduces the risk of breaches by requiring an additional verification
  factor beyond just a password, thus enhancing overall security posture and minimizing
  potential business disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that MFA is enabled in the IBM Cloud account settings,
  ensuring that all users are required to provide an additional verification factor
  when accessing the platform. By implementing MFA, organizations can significantly
  mitigate the risk of credential compromise and unauthorized access. This protection
  is vital for maintaining compliance with security standards and regulations, as
  it addresses key requirements for safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality
  in cloud environments.
