rule_id: ibm.iam.role.prohibitedinline_policies
title: Prohibit Use of Inline Policies for IAM Roles
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Inline policies attached directly to IAM roles can lead to complex and
  decentralized policy management, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and
  inadvertent policy misconfigurations. By prohibiting inline policies, organizations
  can enforce a centralized policy management strategy, reducing the potential for
  security breaches and ensuring consistent access controls across the IBM Cloud environment.
description: This rule ensures that inline policies are not used in IAM roles, promoting
  the use of managed policies instead. Inline policies can obscure the relationship
  between roles and their permissions, making it difficult to audit and enforce security
  controls. By restricting inline policies, organizations benefit from enhanced visibility
  and governance over their identity and access management, improving compliance with
  security standards and regulatory requirements. Managed policies provide a more
  robust framework for policy versioning, auditing, and lifecycle management, ensuring
  a more secure and compliant cloud infrastructure.
