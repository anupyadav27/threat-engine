title: Ensure Compliance with IBM Cloud Tenant Password Policy
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing a robust tenant password policy is crucial to safeguarding
  sensitive information within the IBM Cloud environment. It helps prevent unauthorized
  access due to weak or compromised passwords, thereby mitigating potential data breaches
  and ensuring business continuity. Adherence to password policy standards also supports
  regulatory compliance and enhances overall security posture.
description: This rule checks whether the tenant’s password policy in IBM Cloud is
  configured according to best practices and compliance requirements. It evaluates
  parameters such as password length, complexity, expiration, and history to ensure
  they meet or exceed industry standards. By enforcing a strong password policy, organizations
  can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
  Compliance with this rule demonstrates a commitment to security best practices and
  may also be a requirement for meeting various regulatory standards.
