rule_id: ibm.iam.policy.default_user_cannot_create_tenants
title: Restrict Tenant Creation to Non-Default Users in IBM IAM Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Limiting the ability to create tenants to non-default users is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and controlled cloud environment. Default users often have
  generalized permissions that could lead to unauthorized access or changes if not
  properly managed. By preventing default users from creating tenants, organizations
  can reduce the risk of misconfigurations and potential security breaches, ensuring
  that only authorized personnel have the capability to expand or modify the cloud
  infrastructure.
description: This rule ensures that default users within IBM Cloud Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) policies do not have the permissions necessary to create new tenants.
  By enforcing this restriction, the rule helps maintain a principle of least privilege,
  thereby reducing the attack surface and potential for unauthorized or accidental
  creation of resources. This control is critical for compliance with security standards
  that mandate strict access controls and segregation of duties. Implementing this
  rule helps organizations improve their security posture by ensuring that only vetted
  and intentional actions are taken by users with the appropriate level of access.
