title: Restrict Wildcard Permissions in IBM IAM Policies for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Allowing wildcard permissions in IAM policies poses significant security
  risks by granting overly broad access, which can be exploited by malicious actors
  or result in accidental data exposure. This rule helps mitigate potential security
  breaches and ensures that access is granted on a need-to-know basis, aligning with
  the principle of least privilege.
description: This rule checks for IAM policies that use wildcard (*) in both the action
  and resource fields, indicating unrestrained permissions. By restricting the use
  of wildcards, the rule enforces more granular access control, reducing the attack
  surface and preventing unauthorized access to IBM Cloud resources. Implementing
  this rule enhances compliance with security standards and best practices, ensuring
  that user permissions are tightly controlled and auditable.
