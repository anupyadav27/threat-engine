title: Enforce Trust Principals Allowlist for IAM Role Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing a trust principals allowlist for IAM roles is crucial to ensure
  that only pre-approved entities can assume roles, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access. This practice helps maintain a robust security posture by preventing malicious
  actors from exploiting overly permissive role trust policies, which can lead to
  data breaches and compromised systems.
description: This rule checks that IAM roles are configured to only allow trusted
  principals from an explicit allowlist, ensuring that role assumption is restricted
  to known and vetted entities. By implementing an allowlist, organizations can tightly
  control which principals are permitted to assume specific roles, thereby minimizing
  the attack surface and potential vectors for unauthorized access. This approach
  not only strengthens security but also aids in compliance with industry standards
  and regulatory requirements by demonstrating that access controls are in place and
  effectively managed.
