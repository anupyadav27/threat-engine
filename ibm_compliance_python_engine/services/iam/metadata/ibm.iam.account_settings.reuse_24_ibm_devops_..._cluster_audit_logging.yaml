title: Enforce 24-Hour Reuse for IBM DevOps Cluster Audit Logging
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Audit logging is critical for maintaining security and operational integrity
  within cloud environments. By enforcing a 24-hour reuse period for IBM DevOps Cluster
  audit logs, organizations can ensure timely capture and review of access and activity
  logs. This helps in identifying potential security incidents and operational anomalies,
  thus mitigating risks and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks the configuration of IBM DevOps Cluster audit logging
  to ensure that it adheres to a 24-hour reuse policy. This means that logs are retained
  and recycled every 24 hours, providing a consistent and up-to-date trail of activities.
  Enforcing this policy enhances security by ensuring that logs are comprehensive
  and promptly available for security reviews and incident response. Additionally,
  it aligns with best practices for compliance frameworks that require regular logging
  and monitoring of access and activities within cloud environments.
