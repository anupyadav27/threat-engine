rule_id: ibm.iam.user.has_mfa
title: Enforce MFA for Enhanced IAM User Authentication
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial for securing sensitive
  resources on the IBM Cloud platform. By requiring MFA, organizations can significantly
  reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. This security
  measure helps protect against identity theft and data breaches, ensuring compliance
  with security standards and maintaining business integrity.
description: This rule checks if MFA is enabled for all IAM users within the IBM Cloud
  environment. Implementing MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring
  users to provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access to the system.
  This practice not only enhances the overall security posture by mitigating risks
  associated with single-factor authentication weaknesses but also aids in meeting
  regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Ensuring that all users
  have MFA enabled helps prevent unauthorized access and protects sensitive information
  from potential threats.
