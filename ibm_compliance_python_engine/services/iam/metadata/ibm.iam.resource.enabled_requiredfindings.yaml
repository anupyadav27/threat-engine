rule_id: ibm.iam.resource.enabled_requiredfindings
title: Enforce Required Findings for Enhanced IAM Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that required findings are enabled for IBM Cloud Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) resources is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant
  cloud environment. This practice assists organizations in identifying potential
  security risks and addressing them promptly, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access and ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements. By mandating required
  findings, businesses can enhance their security posture and protect sensitive data.
description: This rule checks whether the required findings are enabled for IAM resources
  within the IBM Cloud environment. Enabling required findings ensures that security
  assessments are continuously performed on IAM configurations, helping to identify
  vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. This proactive approach strengthens the overall
  security framework and aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and
  regulations. By implementing this rule, organizations can ensure that their IAM
  resources are consistently monitored and that any deviations from security policies
  are promptly addressed.
