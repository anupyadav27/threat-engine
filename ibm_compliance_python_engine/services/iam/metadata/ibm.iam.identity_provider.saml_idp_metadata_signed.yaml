title: Ensure SAML IdP Metadata is Signed for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that SAML Identity Provider (IdP) metadata is signed is crucial
  for maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the identity data exchanged between
  the IdP and IBM Cloud services. Signed metadata helps prevent unauthorized access
  and mitigates the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, which can lead to data breaches
  and compliance violations. By enforcing this rule, organizations can enhance their
  security posture and ensure trust in their identity management processes.
description: This rule verifies that the SAML IdP metadata used within IBM Cloud Identity
  and Access Management (IAM) is signed. The signing of metadata ensures that it has
  not been tampered with and that it originates from a trusted source. By mandating
  signed metadata, organizations can protect against potential security vulnerabilities,
  such as spoofing attacks and unauthorized data manipulation. Compliance with this
  rule not only strengthens security but also aligns with industry best practices
  for identity and access management, thereby supporting adherence to regulatory requirements.
