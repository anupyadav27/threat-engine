title: Enforce RBAC Conditions in IAM Policies to Enhance Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) conditions in IAM policies
  is crucial for fine-grained access management. It ensures that users and services
  only have access to the resources necessary for their roles, thereby minimizing
  potential security risks. This practice helps organizations mitigate unauthorized
  access and reduce the likelihood of privilege escalation, thus protecting sensitive
  data and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks IAM policies to confirm the use of RBAC conditions where
  applicable, ensuring that access permissions are appropriately scoped and aligned
  with organizational policies. By enforcing RBAC conditions, organizations can limit
  access based on contextual factors such as time, location, or user attributes, enhancing
  security posture. This approach not only helps in maintaining least privilege access
  but also aids in adhering to compliance standards by providing clear, auditable
  access trails.
