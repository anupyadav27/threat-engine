rule_id: ibm.iam.account_settings.identity_federation_status_enabled
title: Ensure Identity Federation is Enabled for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Identity Federation allows organizations to use external identity
  providers for authentication, thereby centralizing and streamlining identity management
  across cloud services. This not only enhances security by reducing the attack surface
  associated with managing multiple identities but also aids in compliance with regulations
  that require strong authentication mechanisms. Failure to enable identity federation
  can lead to increased risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether Identity Federation is enabled within the account
  settings on IBM Cloud. Identity Federation allows users to authenticate through
  trusted external identity providers, improving security by leveraging established
  identity management systems. Enabling this feature reduces the need for maintaining
  multiple credentials, thereby minimizing the risk of credential theft and enhancing
  the overall security posture. Additionally, it supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulations that mandate robust authentication processes. By ensuring
  Identity Federation is enabled, organizations can achieve a consistent and secure
  authentication framework across their cloud environment.
