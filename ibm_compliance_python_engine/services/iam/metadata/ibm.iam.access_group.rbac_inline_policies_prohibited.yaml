title: Prohibition of Inline RBAC Policies in Access Groups for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing the prohibition of inline RBAC policies within access groups
  is crucial for maintaining a consistent and manageable security posture. Inline
  policies can lead to fragmented and inconsistent access control, increasing the
  risk of unauthorized access. By centralizing policy management, organizations can
  ensure that access rights are properly governed and aligned with compliance requirements,
  minimizing the potential for security breaches and reducing administrative overhead.
description: This rule checks for the presence of inline Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC) policies within IBM Cloud access groups, ensuring that all access policies
  are defined and managed centrally. Inline policies, which are directly attached
  to individual resources, can become difficult to track and audit, leading to potential
  security vulnerabilities. By prohibiting inline policies, organizations can centralize
  policy management, making it easier to enforce security standards and achieve compliance
  with industry regulations. This approach simplifies access management and enhances
  the overall security posture of the IBM Cloud environment by ensuring that access
  controls are consistently applied across all resources.
