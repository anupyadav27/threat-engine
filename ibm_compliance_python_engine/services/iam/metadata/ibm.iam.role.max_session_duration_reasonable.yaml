title: Ensure Reasonable Max Session Duration for IAM Roles
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Setting a reasonable maximum session duration for IAM roles is crucial
  to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access through prolonged sessions. By limiting
  session duration, organizations can reduce the window of opportunity for potential
  attackers to exploit compromised credentials, thereby enhancing the overall security
  posture of their cloud environment.
description: This rule checks that the maximum session duration for IAM roles is set
  to a reasonable value, typically less than or equal to 12 hours. By enforcing a
  shorter session duration, it requires users to reauthenticate more frequently, thereby
  reducing the risk of session hijacking. This practice is aligned with security best
  practices and compliance requirements, ensuring that access is granted only to authenticated
  and authorized users, thereby protecting sensitive resources.
