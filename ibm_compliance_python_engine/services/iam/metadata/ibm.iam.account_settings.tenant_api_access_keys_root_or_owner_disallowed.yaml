rule_id: ibm.iam.account_settings.tenant_api_access_keys_root_or_owner_disallowed
title: Restrict Root and Owner API Keys for Enhanced Security
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: This rule is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  misuse of privileged accounts within the IBM Cloud environment. Allowing root or
  owner API keys increases the likelihood of accidental or malicious actions that
  could compromise sensitive data and disrupt business operations. By disallowing
  these keys, organizations can enforce stronger security controls and minimize the
  attack surface.
description: The rule checks for the presence of API access keys associated with root
  or owner accounts in IBM Cloud's account settings, ensuring they are not used. This
  practice enhances security by promoting the principle of least privilege, reducing
  the risk of substantial data breaches and unauthorized activities. Implementing
  this rule aids in maintaining compliance with security standards and frameworks
  that require strict access control measures, ultimately protecting critical resources
  and maintaining operational integrity.
