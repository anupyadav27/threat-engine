rule_id: ibm.iam.access_group.rbac_external_sharing_restricted_where_supported
title: Restrict External Sharing for Access Groups in IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Restricting external sharing of access groups is crucial for maintaining
  control over sensitive resources and data. By limiting external sharing, organizations
  can prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches, safeguarding both business
  operations and customer trust.
description: This rule ensures that external sharing of access groups is restricted
  wherever supported by the IBM Cloud IAM service. By enforcing this restriction,
  organizations can minimize exposure to unauthorized entities, thus enhancing the
  overall security posture. Implementing this control helps in compliance with data
  protection regulations by ensuring that only authorized users within the organization
  have access to critical resources, reducing the risk of data leaks and potential
  legal implications.
