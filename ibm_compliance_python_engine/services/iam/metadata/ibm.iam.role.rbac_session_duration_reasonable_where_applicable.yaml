title: Ensure Reasonable Session Duration for IAM Role-Based Access Control
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Setting a reasonable session duration for IAM roles is crucial to mitigate
  the risk of unauthorized access through stale sessions. Prolonged sessions can be
  exploited by malicious actors if a user's credentials are compromised. By enforcing
  appropriate session duration, organizations can enhance their security posture,
  ensuring that access is granted only for the necessary time frame, thereby reducing
  the potential attack surface.
description: This rule checks that the session duration for IAM roles within IBM Cloud
  is configured to be reasonable and appropriate based on organizational security
  policies. By limiting the session duration, it ensures that authenticated sessions
  are automatically terminated after a set period of inactivity, reducing the risk
  of unauthorized access. This practice not only strengthens security but also aids
  in compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate strict access
  controls and session management. Adopting such measures enhances accountability
  and reduces the likelihood of privilege misuse.
