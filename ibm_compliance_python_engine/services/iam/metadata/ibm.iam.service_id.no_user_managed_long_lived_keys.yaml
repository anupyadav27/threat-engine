rule_id: ibm.iam.service_id.no_user_managed_long_lived_keys
title: Enforce No User-Managed Long-Lived Keys for Service IDs
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that user-managed long-lived keys are not utilized for Service
  IDs significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Long-lived keys, if compromised, can provide persistent access to cloud resources,
  undermining security policies and potentially leading to costly security incidents
  and compliance violations.
description: This rule checks for the existence of user-managed long-lived keys associated
  with IBM Cloud Service IDs, ensuring that they are not in use. By enforcing this
  rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by minimizing the attack
  surface and ensuring that only short-lived or system-managed keys are used, aligning
  with best practices for key management and identity and access management. This
  approach supports compliance with security standards by ensuring that only secure,
  ephemeral credentials are used for authentication, thus reducing the risk of key
  compromise and unauthorized access.
