title: Enforce Complex Password Policies for Enhanced Account Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing a password policy that mandates the use of upper-case letters,
  lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters is crucial for strengthening
  account security. Such complexity reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access
  through common password cracking techniques, ultimately safeguarding sensitive data
  and maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule ensures that IBM Cloud account settings enforce a password
  policy requiring users to create complex passwords, including upper and lower-case
  letters, numbers, and special characters. By checking and enforcing this policy,
  organizations can significantly enhance the security of user accounts against unauthorized
  access. It aligns with security best practices and compliance mandates, helping
  businesses protect critical assets and reduce the risk of security breaches due
  to weak passwords.
