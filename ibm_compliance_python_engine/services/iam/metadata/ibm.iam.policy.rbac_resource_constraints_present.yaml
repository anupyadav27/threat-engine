title: Enforce RBAC Resource Constraints in IAM Policies
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring RBAC resource constraints are present in IAM policies is vital
  for limiting access to cloud resources based on specific roles and conditions. This
  practice helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches
  by ensuring that users only have the permissions necessary for their roles. Implementing
  these constraints can reduce the risk of privilege escalation and enhance overall
  security posture.
description: This rule checks whether IAM policies in IBM Cloud incorporate resource
  constraints as part of their role-based access control (RBAC) configurations. By
  requiring resource constraints, organizations can enforce fine-grained access control,
  ensuring that permissions are scoped to the minimum necessary resources. This improves
  security by adhering to the principle of least privilege and supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements by demonstrating controlled access to sensitive data
  and resources. Additionally, it helps maintain auditability and transparency in
  access management processes.
