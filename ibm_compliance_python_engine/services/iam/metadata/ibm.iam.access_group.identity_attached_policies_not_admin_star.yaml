rule_id: ibm.iam.access_group.identity_attached_policies_not_admin_star
title: Restrict Admin Star Policies in IAM Access Groups
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that IAM access groups do not have overly permissive admin-level
  permissions is crucial to maintaining a secure environment. Admin star policies
  (`*`) can grant excessive access, increasing the risk of unauthorized actions and
  potential data breaches. Limiting such permissions helps protect sensitive resources
  and adheres to the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface.
description: This rule checks IAM access groups for identity-attached policies that
  grant admin-level permissions using a wildcard (`*`). By identifying and restricting
  these policies, organizations can prevent unauthorized access and operations that
  could compromise system integrity. Implementing this rule helps align with security
  best practices, increases control over IAM configurations, and supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements by ensuring access is granted only to those who truly
  need it.
