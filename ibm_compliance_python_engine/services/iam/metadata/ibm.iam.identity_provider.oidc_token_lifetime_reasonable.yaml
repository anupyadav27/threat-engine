rule_id: ibm.iam.identity_provider.oidc_token_lifetime_reasonable
title: Ensure OIDC Token Lifetime is Appropriately Configured
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring a reasonable lifetime for OIDC tokens is essential to minimize
  security risks associated with token misuse and unauthorized access. Shorter token
  lifetimes reduce the window of opportunity for compromised tokens to be exploited
  by attackers, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the system. Proper
  token management aligns with compliance requirements, safeguarding sensitive data
  and maintaining trust with users and stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that the OpenID Connect (OIDC) token lifetime for
  identity providers in IBM Cloud is set to a reasonable duration, typically not exceeding
  recommended industry standards, such as one hour. By enforcing a shorter token validity
  period, this rule helps mitigate the risk of token hijacking and replay attacks,
  while also ensuring timely revocation of access when necessary. Implementing this
  control supports adherence to security best practices and regulatory requirements,
  fostering a robust identity and access management framework.
