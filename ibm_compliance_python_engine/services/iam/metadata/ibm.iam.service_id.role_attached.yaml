rule_id: ibm.iam.service_id.role_attached
title: Ensuring Service IDs Have Appropriate Role Attachments in IAM
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Attaching roles to service IDs in IAM is crucial for maintaining secure
  and efficient access control within IBM Cloud environments. Without appropriate
  role assignments, service IDs may have either excessive permissions, leading to
  potential misuse or insufficient permissions, hindering necessary operations. Ensuring
  correct role attachment aids in minimizing security risks and aligns with best practices
  for identity and access management.
description: This rule verifies that all service IDs within the IBM Cloud IAM framework
  have roles correctly attached, ensuring they are granted permissions aligned with
  their intended purpose. By checking for role attachments, this rule helps prevent
  unauthorized access and privilege escalation, enforcing a principle of least privilege.
  Proper role assignment not only enhances the security posture by restricting access
  to resources but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements by ensuring accountability and traceability of actions performed by
  service IDs.
