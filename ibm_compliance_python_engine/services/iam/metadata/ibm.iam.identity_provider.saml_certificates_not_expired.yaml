rule_id: ibm.iam.identity_provider.saml_certificates_not_expired
title: Ensure SAML Certificates Are Valid and Not Expired
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that SAML certificates are valid and not expired is crucial for
  maintaining secure authentication processes within an organization's IBM Cloud environment.
  Expired certificates can lead to authentication failures, potential security breaches,
  and unauthorized access, impacting both operational efficiency and business continuity.
  Regular validation of these certificates helps mitigate risks associated with identity
  spoofing and ensures compliance with security standards.
description: This rule verifies that the SAML certificates used by identity providers
  within IBM Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service are current and
  not expired. The rule checks the expiration date of each SAML certificate to ensure
  they are within the valid date range. By ensuring that SAML certificates are not
  expired, organizations can maintain a secure authentication framework, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing overall cloud security posture. Implementing
  this check also aligns with compliance requirements, as it supports best practices
  for identity and access management by ensuring that only authenticated and approved
  users can access cloud resources.
