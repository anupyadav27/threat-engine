title: Enforce Org-Wide Multi-Factor Authentication for Tenant Console Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for tenant console access
  is critical to safeguarding sensitive organizational data against unauthorized access.
  It adds an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of credential theft and helping
  to protect against potential security breaches that could lead to financial loss
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule ensures that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled across
  the organization for accessing the IBM Cloud Tenant Console. It verifies that account
  settings require MFA for all users, thus fortifying the authentication process by
  requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password. Enforcing MFA helps
  mitigate the risk of compromised credentials and aligns with industry best practices
  for identity and access management. Compliance with this rule supports organizational
  adherence to regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which often
  mandate robust authentication mechanisms.
