title: Ensure Identity Membership Review is Enabled for Access Groups
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling Identity Membership Review for access groups is crucial to maintaining
  a secure and compliant cloud environment. This practice ensures that only authorized
  users retain access to sensitive resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches. Regularly reviewing group memberships helps organizations
  adhere to compliance requirements and industry best practices, minimizing security
  vulnerabilities.
description: This rule checks whether Identity Membership Review is enabled for access
  groups within IBM Cloud IAM. By requiring periodic reviews, organizations can confirm
  that group memberships are up-to-date and that access is restricted to valid users
  only. This proactive measure enhances security by identifying and revoking unnecessary
  or outdated access, thereby reducing the attack surface. Furthermore, it supports
  compliance with standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR by demonstrating a commitment
  to access control and data protection.
