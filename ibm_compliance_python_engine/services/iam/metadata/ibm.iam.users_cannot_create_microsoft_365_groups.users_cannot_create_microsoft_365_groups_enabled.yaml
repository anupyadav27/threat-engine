title: Prevent User-Creation of Microsoft 365 Groups for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling user-initiated creation of Microsoft 365 Groups is crucial to
  maintaining a controlled environment, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access,
  and preventing data sprawl. This measure ensures that group creation is managed
  through established protocols and oversight, thereby reducing the chance of security
  breaches and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
description: This rule ensures that users within the IBM Cloud Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) framework are restricted from independently creating Microsoft
  365 Groups. By enforcing this policy, organizations can centralize the management
  of group creation, thereby maintaining a more organized and secure directory structure.
  This control is part of a broader identity and access management strategy that helps
  in minimizing security vulnerabilities and ensuring alignment with compliance standards
  like GDPR and HIPAA, which require stringent access controls and data protection
  measures.
