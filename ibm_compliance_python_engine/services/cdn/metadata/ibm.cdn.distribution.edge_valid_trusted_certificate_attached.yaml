title: Ensure Valid Trusted Certificate for CDN Edge Distribution
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Valid trusted certificates are essential for securing data in transit,
  ensuring that communications between users and CDN edge servers are encrypted and
  protected against interception. Utilizing trusted certificates strengthens user
  trust and helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, thereby safeguarding sensitive
  data and maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether a valid trusted certificate is attached to the
  CDN distribution edge, ensuring that all data transmitted to and from the CDN is
  encrypted using industry-standard protocols. By enforcing the use of trusted certificates,
  this rule enhances data protection and privacy by securing the integrity and confidentiality
  of the data in transit. Compliance with this rule helps organizations meet regulatory
  requirements for data protection and encryption, such as those prescribed by GDPR
  and PCI DSS.
