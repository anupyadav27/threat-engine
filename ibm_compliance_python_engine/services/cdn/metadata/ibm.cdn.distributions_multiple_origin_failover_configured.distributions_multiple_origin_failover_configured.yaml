title: Ensure Multi-Origin Failover for CDN Distributions
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Configuring multiple origin failover for CDN distributions enhances service
  availability and performance by automatically rerouting traffic to secondary origins
  when the primary origin fails. This setup minimizes downtime and ensures continuous
  content delivery, crucial for maintaining customer trust and business continuity
  in the event of server or network issues.
description: This rule verifies that CDN distributions are configured with multiple
  origin failover settings. By ensuring that there are backup origins in place, the
  CDN can seamlessly redirect traffic to alternate origins if the primary origin becomes
  unavailable. This not only boosts resilience against disruptions but also aligns
  with best practices for disaster recovery and business continuity planning. Implementing
  such configurations helps organizations meet compliance requirements related to
  availability and disaster recovery strategies.
