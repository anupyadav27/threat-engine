rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.distributions_using_deprecated_ssl_protocols_required
title: Enforce Modern SSL Protocols for Secure CDN Distributions
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Utilizing deprecated SSL protocols in CDN distributions can expose sensitive
  data to interception and exploitation by cyber adversaries. Modern SSL protocols
  ensure robust encryption, protecting data integrity and confidentiality. This practice
  not only mitigates security risks but also meets industry compliance standards,
  safeguarding business reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule checks if CDN distributions are using deprecated SSL protocols,
  such as SSLv3 or TLS 1.0, which are vulnerable to various attacks, including POODLE
  and BEAST. By enforcing the use of modern protocols like TLS 1.2 or higher, this
  rule enhances the security posture of data in transit, reducing the risk of data
  breaches. Compliance with this rule ensures alignment with security best practices
  and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and PCI DSS, promoting a secure cloud
  environment.
