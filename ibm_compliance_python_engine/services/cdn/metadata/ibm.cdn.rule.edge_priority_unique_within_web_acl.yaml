title: Ensure Unique Edge Priority for Rules Within Web ACL in IBM CDN
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Assigning a unique edge priority to each rule within a Web ACL is crucial
  for preventing conflicts and ensuring predictable rule execution. This enhances
  security by ensuring that the most critical rules are evaluated first, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Consistent rule prioritization
  supports business continuity by maintaining the integrity of security configurations.
description: This rule checks that each rule within an IBM Cloud CDN Web Access Control
  List (ACL) has a distinct edge priority. By enforcing unique priority levels, the
  rule ensures that there is no ambiguity in rule execution order, which is essential
  for effective threat prevention and mitigation strategies. This practice not only
  improves the security posture by allowing precise control over traffic filtering
  and access policies but also aids in compliance with industry standards that require
  structured and auditable access control mechanisms.
