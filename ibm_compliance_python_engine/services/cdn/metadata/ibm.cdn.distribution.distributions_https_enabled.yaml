rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.distributions_https_enabled
title: Ensure HTTPS is Enabled for All IBM CDN Distributions
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling HTTPS for CDN distributions ensures that data is encrypted during
  transit, protecting sensitive information from interception or tampering by malicious
  actors. This is critical for maintaining customer trust and adhering to regulatory
  requirements for data protection, thereby minimizing potential legal liabilities
  and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all CDN distributions on IBM Cloud have HTTPS
  enabled, ensuring secure communication between clients and servers. Enforcing HTTPS
  encrypts data in transit, thereby safeguarding it against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
  attacks. By complying with this rule, organizations enhance their security posture
  and align with compliance frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate
  secure data transmission practices.
