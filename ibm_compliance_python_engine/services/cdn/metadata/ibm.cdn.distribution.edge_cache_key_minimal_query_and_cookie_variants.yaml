title: Optimize Edge Cache Key for Secure CDN Data Handling
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Proper configuration of edge cache keys in a CDN is crucial for maintaining
  data security and privacy. By minimizing query and cookie variants, this rule helps
  prevent unauthorized data access and reduces the risk of cache poisoning attacks,
  which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. Ensuring optimal cache
  behavior not only enhances security but also improves performance and reliability,
  directly impacting business continuity and customer trust.
description: This rule checks the configuration of CDN distribution settings to ensure
  that edge cache keys are optimized by using minimal query and cookie variants. By
  limiting the number of variants, this setting reduces the attack surface, thereby
  enhancing data protection and privacy. It ensures that sensitive data is not inadvertently
  exposed through cache inconsistencies and aligns with industry best practices for
  encryption at rest. Compliance with this rule helps organizations adhere to data
  protection regulations and standards, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized
  access.
