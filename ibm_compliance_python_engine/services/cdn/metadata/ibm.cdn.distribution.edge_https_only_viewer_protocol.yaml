title: Enforce HTTPS-Only Protocol for CDN Edge Distributions
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that CDN edge distributions use HTTPS-only protocols is critical
  for safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality as it travels over the network.
  By enforcing HTTPS, organizations can protect sensitive data from being intercepted
  by malicious actors, thereby maintaining customer trust and adhering to industry
  compliance standards.
description: This rule verifies that CDN distributions on IBM Cloud are configured
  to allow only HTTPS connections from viewers. Implementing HTTPS-only connections
  prevents data from being transmitted in plain text, reducing the risk of data breaches
  and man-in-the-middle attacks. It enhances security posture by ensuring encrypted
  communication and aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and PCI DSS,
  which mandate secure data transmission practices.
