rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.distributions_logging_enabled
title: Ensure CDN Distribution Logging is Enabled for Enhanced Auditability
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for CDN distributions is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into the access and usage patterns of distributed content. It helps in quickly identifying
  unauthorized access attempts and potential data breaches. Moreover, logging aids
  in forensic investigations and supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  by providing a detailed audit trail of CDN activities.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for CDN distributions, ensuring
  that all requests and responses are recorded and can be analyzed for security incidents.
  Enabling logging provides a comprehensive view of CDN operations, facilitating the
  detection of anomalies and unauthorized activities. This practice not only enhances
  security posture by enabling proactive threat detection but also supports compliance
  efforts by maintaining an accurate record of content distribution activities, which
  is vital for audits and regulatory reviews.
