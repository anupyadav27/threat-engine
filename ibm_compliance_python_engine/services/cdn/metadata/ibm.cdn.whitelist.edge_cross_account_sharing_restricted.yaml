rule_id: ibm.cdn.whitelist.edge_cross_account_sharing_restricted
title: Restrict Edge Cross Account Sharing in IBM Cloud CDN Whitelists
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Limiting cross-account sharing of CDN resources is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and securing sensitive information against unauthorized access. By
  ensuring that only designated accounts can interact with content delivery networks,
  businesses can minimize potential data leaks and unauthorized content distribution,
  thus protecting their brand reputation and ensuring regulatory compliance.
description: This rule checks whether edge cross-account sharing is restricted in
  the CDN whitelists, a critical measure to enhance security by ensuring that only
  pre-approved accounts can access or modify the CDN configurations. By enforcing
  such restrictions, organizations can prevent accidental or malicious exposure of
  CDN resources to unauthorized entities. This practice not only strengthens the security
  posture of the organization's cloud environment but also aligns with compliance
  mandates that require stringent access controls for data distribution channels.
