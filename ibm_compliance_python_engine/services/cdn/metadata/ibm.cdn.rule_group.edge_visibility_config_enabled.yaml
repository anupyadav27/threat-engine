title: Ensure Edge Visibility Configuration is Enabled for CDN Rule Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling edge visibility configuration for CDN rule groups enhances your
  ability to monitor and analyze traffic patterns at the edge of your content delivery
  network. This is crucial for identifying potential security threats and ensuring
  compliance with data governance policies. By maintaining visibility at the edge,
  businesses can promptly respond to anomalies, thereby minimizing the risk of data
  breaches and ensuring a secure user experience.
description: This rule checks whether the edge visibility configuration is enabled
  for CDN rule groups within IBM Cloud. By enabling this feature, organizations can
  gain insights into the traffic and usage patterns at the edge nodes of their CDN,
  which is essential for effective security monitoring and incident response. This
  not only helps in detecting and mitigating potential threats early but also supports
  compliance with various security standards by providing detailed traffic logs that
  can be audited. Enabling edge visibility is a proactive measure that strengthens
  the overall security posture and governance of cloud resources.
