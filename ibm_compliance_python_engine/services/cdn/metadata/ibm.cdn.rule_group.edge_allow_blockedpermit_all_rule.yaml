title: Ensure CDN Edge Rules Permit Only Authorized Traffic
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: This rule is essential for preventing unauthorized access and mitigating
  potential security vulnerabilities by ensuring that only permitted traffic is allowed
  through the CDN edge. By implementing strict control over the traffic rules at the
  edge, businesses can reduce the risk of data breaches and maintain the integrity
  of their network services, which is crucial for sustaining customer trust and compliance
  with industry regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that the CDN edge configuration does not
  permit all traffic indiscriminately, which could expose the system to malicious
  activities. It checks for misconfigurations that might inadvertently allow access
  to blocked or unauthorized requests. By enforcing this rule, organizations can ensure
  a robust security posture by allowing only specific, authenticated requests to pass
  through, thereby enhancing the overall security monitoring and governance framework.
  This contributes to compliance with security standards by demonstrating controlled
  access measures.
