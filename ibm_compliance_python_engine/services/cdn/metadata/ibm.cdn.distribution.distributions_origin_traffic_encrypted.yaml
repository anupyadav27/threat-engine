rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.distributions_origin_traffic_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of CDN Distribution Origin Traffic
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting origin traffic in CDN distributions is crucial to protect sensitive
  data as it travels across networks. Without encryption, data can be intercepted
  and exposed to unauthorized parties, risking data breaches and compromising business
  integrity. Ensuring encrypted traffic enhances trust and meets compliance standards,
  safeguarding both company reputation and customer data.
description: This security rule checks whether the traffic between CDN distributions
  and their origins is encrypted using TLS protocols. By enforcing encryption, it
  ensures data confidentiality and integrity during transit, mitigating risks associated
  with data interception. Adhering to this rule not only enhances security but also
  aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for data protection
  and privacy, such as GDPR and CCPA. Implementing this rule is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks.
