rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.edge_origin_access_restricted
title: Secure Edge-Origin Access for IBM CDN Distributions
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Restricting access to the origin server from the CDN edge is crucial for
  preventing unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring that only
  legitimate requests from the CDN edge nodes reach the origin server, businesses
  can safeguard sensitive data, maintain service integrity, and protect against malicious
  attacks that could disrupt operations or compromise customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether access from CDN edge nodes to the origin servers
  is properly restricted and authenticated, ensuring that only approved edge nodes
  can retrieve content. Implementing such restrictions minimizes the risk of unauthorized
  data exposure and enhances the security posture of the CDN distribution. Adhering
  to this rule helps organizations align with industry best practices and compliance
  requirements for data protection and secure access management.
