title: Ensure Edge Cache Key Excludes Sensitive Headers in CDN Distributions
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Excluding sensitive headers from edge cache keys is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive data, which can lead to data breaches and compliance
  violations. This practice enhances data protection by ensuring that sensitive information
  is not inadvertently cached or exposed to unauthorized parties, thus maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of user data.
description: This rule verifies that sensitive headers are excluded from the edge
  cache keys in IBM Cloud CDN distributions. By doing so, it prevents potential exposure
  of confidential data through caching mechanisms. This measure is essential for maintaining
  robust data protection and privacy practices, as it ensures that sensitive information
  is not stored in edge cache, which could be accessed by unintended recipients. Implementing
  this rule supports compliance with data protection regulations and enhances the
  overall security posture of cloud environments by mitigating risks associated with
  data leakage.
