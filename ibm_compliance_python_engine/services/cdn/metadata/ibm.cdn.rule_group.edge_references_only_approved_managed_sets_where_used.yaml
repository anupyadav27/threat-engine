rule_id: ibm.cdn.rule_group.edge_references_only_approved_managed_sets_where_used
title: Enforce Use of Approved Managed Sets for CDN Edge References
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that only approved managed sets are used in CDN edge configurations
  is crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. This practice
  minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thereby protecting
  sensitive business information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule evaluates CDN configurations to verify that edge references
  are aligned with approved managed sets. By requiring the use of pre-approved sets,
  organizations can maintain consistent security controls and reduce vulnerabilities
  that arise from misconfigurations or unauthorized changes. Adhering to this standard
  not only enhances overall security posture but also supports compliance with industry
  regulations and organizational governance policies.
