rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.edge_access_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Edge Access Logging is Enabled for CDN Distributions
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Edge Access Logging for CDN distributions is crucial for maintaining
  visibility over access patterns and potential security threats. It aids in the detection
  of unauthorized access and anomalies by capturing detailed logs of requests made
  to the CDN, thereby supporting forensic analysis in the event of a security incident.
  Additionally, it enables organizations to meet compliance requirements by maintaining
  a reliable audit trail of access to their resources.
description: This rule verifies that Edge Access Logging is activated for all CDN
  distributions within the IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring logging is enabled,
  organizations can monitor and analyze traffic to their content delivery networks,
  identifying unusual or unauthorized access attempts. This logging capability is
  essential for compliance with industry standards that mandate audit logging and
  contributes to a strong security posture by allowing for continuous monitoring and
  alerting on suspicious activities. Furthermore, comprehensive logging supports incident
  response efforts and assists in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of
  distributed content.
