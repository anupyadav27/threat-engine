rule_id: ibm.cdn.origin.edge_forward_headers_minimal
title: Ensure Minimal Edge Forward Headers in IBM CDN Configuration
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Minimizing edge forward headers in CDN configurations is essential for
  reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information about the client or the internal
  network. This practice enhances privacy and security by ensuring that only necessary
  headers are passed to the origin server, thereby preventing data leakage and reducing
  the attack surface. Businesses benefit from improved compliance with data protection
  regulations and an overall stronger security posture.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM CDN configuration for the origin resource
  uses minimal edge forward headers. By limiting the headers, the rule helps prevent
  inadvertent exposure of potentially sensitive information through HTTP headers as
  requests are proxied from edge servers to origin servers. Implementing this security
  measure not only strengthens data privacy but also aligns with best practices for
  minimizing the risk of data breaches. Compliance with this rule supports adherence
  to industry standards and regulatory requirements related to data protection and
  privacy.
