title: Restrict Query Headers and Cookies for CDN Edge Cache Behavior
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Limiting the query headers and cookies that are allowed at the CDN edge
  is crucial for reducing the attack surface of your application. By only permitting
  essential query parameters and cookies, you minimize the risk of exposing sensitive
  information and prevent malicious users from exploiting these vectors to manipulate
  cache behavior, ensuring data integrity and enhancing user privacy.
description: This rule ensures that the CDN edge only processes a minimal set of query
  headers and cookies, aligning with security best practices by reducing unnecessary
  data exposure. It examines the configuration of cache behavior rules to verify that
  only essential headers and cookies are allowed, which helps in minimizing potential
  vulnerabilities. Implementing this control can enhance security monitoring, mitigate
  the risk of cache poisoning attacks, and ensure compliance with data protection
  standards by preventing the leakage of sensitive information through edge caches.
