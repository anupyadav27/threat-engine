rule_id: ibm.cdn.cache_behavior.edge_no_sensitive_headers_cached
title: Prevent Caching of Sensitive Headers at CDN Edge
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that sensitive headers are not cached at the CDN edge is crucial
  to maintaining data privacy and security. Caching sensitive information can lead
  to unauthorized access and exposure of confidential data, potentially resulting
  in compliance violations and reputational damage for the organization.
description: This rule checks the configuration of CDN cache behaviors to verify that
  sensitive headers are not cached at the edge. By preventing the caching of sensitive
  headers, this rule helps protect sensitive information from being inadvertently
  exposed to unauthorized users. Adhering to this rule enhances security by ensuring
  that only non-sensitive data is stored in cache, thus reducing the risk of data
  breaches. It also aids in compliance with data protection regulations by ensuring
  that confidential information is not improperly stored or accessed.
