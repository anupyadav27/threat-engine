title: Ensure Field-Level Encryption for CDN Distributions is Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling field-level encryption for CDN distributions is critical for safeguarding
  sensitive data as it traverses the network. This approach adds an additional layer
  of security by ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable
  without the appropriate decryption keys. Implementing this control helps organizations
  mitigate the risk of data breaches and maintain customer trust, while also aligning
  with regulatory compliance requirements regarding data protection.
description: This rule checks whether field-level encryption is enabled for IBM Cloud
  CDN distributions, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted at the field level
  before being transmitted across the network. By doing so, it prevents unauthorized
  access to specific data fields, even if the data is intercepted during transmission.
  This practice enhances the overall security posture by providing fine-grained encryption
  control, helping organizations comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA. Enforcing field-level encryption supports a robust data protection strategy,
  minimizing the risk of data exposure and demonstrating a commitment to privacy.
