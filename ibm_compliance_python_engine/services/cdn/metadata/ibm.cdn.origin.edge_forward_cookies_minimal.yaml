title: Enforce Minimal Edge Forward Cookies for IBM CDN Origins
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing minimal edge forward cookies enhances security by reducing
  the risk of sensitive data exposure through unnecessary cookie forwarding. This
  approach mitigates potential attack vectors, such as cross-site scripting or cookie
  theft, by limiting the data shared between clients and CDN origins. It also aligns
  with best practices for data privacy and regulatory compliance, minimizing the attack
  surface and safeguarding user information.
description: This rule checks that the CDN configuration for IBM Cloud origins is
  set to forward minimal cookies to the edge. By ensuring that only essential cookies
  are passed through, this configuration minimizes the risk of leaking sensitive information
  and reduces the potential for exploitation via cookie-based attacks. Adhering to
  this rule supports compliance with privacy regulations and security frameworks by
  ensuring that only necessary data is transmitted, thereby enhancing overall data
  protection and governance.
