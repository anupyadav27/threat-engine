title: Ensure CDN Edge Respects Cache-Control for No-Store and Private Data
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that CDN edge nodes respect cache-control headers for 'no-store'
  and 'private' directives is crucial for maintaining data privacy and compliance
  with data protection regulations. By adhering to these headers, sensitive information
  is not cached at the edge, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches,
  and ensuring that user privacy is upheld.
description: This rule verifies that the cache behavior settings for CDN edge nodes
  respect the 'no-store' and 'private' cache-control directives. When configured correctly,
  edge servers will not store sensitive data that is marked with these headers, thus
  preventing potential exposure of private information. This enhances security by
  ensuring compliance with privacy standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate strict control over the storage and dissemination of personal data.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to protecting
  user data and minimizing the risk of data leakage.
