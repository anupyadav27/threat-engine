rule_id: ibm.cdn.rule.edge_regex_set_no_overly_broad_patterns
title: Ensure Specificity in Edge Regex Patterns for CDN Rules
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Utilizing overly broad regex patterns in CDN rules can inadvertently expose
  sensitive resources or reduce the efficacy of security measures. Such patterns may
  allow unintended access to critical data, posing a risk to both data integrity and
  confidentiality. Maintaining precise regex patterns not only enhances security posture
  but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks for the presence of overly broad patterns in edge regex
  sets used within CDN configurations. By ensuring that regex patterns are specific
  and not overly inclusive, the rule helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive
  resources and limits access to only intended endpoints. This precision in regex
  patterns contributes to a robust security strategy by minimizing attack surfaces
  and ensuring alignment with compliance requirements such as GDPR and PCI-DSS.
