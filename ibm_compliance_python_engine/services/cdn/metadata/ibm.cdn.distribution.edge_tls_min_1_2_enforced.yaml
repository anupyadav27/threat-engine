title: Ensure Edge TLS 1.2 Minimum for CDN Distributions
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing a minimum of TLS 1.2 for CDN edge distributions is crucial for
  securing data in transit, protecting against vulnerabilities associated with older
  TLS versions, and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data. This practice
  helps mitigate potential threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive customer information and maintaining trust in your digital services.
description: This rule checks that all CDN distributions enforce a minimum TLS version
  of 1.2 at the edge. By ensuring that only TLS 1.2 or higher is supported, organizations
  enhance the security of data transmitted between clients and CDN edges. This approach
  not only aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for data
  protection but also ensures compatibility with modern browsers and client systems.
  Implementing this security measure reduces the risk of data breaches and supports
  compliance with standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR, which require robust encryption
  protocols.
