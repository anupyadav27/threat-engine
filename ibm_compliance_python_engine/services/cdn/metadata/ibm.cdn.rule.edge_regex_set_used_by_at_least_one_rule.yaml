title: Ensure Edge Regex Set is Utilized by at Least One CDN Rule
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Utilizing Edge Regex Sets in CDN rules is crucial for enhancing security
  and optimizing content delivery. By ensuring that these regex sets are employed,
  organizations can effectively manage and filter requests, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and improving content distribution efficiency. This practice helps maintain
  compliance with security standards and protects business assets from potential threats.
description: This rule checks if the Edge Regex Set in IBM Cloud's Content Delivery
  Network (CDN) is being used by at least one rule. The presence of an active Edge
  Regex Set helps in creating precise request filtering patterns, which can block
  malicious requests and allow only legitimate traffic. Implementing this practice
  not only strengthens the security posture by controlling access to resources but
  also aligns with governance policies and compliance requirements, ensuring that
  the organization meets industry-standard security guidelines.
