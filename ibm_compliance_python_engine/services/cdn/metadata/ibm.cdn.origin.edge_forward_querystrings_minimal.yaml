title: Enforce Minimal Edge Forwarding of Query Strings for CDN Origins
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Minimizing the forwarding of query strings from the edge to the origin
  server is crucial for reducing unnecessary data exposure and limiting potential
  attack vectors. By controlling which query strings are forwarded, organizations
  can mitigate the risk of leaking sensitive information and ensure better performance
  and efficiency of content delivery networks (CDN). This practice supports adherence
  to data privacy regulations and enhances overall system security.
description: This rule verifies that the CDN configuration for origin resources enforces
  minimal forwarding of query strings from edge servers. By restricting the number
  of query strings passed from the edge to the origin, organizations can prevent exposing
  sensitive data inadvertently and reduce the potential for query-based attacks. Implementing
  this rule aligns with best practices for securing web applications and supports
  compliance requirements by limiting data handling to the minimum necessary. This
  approach contributes to a more secure, efficient, and compliant cloud environment.
