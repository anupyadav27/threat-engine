title: Enforce Edge HSTS for Enhanced CDN Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Edge HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is crucial for protecting
  data exchanged between clients and CDN edge servers. It prevents protocol downgrade
  attacks and cookie hijacking by ensuring that browsers only interact with the server
  over secure HTTPS connections. This enhances user trust and minimizes the risk of
  data breaches, aligning with best practices in data security and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that Edge HSTS is enabled for IBM Cloud CDN distributions,
  ensuring secure data transmission. By enforcing HSTS, browsers are directed to use
  HTTPS, thus protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring the integrity
  and confidentiality of data in transit. It also helps organizations comply with
  security mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data protection measures.
  Implementing this rule supports a stronger security posture by automatically redirecting
  all HTTP requests to HTTPS at the edge level, mitigating potential attack vectors.
