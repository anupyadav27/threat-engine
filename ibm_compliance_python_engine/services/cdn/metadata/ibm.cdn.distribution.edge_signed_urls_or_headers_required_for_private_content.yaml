rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.edge_signed_urls_or_headers_required_for_private_content
title: Enforce Edge Signed URLs/Headers for Private CDN Content
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that edge signed URLs or headers are required for accessing private
  content in a CDN distribution is crucial for maintaining secure access control.
  This security measure prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data by verifying
  requests at the edge, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance
  with data protection standards.
description: This rule checks whether edge signed URLs or headers are mandated for
  accessing private content within a CDN distribution. By implementing this security
  control, organizations can ensure that only authenticated requests are allowed to
  retrieve protected resources, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
  This practice enhances the security posture by enforcing strict access controls,
  aligning with industry best practices for network security and access management.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with regulatory requirements for the protection
  of sensitive data in transit.
