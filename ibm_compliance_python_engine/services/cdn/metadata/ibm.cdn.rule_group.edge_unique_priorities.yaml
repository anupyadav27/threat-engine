title: Ensure Unique Priorities in IBM Cloud CDN Rule Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Unique priorities within CDN rule groups are crucial to maintaining the
  integrity and predictability of content delivery rules. Overlapping or conflicting
  priorities can lead to unintended behaviors, potentially exposing sensitive data
  or disrupting service delivery. Clear prioritization supports both security and
  operational efficiency, mitigating risks of misconfiguration.
description: This rule checks that each rule within an IBM Cloud Content Delivery
  Network (CDN) rule group has a unique priority value. Ensuring distinct priorities
  prevents conflicts between rules, which could otherwise lead to security vulnerabilities
  such as unauthorized data access or service disruptions. By enforcing unique priorities,
  organizations can enhance compliance with governance frameworks that demand clear
  access control mechanisms and operational transparency, supporting robust security
  monitoring and management.
