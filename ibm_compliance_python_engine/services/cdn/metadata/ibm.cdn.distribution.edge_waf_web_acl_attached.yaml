title: Ensure Edge WAF Web ACL is Attached to CDN Distributions
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Web ACL to a CDN distribution
  is crucial for protecting web applications from common threats and vulnerabilities,
  such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Implementing a WAF helps in maintaining
  data integrity and confidentiality by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between
  the internet and the application. This measure not only enhances security posture
  but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule checks that a Web ACL is attached to CDN distributions within
  IBM Cloud. The Web ACL acts as a filter for incoming web traffic, allowing only
  legitimate requests while blocking malicious traffic. By enforcing this security
  measure, organizations can protect their web applications from a variety of attack
  vectors, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and service disruptions. Additionally,
  aligning with compliance frameworks, such as PCI DSS and GDPR, is facilitated by
  implementing these security controls, as they require effective monitoring and protection
  of data in transit.
