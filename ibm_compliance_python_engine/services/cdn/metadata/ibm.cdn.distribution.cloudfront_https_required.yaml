rule_id: ibm.cdn.distribution.cloudfront_https_required
title: Enforce HTTPS for Secure IBM Cloud CDN Distribution
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that CloudFront distributions are configured to require HTTPS
  is crucial for protecting data in transit. HTTPS encrypts data exchanged between
  clients and servers, safeguarding sensitive information from interception and tampering.
  This practice is vital for maintaining customer trust and complying with data protection
  regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that all IBM Cloud CDN distributions are
  configured to enforce HTTPS protocols. By requiring HTTPS, this rule ensures that
  communications between clients and your content delivery network are encrypted,
  thus mitigating risks of data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. Implementing
  HTTPS not only enhances the overall security posture but also aligns with industry
  standards and compliance requirements, such as GDPR and PCI DSS, ensuring that sensitive
  customer data is adequately protected.
