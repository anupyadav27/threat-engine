title: Ensure CDN Edge Whitelist is Configured for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring a whitelist for CDN edge servers is crucial for maintaining
  a secure content delivery network. This practice helps mitigate unauthorized access
  and potential attacks by ensuring that only trusted IP addresses are allowed to
  interact with your CDN resources. By managing access controls, businesses can prevent
  data breaches and ensure compliance with industry standards.
description: The rule checks if the whitelist for CDN edge servers is populated, ensuring
  that only specified IP addresses can access the CDN resources. This configuration
  enhances security by limiting the exposure of your content delivery network to potentially
  malicious traffic. By implementing a whitelist, organizations can maintain strict
  access controls, which is a fundamental aspect of security governance and compliance
  with regulatory requirements. Regularly updating and monitoring the whitelist can
  further enhance security posture by adapting to changing access needs and threat
  landscapes.
