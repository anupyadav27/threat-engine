rule_id: ibm.cdn.origin.edge_no_secret_headers_forwarded
title: Prevent Forwarding of Secret Headers from CDN Edge to Origin Servers
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: This rule is crucial to protect sensitive information such as API keys,
  authentication tokens, or other confidential headers from being inadvertently exposed
  during transmission from CDN edge servers to origin servers. Forwarding secret headers
  can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial and reputational
  damage. Ensuring these headers are not forwarded helps maintain the integrity and
  confidentiality of sensitive data.
description: This security rule checks the configuration of IBM Cloud CDN services
  to ensure that no secret headers are forwarded from edge servers to origin servers.
  By preventing such headers from being transmitted, this rule helps mitigate the
  risk of exposing sensitive data to unauthorized parties. It enhances security by
  adhering to the principle of least privilege and supports compliance with data protection
  regulations by ensuring that sensitive information is not unnecessarily propagated
  across network boundaries.
