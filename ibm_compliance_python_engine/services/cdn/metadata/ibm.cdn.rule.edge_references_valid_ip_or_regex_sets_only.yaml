rule_id: ibm.cdn.rule.edge_references_valid_ip_or_regex_sets_only
title: Ensure Edge References Use Valid IP or Regex Sets in IBM CDN Rules
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: This rule is essential to maintain the integrity and security of content
  delivery networks (CDN) by ensuring that only valid IP addresses or regular expressions
  are used in edge references. By enforcing this practice, organizations can prevent
  unauthorized access and reduce the risk of data breaches, safeguarding sensitive
  information and maintaining customer trust.
description: The rule checks that all edge references within IBM CDN rules are configured
  using valid IP addresses or regex sets. This is crucial for defining precise and
  secure access controls, which help to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized
  data exposure. Implementing this rule aligns with compliance requirements by ensuring
  that access configurations adhere to best practices for network security and governance.
  It enhances the security posture by preventing misconfigurations that could lead
  to exposure of sensitive information or services to the public internet.
