rule_id: ibm.cdn.whitelist.edge_used_by_at_least_one_rule
title: Ensure CDN Whitelist Edge is Associated with at Least One Rule
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that CDN whitelist edges are used by at least one rule is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and streamlined content delivery network. Unused whitelist
  entries can lead to misconfigurations and potential security loopholes, thereby
  increasing the risk of unauthorized access. By associating whitelists with rules,
  organizations can ensure that only intended traffic is permitted, aligning with
  best practices for data security and governance.
description: This rule verifies that each CDN whitelist edge is actively used by at
  least one security rule. By implementing this check, organizations can prevent orphaned
  whitelist entries that could otherwise lead to inadvertent exposure of network resources.
  This practice not only enhances the security posture of the CDN but also aids in
  maintaining compliance with industry regulations by ensuring that access controls
  are properly enforced and documented. Regular monitoring and validation of whitelist
  usage is a proactive measure in strengthening security governance.
