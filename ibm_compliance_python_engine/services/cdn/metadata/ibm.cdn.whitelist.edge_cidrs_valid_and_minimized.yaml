title: Ensure Valid and Minimized Edge CIDRs in CDN Whitelist
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Maintaining a valid and minimized list of Edge CIDRs in your CDN whitelist
  is crucial for reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access to
  your content delivery network resources. By limiting the CIDRs to only those necessary
  for operational purposes, you enhance the resilience of your infrastructure and
  protect against potential security breaches that could disrupt business operations.
description: This rule checks that the Edge CIDRs in your CDN whitelist are not only
  valid but also minimized to include only essential addresses. By ensuring that only
  necessary IP ranges are allowed, the rule helps in reducing the likelihood of unauthorized
  access while maintaining efficient content distribution. Implementing this rule
  aids in achieving compliance with industry best practices for network security and
  promotes a robust security posture by preventing unnecessary exposure of network
  resources.
