rule_id: ibm.cdn.rule.edge_regex_set_not_empty
title: Ensure CDN Edge Regex Set is Configured to Enhance Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring the Edge Regex Set for CDN is crucial to filter and manage
  incoming traffic effectively. An empty regex set may result in inadequate filtering,
  potentially allowing malicious traffic that could exploit vulnerabilities and compromise
  data integrity. Ensuring these configurations are in place enhances the security
  posture, mitigates risks, and aligns with compliance requirements.
description: This rule evaluates the presence and configuration of regex patterns
  in the Edge Regex Set within IBM Cloud's CDN rule settings. It ensures that the
  set is not empty, thereby enabling administrators to implement traffic filtering
  and pattern matching effectively. By setting up appropriate regex configurations,
  organizations can prevent unauthorized access, minimize security threats, and maintain
  compliance with industry standards. This proactive measure helps in early detection
  of anomalies and reduces the attack surface by controlling the nature of traffic
  allowed to reach web applications.
