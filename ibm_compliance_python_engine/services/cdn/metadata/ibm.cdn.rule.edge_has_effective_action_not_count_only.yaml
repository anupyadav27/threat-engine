title: Ensure CDN Edge Rules Have Effective Actions Beyond Count Only
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that CDN edge rules have actionable measures beyond simply counting
  requests is crucial for maintaining robust security and compliance. Rules that only
  count traffic can miss opportunities to mitigate threats in real-time, potentially
  leaving the system vulnerable to attacks such as DDoS or unauthorized access, which
  can lead to data breaches and service disruptions.
description: This rule checks if CDN edge rules are configured to perform actions
  beyond just counting traffic, such as blocking or redirecting potentially malicious
  requests. By implementing effective actions, organizations can proactively manage
  security risks and enhance their defense mechanisms. This approach not only improves
  the overall security posture but also aids in meeting compliance requirements by
  demonstrating active threat mitigation efforts. It ensures that the CDN layer is
  not just passively monitoring but actively defending against threats.
