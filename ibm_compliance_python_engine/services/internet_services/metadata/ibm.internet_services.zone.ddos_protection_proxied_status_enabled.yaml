rule_id: ibm.internet_services.zone.ddos_protection_proxied_status_enabled
title: Ensure DDoS Protection Proxied Status is Enabled for Internet Services
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling DDoS protection with proxied status is crucial for safeguarding
  internet services against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This practice
  ensures that all incoming traffic is routed through a secure proxy, which can identify
  and mitigate malicious traffic patterns, thus protecting business operations from
  service disruptions and potential revenue loss.
description: This rule checks whether the DDoS protection proxied status is enabled
  for zones within IBM Cloud Internet Services. By ensuring this setting is active,
  the system can effectively shield web applications from DDoS attacks by scrutinizing
  and filtering incoming traffic through a proxy. This not only enhances the security
  posture by preventing malicious traffic from impacting the service but also aids
  in compliance with industry standards and regulations that require robust network
  security measures.
