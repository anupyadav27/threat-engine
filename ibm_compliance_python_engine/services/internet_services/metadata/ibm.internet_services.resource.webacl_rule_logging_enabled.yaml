title: Ensure WebACL Rule Logging is Enabled for IBM Internet Services
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for WebACL rules is crucial for maintaining the security
  and integrity of your applications by allowing you to monitor traffic patterns and
  detect potential threats. It provides visibility into the actions taken by your
  web application firewall, aids in forensic investigations, and supports compliance
  efforts by ensuring that all access attempts are recorded and auditable.
description: This security rule checks whether logging is enabled for WebACL rules
  within IBM Internet Services. By ensuring that logging is active, organizations
  can enhance their security posture by capturing detailed records of web traffic
  and firewall actions. This not only assists in identifying and mitigating security
  threats but also plays a vital role in meeting compliance requirements by providing
  an audit trail of access and actions. Enabling WebACL logging is a proactive measure
  to ensure continuous monitoring and alerting, integral to maintaining a robust security
  framework.
