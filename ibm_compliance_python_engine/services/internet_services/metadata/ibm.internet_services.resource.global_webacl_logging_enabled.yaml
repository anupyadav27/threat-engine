rule_id: ibm.internet_services.resource.global_webacl_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Global Web ACL Logging is Enabled for IBM Internet Services
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Global Web ACL logging is crucial for monitoring and analyzing
  web traffic, which helps in detecting and responding to potential security threats.
  Without logging, malicious activities such as unauthorized access attempts or data
  breaches might go unnoticed, leading to potential financial and reputational damage
  to the organization.
description: This rule checks whether Global Web ACL logging is enabled for IBM Internet
  Services resources. By enabling logging, all incoming and outgoing requests are
  recorded, providing a comprehensive audit trail. This enhances security by allowing
  real-time monitoring and retrospective analysis of traffic patterns, helping to
  identify suspicious activities. It also aids in meeting regulatory compliance requirements
  by maintaining detailed logs that can be used for audits and investigations.
