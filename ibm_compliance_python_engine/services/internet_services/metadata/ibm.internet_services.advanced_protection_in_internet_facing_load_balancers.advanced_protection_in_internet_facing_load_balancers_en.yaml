title: Ensure Advanced Protection for Internet-Facing Load Balancers
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling advanced protection for internet-facing load balancers is crucial
  as it enhances the security posture by mitigating potential threats such as Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and unauthorized access. This proactive measure
  safeguards critical business operations, ensuring service availability and minimizing
  the risk of data breaches, thereby maintaining customer trust and compliance with
  industry standards.
description: This security rule verifies that advanced protection features, such as
  DDoS mitigation and WAF (Web Application Firewall), are enabled for internet-facing
  load balancers within IBM Cloud Internet Services. By implementing these features,
  organizations can effectively monitor and block malicious traffic, protect against
  common web vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and
  PCI DSS. This setup not only fortifies the infrastructure against attacks but also
  provides robust analytics for threat intelligence and response.
