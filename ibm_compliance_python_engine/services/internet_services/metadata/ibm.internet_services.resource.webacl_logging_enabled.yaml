title: Ensure WebACL Logging is Enabled for IBM Internet Services
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling WebACL logging is crucial as it provides visibility into the traffic
  patterns and potential threats targeting your web applications. This logging capability
  allows organizations to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly, thereby
  minimizing the risk of security breaches. Moreover, maintaining comprehensive logs
  aids in regulatory compliance and audit readiness, which are essential for preserving
  business integrity.
description: This security rule verifies that WebACL logging is activated for resources
  within IBM Internet Services. Enabling this feature ensures that all web access
  control list (WebACL) activities are recorded, facilitating robust monitoring and
  analysis of web traffic. By doing so, organizations can enhance their security posture
  by identifying and mitigating threats in real-time. Additionally, having detailed
  logs supports compliance with industry standards and helps meet audit requirements
  by providing a thorough record of access control activities.
