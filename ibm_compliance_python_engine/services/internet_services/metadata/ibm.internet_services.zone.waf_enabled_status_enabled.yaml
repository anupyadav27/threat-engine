title: Enforce WAF Enabled Status for Enhanced Zone Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Web Application Firewall (WAF) is crucial for protecting web
  applications from common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and
  other OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities. By ensuring WAF is enabled, businesses can
  mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, thus safeguarding sensitive
  customer information and maintaining trust.
description: This rule verifies that the Web Application Firewall (WAF) is enabled
  for IBM Cloud Internet Services zones. WAF acts as a shield between the web application
  and the internet, analyzing traffic for malicious activity and blocking potential
  threats before they reach the application. Enforcing WAF protection enhances the
  security posture by preventing exploitation of known vulnerabilities, maintaining
  compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS, and reducing the potential for
  costly security incidents.
