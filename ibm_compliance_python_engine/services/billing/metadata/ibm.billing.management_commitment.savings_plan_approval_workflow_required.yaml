title: Mandatory Approval Workflow for Savings Plan Commitments
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing an approval workflow for savings plan commitments ensures
  that financial decisions are subject to oversight, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  or imprudent spending. This control is essential for maintaining budget integrity
  and aligning spending with organizational goals, thus minimizing financial risk
  and enhancing accountability.
description: This rule mandates that any commitment to a savings plan within IBM Cloud's
  billing services undergoes an approval workflow. The check verifies that workflows
  are configured to require approval from designated stakeholders before a savings
  plan is finalized. Enforcing an approval process enhances security by ensuring that
  spending decisions are vetted and comply with internal governance policies. It also
  aids in compliance with financial governance standards by documenting decision processes
  and accountability, providing a clear audit trail.
