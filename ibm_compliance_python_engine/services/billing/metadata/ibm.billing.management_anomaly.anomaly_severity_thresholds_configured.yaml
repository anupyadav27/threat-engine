title: Ensure Anomaly Severity Thresholds Are Configured for Billing Management
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring anomaly severity thresholds in billing management is crucial
  to promptly identify and address potential billing discrepancies or fraudulent activities.
  By establishing these thresholds, organizations can mitigate financial risks and
  maintain accurate billing operations, thus ensuring financial integrity and compliance
  with organizational policies.
description: This rule checks whether anomaly severity thresholds are configured for
  billing management within IBM Cloud. Properly setting these thresholds allows for
  automated monitoring and alerts when billing activities deviate beyond acceptable
  limits. This proactive measure enhances security by facilitating early detection
  of anomalies, helping organizations respond swiftly to potential threats or errors.
  Moreover, it supports compliance with governance frameworks by ensuring that billing
  practices are consistently monitored and controlled.
