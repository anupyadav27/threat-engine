rule_id: ibm.billing.management_category.access_billing_console_rbac_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Billing Console Access via RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that access to the Billing Console follows the principle of least
  privilege is crucial to minimizing potential security risks. Unauthorized or overly
  permissive access can lead to financial data exposure, unauthorized changes in billing
  settings, and potential financial loss, impacting business operations and compliance
  with financial regulations.
description: This rule mandates that access to the IBM Cloud Billing Console is restricted
  to only those users who require it for their job functions, using Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC). It verifies that permissions are granted on a need-to-know basis,
  helping to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of billing information.
  Implementing this rule enhances security by reducing the attack surface and supports
  compliance with industry standards by ensuring that only authorized personnel can
  view or modify sensitive billing data.
