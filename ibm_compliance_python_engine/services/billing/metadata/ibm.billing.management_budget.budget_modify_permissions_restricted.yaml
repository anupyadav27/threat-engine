title: Restrict Permissions for Modifying Billing Management Budgets
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that permissions to modify billing management budgets are restricted
  is crucial to prevent unauthorized changes that could lead to financial discrepancies
  or misuse of resources. By limiting who can alter budget settings, organizations
  can maintain accurate financial forecasting and avoid unexpected expenses, contributing
  to overall cost management and control.
description: This rule checks that only authorized users have the permissions to modify
  billing management budgets within IBM Cloud. By enforcing strict access controls,
  the organization can mitigate risks of unauthorized budget adjustments that may
  lead to financial mismanagement. This practice not only enhances security posture
  but also aids in achieving compliance with financial governance standards by ensuring
  that all budget modifications are traceable and authorized.
