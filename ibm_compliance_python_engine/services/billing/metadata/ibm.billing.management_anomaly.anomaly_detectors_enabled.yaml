title: Ensure Anomaly Detectors are Enabled for Billing Management
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling anomaly detectors for billing management is crucial for identifying
  and mitigating unusual billing activities that could indicate unauthorized usage
  or configuration errors. This proactive approach helps prevent unexpected expenses
  and enhances financial oversight, ensuring that billing aligns with organizational
  budgets and compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks whether anomaly detectors are activated for the billing
  management service within IBM Cloud. By enabling these detectors, organizations
  can monitor for irregular billing patterns that may signify potential security breaches
  or misconfigurations. Implementing anomaly detection contributes to a robust security
  posture by providing early warnings of potential issues, which is a key component
  of compliance and governance frameworks. It enhances security monitoring by ensuring
  that any significant deviations in billing practices are promptly identified and
  addressed.
