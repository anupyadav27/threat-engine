title: Ensure Budget Alert Destinations are Configured for Cost Management
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Proper configuration of budget alert destinations ensures that key stakeholders
  are promptly notified of any budget overruns or anomalies. This helps in maintaining
  financial accountability and preventing unexpected expenditure, thereby protecting
  the organization's financial health. It also aids in proactive cost management and
  aligns with best practices for cloud financial operations.
description: This rule checks whether budget alert destinations are configured for
  management budgets within IBM Cloud. By setting up alert destinations, organizations
  can ensure that notifications are sent to the appropriate personnel when spending
  thresholds are exceeded. This not only facilitates timely interventions but also
  strengthens the organization's cost governance framework. Moreover, it aids in compliance
  with financial oversight requirements by ensuring transparency and accountability
  in cloud spending.
