title: Ensure Alerts for Untagged Resource Allocation in IBM Billing
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Activating alerts for untagged resources in IBM Billing is crucial for
  maintaining visibility and accountability over cloud resource usage. By monitoring
  untagged resources, organizations can prevent unauthorized or unplanned expenditure,
  ensuring budget adherence and resource optimization. This practice also aids in
  identifying potential security risks associated with orphaned or misconfigured resources.
description: This rule verifies that alerts are enabled for any untagged resources
  within the IBM Billing management allocation service. By ensuring that these alerts
  are active, organizations can quickly respond to instances where resources are deployed
  without proper tagging, which is essential for accurate billing and resource management.
  Enabling such alerts enhances security posture by preventing potential oversights
  in resource allocation and ensures compliance with financial and operational governance
  policies. It also facilitates audit processes by providing clear visibility into
  resource utilization and accountability.
