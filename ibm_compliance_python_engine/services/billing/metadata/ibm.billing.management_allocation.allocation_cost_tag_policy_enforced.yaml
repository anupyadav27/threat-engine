title: Enforce Allocation Cost Tag Policy for Cost Management
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing an allocation cost tag policy is crucial for maintaining effective
  cost management and accountability within an organization. By ensuring that all
  billing allocations are tagged appropriately, organizations can easily track and
  manage their cloud expenditures, prevent unauthorized spending, and allocate resources
  more efficiently. This policy is especially important for compliance and audit purposes,
  as it provides clear visibility into cost allocation across different departments
  and projects.
description: This rule verifies that an enforced allocation cost tag policy is applied
  to all billing management allocations within the IBM Cloud environment. It checks
  for the presence of mandatory tags that categorize and identify expenses according
  to organizational policies. By enforcing this policy, organizations gain enhanced
  visibility into cloud spending patterns, allowing for improved budgeting and financial
  forecasting. Moreover, it aids in compliance with internal governance and external
  regulatory requirements by providing a structured approach to cost tracking and
  resource allocation.
