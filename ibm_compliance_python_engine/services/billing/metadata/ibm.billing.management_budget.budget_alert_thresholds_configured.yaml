title: Ensure Budget Alert Thresholds are Configured in IBM Cloud Billing
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring budget alert thresholds is crucial for maintaining financial
  control and visibility over cloud expenditures. It helps prevent unexpected cost
  overruns by notifying stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds predefined
  limits, thereby safeguarding against potential budgetary constraints and financial
  mismanagement.
description: This security rule verifies that budget alert thresholds are set for
  management budgets within the IBM Cloud billing service. By ensuring these thresholds
  are configured, organizations can proactively monitor and manage cloud spending,
  which enhances financial governance and accountability. Additionally, setting budget
  alert thresholds supports compliance with internal financial policies and can aid
  in adherence to external regulatory requirements related to cost management and
  transparency.
