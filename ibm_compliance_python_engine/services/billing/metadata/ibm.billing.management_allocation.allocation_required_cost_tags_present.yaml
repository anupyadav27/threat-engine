title: Ensure Allocation Required Cost Tags Are Present for Billing Management
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing cost tags in billing management allocation is crucial for
  maintaining transparency and accountability in financial operations. These tags
  enable organizations to track expenses accurately, ensure budget adherence, and
  prevent unauthorized expenditures. Furthermore, it helps in aligning cloud expenditures
  with business objectives, thereby optimizing resource allocation and financial planning.
description: This rule verifies that all management allocation resources within the
  IBM Cloud billing service have the necessary cost tags applied. Cost tags are metadata
  elements that categorize expenses, which aid in detailed cost analysis and reporting.
  By ensuring these tags are present, the rule enhances security by facilitating the
  detection of anomalous spending patterns and unauthorized resource usage. Additionally,
  it supports compliance with corporate governance policies and regulatory requirements
  by providing comprehensive audit trails for financial transactions.
