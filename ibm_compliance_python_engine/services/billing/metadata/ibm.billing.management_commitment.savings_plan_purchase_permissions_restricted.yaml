title: Restrict Savings Plan Purchase Permissions for Enhanced Governance
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Limiting permissions to purchase savings plans is critical to maintaining
  financial control and preventing unauthorized expenditures. By ensuring that only
  authorized personnel can commit to savings plans, organizations can mitigate unnecessary
  financial risks and align spending with budgetary constraints, thus enhancing overall
  fiscal responsibility.
description: This rule ensures that permissions to purchase savings plans within the
  IBM Cloud billing management are restricted to designated individuals or groups.
  By enforcing this control, organizations can prevent unauthorized or fraudulent
  savings plan purchases, which could lead to unexpected financial commitments. This
  restriction is a key aspect of compliance and governance, as it aligns with best
  practices for financial oversight and internal controls within cloud environments.
  Additionally, it aids in maintaining clear audit trails and accountability, which
  are crucial for regulatory compliance and security monitoring.
