title: Enforce Least Privilege for Cost Export Destinations in Billing
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for access to cost export destinations is
  crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized data exposure or manipulation. By restricting
  permissions to only those necessary for users to perform their tasks, organizations
  protect sensitive financial data, maintain compliance with regulatory requirements,
  and reduce potential attack vectors within the billing management category.
description: This rule ensures that access permissions for cost export destinations
  in IBM Cloud Billing are configured following the principle of least privilege.
  It checks that only users who require access to export financial data are granted
  the necessary permissions, thereby reducing the potential for data breaches and
  insider threats. Enforcing least privilege enhances security posture by limiting
  access to sensitive data and helps organizations adhere to compliance standards
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS, which mandate strict controls over financial information.
