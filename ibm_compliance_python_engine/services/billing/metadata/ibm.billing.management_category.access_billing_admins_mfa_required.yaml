rule_id: ibm.billing.management_category.access_billing_admins_mfa_required
title: Enforce MFA for Billing Admins to Protect Financial Data
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Billing Admins is crucial
  to safeguard financial data and prevent unauthorized access. This measure significantly
  reduces the risk of credential theft, thereby protecting the organization from potential
  financial fraud and ensuring the integrity of billing operations.
description: This rule mandates the use of Multi-Factor Authentication for users with
  administrative access to billing management categories within IBM Cloud. By enforcing
  MFA, the rule enhances security by requiring an additional verification step beyond
  just a password, thereby strengthening the authentication process. This practice
  aligns with industry standards for protecting sensitive financial information and
  demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements for data security. Ensuring
  MFA is in place for billing admins helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and aligns with best practices for identity and access management.
