rule_id: ibm.billing.management_category.access_cost_data_exports_private_and_encrypted
title: Ensure Billing Cost Data Exports are Private and Encrypted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Protecting sensitive billing information is crucial to maintaining privacy
  and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Encryption of
  cost data exports ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable
  and secure, protecting both the organization’s financial details and customer data.
  This practice also aligns with compliance standards, reducing potential legal and
  financial repercussions for non-compliance.
description: This rule checks that all exported billing cost data from the management
  category is encrypted at rest, ensuring that sensitive financial data is not exposed
  to unauthorized users. By enforcing encryption, the organization ensures that data
  is protected from unauthorized access and potential breaches, even if the storage
  medium is compromised. This measure is a key component of a robust data protection
  strategy, enhancing the security posture of the organization and supporting compliance
  with industry standards and regulations like GDPR and ISO 27001.
