title: Enforce MFA for Savings Plan Billing Admins to Secure Billing Access
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Savings Plan Billing Admins
  is crucial in preventing unauthorized access to billing management features. This
  extra layer of security helps protect sensitive financial information and reduces
  the risk of fraudulent activities that could lead to financial losses and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule verifies that Savings Plan Billing Administrators in IBM Cloud
  have MFA enabled for their accounts. By enforcing MFA, the rule ensures that access
  to critical billing management resources is secured with an additional authentication
  factor beyond just passwords. This measure significantly enhances the security posture
  by mitigating the risks associated with compromised credentials. Implementing MFA
  also aligns with industry best practices and compliance regulations, thereby fortifying
  the organization's overall security and compliance framework.
