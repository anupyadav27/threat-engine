title: Ensuring Reserved Concurrency for IBM Code Engine Functions
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Reserved concurrency in IBM Code Engine functions is crucial for preventing
  resource exhaustion and ensuring predictable application performance. By reserving
  a specific amount of concurrency, you can safeguard against noisy neighbor issues
  and ensure that critical functions maintain their performance levels, thus minimizing
  the risk of service disruptions and potential financial losses.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Code Engine functions have a reserved concurrency
  setting configured. Reserved concurrency ensures that functions have dedicated execution
  capacity, mitigating risk from shared resource contention. Implementing reserved
  concurrency enhances security by preventing denial-of-service scenarios caused by
  overloading shared resources, thereby ensuring compliance with best practices for
  resource management. This approach aligns with governance policies that mandate
  resource allocation controls for cloud environments.
