rule_id: ibm.code_engine.application.engine_task_definition_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Code Engine Task Definitions
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for IBM Code Engine task definitions is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into application behavior and identifying potential security incidents.
  Proper logging aids in debugging, compliance adherence, and forensic investigations,
  thereby minimizing the risks associated with undetected anomalies and unauthorized
  access.
description: This rule verifies that logging is configured and enabled for all task
  definitions within IBM Code Engine applications. By ensuring that logs are actively
  captured, organizations can monitor application activities, detect unusual patterns
  indicative of security threats, and maintain an audit trail necessary for compliance
  with industry standards and regulations. This practice not only enhances security
  posture by enabling timely responses to incidents but also supports regulatory requirements
  for data protection and operational transparency.
