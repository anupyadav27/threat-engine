rule_id: ibm.code_engine.resource.statemachine_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Logging is Enabled for IBM Code Engine State Machines
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for IBM Code Engine state machines is critical for maintaining
  visibility into application behavior and performance. It provides a means to audit
  actions and detect anomalies, ensuring that any unauthorized or unexpected activities
  are promptly identified and addressed. By maintaining comprehensive logs, businesses
  can better safeguard sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for state machines within
  the IBM Code Engine service. When state machine logging is activated, detailed records
  of state transitions, execution results, and errors are stored, facilitating effective
  monitoring and troubleshooting. This practice enhances security by providing a trail
  of activity that can be analyzed to uncover malicious activities or system misuse.
  Additionally, it supports compliance with standards that mandate logging and audit
  capabilities, thereby bolstering the organization's overall security posture.
