title: Ensure Engine Managed Updates are Enabled for Code Engine Applications
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling engine-managed updates for applications in IBM Code Engine ensures
  that the latest security patches and performance enhancements are automatically
  applied, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helps maintain
  the integrity and availability of applications, thereby mitigating potential business
  disruptions and protecting sensitive data.
description: This rule verifies that engine-managed updates are enabled for applications
  deployed on IBM Code Engine. By enabling this feature, organizations ensure that
  their applications automatically receive updates for critical security patches and
  feature improvements without manual intervention. This enhances the overall security
  posture by keeping applications up-to-date with the latest security standards and
  compliance requirements, thus reducing the risk of exploitation from known vulnerabilities.
