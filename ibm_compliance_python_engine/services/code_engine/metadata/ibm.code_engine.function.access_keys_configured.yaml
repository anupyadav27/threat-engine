title: Ensure Access Keys are Configured for IBM Code Engine Functions
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Configuring access keys for IBM Code Engine functions is crucial to ensure
  only authorized entities can invoke or interact with these functions. Without access
  keys, functions could be susceptible to unauthorized access, leading to potential
  data breaches or compromise of sensitive operations. Properly managing access keys
  helps maintain robust access control, thereby protecting organizational assets and
  maintaining customer trust.
description: This security rule checks whether access keys are configured for IBM
  Code Engine functions, which is vital for securing the invocation and management
  of these serverless resources. By ensuring that access keys are set up, organizations
  can enforce stringent authentication mechanisms, preventing unauthorized access
  and ensuring that only validated users or services can execute functions. This practice
  not only enhances the security posture by reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  but also aids in compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate
  strict access control measures.
