rule_id: ibm.code_engine.application.http_logs_enabled
title: Ensure HTTP Logging is Enabled for IBM Code Engine Applications
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling HTTP logging for IBM Code Engine applications is crucial for maintaining
  robust security and compliance. It allows for detailed tracking of HTTP requests
  and responses, which aids in identifying potential security threats and operational
  issues. This practice enhances auditing capabilities, ensuring transparency and
  accountability, which is vital for meeting regulatory requirements and improving
  overall system integrity.
description: This rule checks whether HTTP logging is enabled for applications running
  on IBM Code Engine. By ensuring HTTP logs are active, organizations can capture
  comprehensive details about each HTTP transaction, including request headers, response
  status, and payloads. This data is invaluable for security teams to perform thorough
  audits, detect anomalies, and conduct forensic investigations if needed. Additionally,
  maintaining detailed logs supports compliance with industry standards and regulations,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, by providing a verifiable trail of user interactions and
  operational activities.
