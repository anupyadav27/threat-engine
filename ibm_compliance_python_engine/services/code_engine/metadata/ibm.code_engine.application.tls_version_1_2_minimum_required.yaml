rule_id: ibm.code_engine.application.tls_version_1_2_minimum_required
title: Enforce Minimum TLS 1.2 for Secure IBM Code Engine Applications
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for IBM Code Engine applications
  ensures robust encryption standards, protecting data in transit from interception
  and unauthorized access. This helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality,
  aligning with industry best practices and regulatory requirements, thereby minimizing
  risks associated with outdated and vulnerable encryption protocols.
description: This security rule mandates that all IBM Code Engine applications utilize
  TLS 1.2 or higher for secure communication. The rule checks application configurations
  to verify compliance, ensuring encryption protocols meet or exceed current security
  standards. By enforcing this rule, organizations enhance their data protection strategies,
  reducing vulnerabilities to man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring compliance with
  regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS, which require strong encryption methodologies.
