title: Enforce Admin Privileges for Code Engine Function Identities
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that only identities with administrative privileges can manage
  Code Engine functions is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of cloud-native
  applications. Unauthorized access or privilege escalation can lead to data breaches,
  disruption of services, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements, which can
  have significant legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that all identities associated with IBM Code Engine
  functions possess the necessary administrative privileges, following the principle
  of least privilege. By restricting function management to authorized identities,
  this rule mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential malicious activities.
  Implementing this policy enhances security posture, supports compliance with industry
  standards, and reduces the attack surface by ensuring that only trusted users can
  perform sensitive actions within the Code Engine environment.
