title: Ensure Code Engine Functions Utilize VPC Multi-AZ Deployment
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing functions across multiple availability zones (AZs) within
  a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enhances fault tolerance and minimizes the risk of
  service disruptions. By leveraging multiple AZs, applications can maintain high
  availability and resilience against localized failures, which is critical for business
  continuity and operational reliability.
description: This security rule verifies that IBM Code Engine functions are deployed
  within a VPC that spans multiple availability zones. By ensuring functions are distributed
  across multiple AZs, the rule enhances network security and connectivity by reducing
  the impact of potential outages in a single zone. This setup not only bolsters the
  security posture by mitigating single points of failure but also aligns with best
  practices for achieving compliance with industry standards related to high availability
  and disaster recovery.
