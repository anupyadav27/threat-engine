rule_id: ibm.code_engine.resource.environment_monitoring_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Environment Monitoring Logging is Enabled for Code Engine
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling environment monitoring logging in IBM Code Engine is crucial for
  maintaining visibility into application activities and detecting potential security
  incidents. It allows organizations to audit actions taken within their cloud environments,
  ensuring that any unauthorized or suspicious activity can be quickly identified
  and addressed, thus reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with
  industry regulations.
description: This security rule checks that logging is enabled for environment monitoring
  within IBM Code Engine resources. By ensuring that logging is active, organizations
  can capture detailed records of operations and interactions within their cloud environments.
  This practice enhances security by providing a trail of actions that can be analyzed
  for unusual patterns or unauthorized access. Additionally, maintaining comprehensive
  audit logs supports compliance with regulatory standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA,
  which require thorough documentation of access and activity within digital systems.
