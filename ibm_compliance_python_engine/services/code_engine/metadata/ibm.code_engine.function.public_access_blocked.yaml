rule_id: ibm.code_engine.function.public_access_blocked
title: Enforce Code Engine Function Public Access Restrictions
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to IBM Cloud Code Engine functions is crucial to
  safeguard sensitive business logic and data from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible
  functions can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to potential data breaches,
  unauthorized data manipulation, and service disruptions, which can severely impact
  business operations and reputation.
description: This rule ensures that all IBM Cloud Code Engine functions are configured
  to block public access, thereby restricting unauthorized access and mitigating potential
  security risks. It checks for any function within the Code Engine service that is
  publicly accessible and mandates the implementation of access controls to confine
  access to authenticated and authorized users only. Enforcing this rule enhances
  the overall security posture by ensuring compliance with best practices in identity
  and access management, reducing the attack surface, and ensuring that functions
  are invoked only by trusted entities.
