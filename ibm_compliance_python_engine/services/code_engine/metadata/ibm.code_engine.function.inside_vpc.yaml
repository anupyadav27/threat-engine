rule_id: ibm.code_engine.function.inside_vpc
title: Ensure Code Engine Functions Reside Within a VPC for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Placing IBM Code Engine functions within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  enhances security by isolating these resources from public access, reducing the
  exposure to potential security threats. This configuration ensures that sensitive
  workloads are protected by network controls and policies, which can prevent unauthorized
  access and data breaches, ultimately safeguarding business operations and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that Code Engine functions are deployed within a VPC,
  ensuring they benefit from the inherent security and access control features of
  a private network environment. By operating inside a VPC, functions are shielded
  from direct exposure to the internet, allowing for more stringent network security
  measures such as security groups and access control lists (ACLs) to be applied.
  This setup aligns with best practices for network security and compliance, helping
  organizations meet regulatory requirements and maintain a robust security posture.
