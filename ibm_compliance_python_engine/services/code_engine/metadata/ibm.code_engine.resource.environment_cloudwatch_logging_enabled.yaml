title: Ensure Cloudwatch Logging is Enabled for IBM Code Engine Environments
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling Cloudwatch logging for IBM Code Engine environments is crucial
  for maintaining a robust security posture. It allows for the continuous monitoring
  and recording of application logs, essential for diagnosing issues, detecting unauthorized
  access, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. Failure to enable
  logging can lead to undetected security breaches and operational inefficiencies,
  negatively impacting business continuity and compliance adherence.
description: This rule verifies that Cloudwatch logging is enabled for IBM Code Engine
  resources, ensuring that all activities within the environment are recorded and
  accessible for audit and analysis. By enabling logging, organizations can enhance
  their ability to monitor real-time activities, detect anomalies, and respond promptly
  to security incidents. This practice also supports compliance efforts by providing
  a comprehensive audit trail, thereby meeting various regulatory and industry standards.
  Enabling logging not only strengthens security but also aids in operational troubleshooting
  and performance tuning by providing detailed insights into application behavior.
