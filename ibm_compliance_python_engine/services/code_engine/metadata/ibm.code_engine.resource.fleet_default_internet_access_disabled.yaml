title: Ensure Fleet Default Internet Access is Disabled in IBM Code Engine
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling default internet access for IBM Code Engine fleets is crucial
  to minimizing unauthorized data exposure and reducing the attack surface. By restricting
  internet access, organizations can better control the flow of sensitive information,
  thereby enhancing the security posture and aligning with best practices in identity
  and access management.
description: This rule checks whether the default internet access is disabled for
  fleets within IBM Code Engine, ensuring that only explicitly allowed connections
  are made. By enforcing this restriction, you mitigate the risk of unauthorized data
  exfiltration and external threats. This practice not only strengthens your security
  measures but also aids in compliance with regulatory standards that require controlled
  network access and robust authentication mechanisms.
