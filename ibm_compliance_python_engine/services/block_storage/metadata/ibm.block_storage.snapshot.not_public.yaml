rule_id: ibm.block_storage.snapshot.not_public
title: Ensure Block Storage Snapshots Are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Publicly accessible block storage snapshots can expose sensitive data to
  unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.
  Ensuring that snapshots are not public is critical to maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity, thereby protecting business interests and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that block storage snapshots in IBM Cloud are not
  configured for public access. By enforcing this restriction, it mitigates the risk
  of exposing sensitive data and ensures that only authorized users can access storage
  snapshots. This practice aligns with best security practices and helps organizations
  adhere to privacy regulations and compliance standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  by safeguarding stored data and reducing the attack surface.
