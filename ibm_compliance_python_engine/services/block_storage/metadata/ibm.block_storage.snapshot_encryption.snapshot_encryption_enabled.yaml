rule_id: ibm.block_storage.snapshot_encryption.snapshot_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Snapshot Encryption is Enabled for Block Storage
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling snapshot encryption for block storage is crucial in safeguarding
  data at rest against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Unencrypted
  snapshots pose a significant risk as they can be exploited by attackers to gain
  access to sensitive data, leading to reputational damage and potential regulatory
  fines.
description: This rule checks whether encryption is enabled for snapshots within IBM
  Cloud block storage. Ensuring snapshots are encrypted enhances data protection by
  safeguarding the stored data from unauthorized access and potential exposure. This
  practice aligns with industry standards for data protection and helps organizations
  meet compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that sensitive
  data is encrypted at rest, thus mitigating the risk of data breaches.
