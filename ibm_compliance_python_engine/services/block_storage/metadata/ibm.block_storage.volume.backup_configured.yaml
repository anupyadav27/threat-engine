title: Ensure Backup Configurations for IBM Cloud Block Storage Volumes
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Configuring backups for block storage volumes is crucial to protect against
  data loss due to accidental deletion, corruption, or disaster events. Without a
  reliable backup strategy, businesses risk losing critical data, leading to operational
  disruptions, financial loss, and damage to reputation. Ensuring backups are configured
  helps maintain data integrity and availability, aligning with best practices for
  business continuity.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud Block Storage volumes have backup configurations
  in place. It checks for automated or scheduled backups, ensuring that data is regularly
  copied to a secure location. By implementing this rule, organizations can safeguard
  their data against potential loss and ensure that recovery options are readily available.
  This practice not only enhances data security but also supports compliance with
  industry standards and regulations that mandate data protection and disaster recovery
  plans.
