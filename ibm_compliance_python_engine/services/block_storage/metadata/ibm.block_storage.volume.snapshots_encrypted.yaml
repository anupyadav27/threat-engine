title: Ensure Encryption of Snapshots for IBM Block Storage Volumes
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encryption of snapshots is critical to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
  access and potential breaches. By encrypting snapshots, businesses can ensure that
  their stored data complies with industry standards and regulations, thereby avoiding
  potential legal ramifications and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all snapshots of IBM Cloud Block Storage volumes
  are encrypted at rest. Encryption enhances data security by converting data into
  a secure format that is only accessible to those with the decryption key. This practice
  not only safeguards sensitive information from unauthorized access but also supports
  compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. By ensuring all
  snapshots are encrypted, organizations can reduce the risk of data exposure and
  strengthen their overall security posture.
