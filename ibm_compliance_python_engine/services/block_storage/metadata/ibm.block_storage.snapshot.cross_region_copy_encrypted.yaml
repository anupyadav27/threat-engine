rule_id: ibm.block_storage.snapshot.cross_region_copy_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for Cross-Region Block Storage Snapshot Transfers
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that block storage snapshots are encrypted during cross-region
  transfers is critical to maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. Unencrypted
  data in transit can be intercepted, leading to unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. This rule helps organizations meet regulatory requirements, protect
  sensitive data, and maintain customer trust.
description: This rule checks that all block storage snapshots being copied across
  regions are encrypted. By enforcing encryption at rest and during transit, it ensures
  that data remains secure against unauthorized access. Implementing this rule not
  only enhances overall data protection strategies but also aids in compliance with
  industry standards and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. This proactive measure
  helps mitigate risks associated with data exposure during cross-region transfers.
