title: Ensure CMK-Based Encryption Configured for Block Storage Volumes
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Configuring Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) for block storage volumes is crucial
  for maintaining control over data encryption. This practice enhances data protection
  by allowing organizations to manage their encryption keys, thereby reducing the
  risk of unauthorized data access and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies whether block storage volumes in IBM Cloud are configured
  with Customer-Managed Key (CMK) encryption. By enabling CMK, organizations can manage
  and rotate their encryption keys, providing an additional layer of security beyond
  the default encryption. This configuration not only ensures data confidentiality
  and integrity but also assists in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which require robust data protection measures. The rule checks for the presence
  of a CMK in the encryption configuration of block storage volumes, thus enhancing
  the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
