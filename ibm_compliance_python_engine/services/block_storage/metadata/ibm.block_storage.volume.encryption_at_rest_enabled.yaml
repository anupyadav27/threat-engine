title: Ensure Encryption at Rest is Enabled for IBM Block Storage Volumes
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting data at rest is a critical security measure that protects sensitive
  information stored in block storage from unauthorized access and data breaches.
  By ensuring encryption at rest is enabled, organizations mitigate the risk of data
  exposure and meet compliance requirements, thereby safeguarding business integrity
  and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all IBM Cloud Block Storage volumes have encryption
  at rest enabled, ensuring data is safeguarded when stored. Encryption at rest protects
  data by using cryptographic algorithms to encode it, making it inaccessible without
  authorized decryption keys. This practice enhances security by preventing data from
  being readable even if physical storage resources are compromised. It also aids
  in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulatory frameworks that mandate
  data protection measures, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
