rule_id: ibm.block_storage.snapshot.encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of IBM Cloud Block Storage Snapshots at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting block storage snapshots at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and ensuring data privacy. Failure to encrypt these
  snapshots can lead to data breaches, exposing confidential information and resulting
  in potential financial and reputational damage for businesses. Adhering to this
  encryption requirement helps maintain compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  mandates.
description: This rule checks that all IBM Cloud block storage snapshots are encrypted
  at rest, ensuring that stored data remains protected from unauthorized access. Encryption
  provides an additional layer of security by converting data into a secure format
  that requires a decryption key for access, thereby safeguarding sensitive information
  from potential compromise. Implementing encryption at rest aligns with data protection
  best practices and helps organizations meet compliance requirements for data privacy
  and security frameworks.
