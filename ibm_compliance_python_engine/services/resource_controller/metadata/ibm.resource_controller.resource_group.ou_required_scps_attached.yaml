title: Ensure Security Controls are Attached to Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Attaching appropriate security controls to resource groups in IBM Cloud
  ensures that organizational policies are enforced consistently across all resources.
  This practice minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches
  by ensuring that all resources adhere to defined security guidelines. Moreover,
  it supports compliance with industry regulations by maintaining a structured security
  posture.
description: This rule verifies that all resource groups within the IBM Cloud have
  the necessary security control policies (SCPs) attached, as specified by the organization's
  security and governance requirements. By ensuring that SCPs are consistently applied,
  the rule enhances the overall security framework, ensuring that resources are safeguarded
  against misuse and unauthorized access. Additionally, it aids in maintaining compliance
  with regulatory standards, thereby reducing legal and financial risks associated
  with non-compliance.
