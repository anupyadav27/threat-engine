title: Ensure Required Config Rules Exist in IBM Cloud Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing the presence of essential configuration rules within IBM Cloud
  resource groups is vital for maintaining consistent security policies and governance
  across the cloud environment. This practice mitigates risks associated with misconfigurations
  and unauthorized access, thereby protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance
  with industry standards and regulations.
description: This rule verifies that required configuration rules are established
  and active within IBM Cloud resource groups. By ensuring the presence of these rules,
  organizations can automate security monitoring and enforce compliance with internal
  and external policies. This proactive approach enhances the security posture by
  reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities and ensuring that any deviations from
  established security baselines are promptly identified and addressed.
