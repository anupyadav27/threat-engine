title: Ensure Evidence Export is Enabled for IBM Cloud Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling evidence export for IBM Cloud resource groups is crucial for maintaining
  robust security monitoring and compliance. It allows organizations to gather detailed
  logging information, aiding in the detection and investigation of unauthorized access
  or anomalies. This proactive approach supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  by ensuring that comprehensive audit trails are available for review.
description: This rule verifies that evidence export is enabled for resource groups
  managed by the IBM Cloud Resource Controller. By ensuring evidence export is active,
  organizations can continuously monitor security events and maintain a detailed record
  of access and modifications within their resource groups. This capability enhances
  the organization's security posture by facilitating incident response and forensic
  analysis, while also supporting compliance with governance frameworks such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
