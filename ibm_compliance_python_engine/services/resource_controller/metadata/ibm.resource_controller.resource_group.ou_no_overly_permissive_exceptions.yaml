rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.ou_no_overly_permissive_exceptions
title: Prevent Overly Permissive Exceptions in Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that exceptions in resource group permissions are not overly permissive
  is crucial to maintaining a secure cloud environment. Overly permissive access can
  lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources, increasing the risk
  of data breaches and compliance violations. By adhering to the principle of least
  privilege, organizations can reduce their attack surface and align with security
  best practices.
description: This rule checks for overly permissive exceptions within IBM Cloud resource
  group permissions, ensuring that access controls adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. It identifies any deviations from strict access policies and flags them
  for review, helping to maintain robust security postures. Implementing this rule
  enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and also aids in meeting compliance
  requirements by enforcing strict access controls across cloud resources.
