title: Ensure Auto Tag Policies Are Enabled for Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling auto tag policies on resource groups in IBM Cloud enhances resource
  management by ensuring consistent tagging across your cloud environment. This practice
  facilitates efficient tracking, billing, and compliance reporting, reducing the
  risk of mismanagement and unauthorized access to resources.
description: This rule checks whether auto tag policies are enabled for resource groups
  in IBM Cloud where supported. By applying automatic tagging, organizations can uniformly
  enforce metadata standards, helping to manage resources effectively and maintain
  compliance with internal governance and external regulatory requirements. Consistent
  tagging aids in security monitoring by providing clear visibility into resource
  ownership and usage patterns, which is vital for audit trails and incident response
  strategies.
