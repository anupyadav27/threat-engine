rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.org_block_leave_org_by_policy
title: Enforce Policy to Prevent Unauthorized Organization Departures
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: This rule is critical as it prevents unauthorized users from leaving an
  organization, which could lead to potential security breaches and loss of access
  control. Unauthorized departure from an organization can disrupt service management,
  lead to data exposure, and compromise compliance with regulatory requirements. By
  enforcing this policy, organizations can maintain robust control over their resource
  allocations and user access, ensuring a secure and compliant cloud environment.
description: The rule checks for policies that prevent users from leaving an organization
  without proper authorization within the IBM Cloud resource groups. By implementing
  this control, organizations ensure that only authorized personnel can manage or
  alter their membership status, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining
  compliance with organizational access policies. This practice enhances security
  by enforcing strict access controls and aligns with best practices in identity and
  access management, reducing the risk of insider threats and unauthorized access.
