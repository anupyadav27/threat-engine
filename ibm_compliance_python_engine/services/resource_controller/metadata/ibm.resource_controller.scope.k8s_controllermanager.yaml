rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.scope.k8s_controllermanager
title: Ensure Kubernetes Controller Manager Logs Are Monitored and Analyzed
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Monitoring the Kubernetes Controller Manager is crucial for maintaining
  the security and integrity of cluster operations. The Controller Manager is responsible
  for managing core control loops, and any misconfigurations or anomalies can lead
  to security breaches or operational failures. By ensuring its logs are monitored,
  organizations can quickly detect and respond to potential threats, minimizing the
  risk of data loss and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether the logs from the Kubernetes Controller Manager
  are being actively monitored and analyzed for unusual activity or misconfigurations.
  The Controller Manager plays a critical role in maintaining the desired state of
  the cluster, and its logs can provide insights into potential security incidents
  or compliance issues. Implementing this rule enhances security by enabling early
  detection of threats and supports compliance with best practices and regulatory
  frameworks by ensuring that critical operations are consistently monitored.
