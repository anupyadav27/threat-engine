rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.aggregation_authorization_trusts_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege in Resource Group Aggregation Authorization
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that aggregation authorizations adhere to the principle of least
  privilege is critical in minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches. By restricting resource group permissions to the minimum necessary,
  organizations can prevent privilege escalation and reduce the attack surface, thereby
  protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks that resource group aggregation authorizations within
  IBM Cloud adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and services
  have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. By enforcing least privilege,
  the organization minimizes potential access to sensitive operations and resources,
  thereby enhancing security posture and reducing the risk of insider threats. Compliance
  with this rule supports adherence to regulatory frameworks and industry best practices,
  contributing to a robust identity and access management strategy.
