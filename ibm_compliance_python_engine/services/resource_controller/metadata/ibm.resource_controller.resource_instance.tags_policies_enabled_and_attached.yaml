rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_instance.tags_policies_enabled_and_attached
title: Enable and Attach Tags Policies for IBM Resource Instances
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling and attaching tags policies to IBM Cloud resource instances is
  crucial for maintaining an organized and secure cloud environment. Tags facilitate
  resource management, cost allocation, and compliance tracking by ensuring that all
  cloud resources are appropriately categorized. Without these policies, organizations
  may face difficulties in auditing and tracking resources, leading to potential security
  vulnerabilities and compliance violations.
description: This rule ensures that all resource instances within the IBM Cloud have
  tags policies enabled and properly attached. By enforcing the use of tags, organizations
  can systematically categorize and manage their cloud resources, thereby enhancing
  visibility and control. Tags are essential for implementing fine-grained access
  controls, tracking resource usage, and ensuring compliance with organizational and
  regulatory standards. This practice reduces the risk of unauthorized access and
  simplifies resource audits, contributing to a more secure and efficient cloud infrastructure.
