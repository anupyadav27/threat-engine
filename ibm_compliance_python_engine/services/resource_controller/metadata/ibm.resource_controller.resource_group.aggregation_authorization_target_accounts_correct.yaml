rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.aggregation_authorization_target_accounts_correct
title: Ensure Correct Aggregation Authorization for Target Accounts
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Proper aggregation authorization for target accounts within IBM Cloud is
  crucial to maintain secure data access and prevent unauthorized resource manipulation.
  Misconfigured permissions can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access, compromising
  the integrity of cloud operations and potentially resulting in compliance violations.
description: This rule verifies that aggregation authorizations for resource group
  target accounts are correctly configured within the IBM Cloud environment. It checks
  the permissions granted to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege,
  thereby reducing the risk of excessive access. By enforcing proper authorization
  settings, this rule helps organizations maintain robust security postures and ensures
  compliance with industry standards by preventing unauthorized data aggregation and
  access.
