title: Ensuring Remediation Targets for Resource Group Configurations
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Binding remediation targets to resource group configurations is crucial
  for maintaining a proactive security posture within the IBM Cloud. It ensures that
  any non-compliant configurations within a resource group can be quickly identified
  and corrected, minimizing potential risks to data integrity and system availability.
  This practice supports organizational compliance and governance requirements, reducing
  the likelihood of security incidents and audit failures.
description: This security rule checks if resource groups within the IBM Cloud have
  defined remediation targets for configuration issues. By establishing clear paths
  for remediation, organizations can automate corrective actions, ensuring that any
  deviations from security policies are promptly addressed. This capability not only
  enhances the overall security posture of the cloud environment but also facilitates
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements by maintaining consistent
  and auditable security practices within resource groups.
