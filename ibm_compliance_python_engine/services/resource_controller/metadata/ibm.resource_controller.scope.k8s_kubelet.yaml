rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.scope.k8s_kubelet
title: Ensure Secure Configuration of K8s Kubelet on IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Proper configuration of the Kubernetes Kubelet is critical to maintaining
  the security and integrity of containerized applications hosted on the IBM Cloud.
  Misconfigured Kubelets can expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access,
  leading to potential data breaches and operational disruptions. Ensuring secure
  Kubelet settings helps protect business continuity and upholds customer trust by
  safeguarding their data.
description: This security rule checks the configuration of the Kubernetes Kubelet
  to ensure it adheres to industry best practices and IBM Cloud security guidelines.
  By validating the Kubelet settings, the rule helps mitigate risks such as unauthorized
  access and privilege escalation. The rule contributes to a robust security posture
  by enforcing configurations that prevent potential vulnerabilities and align with
  regulatory compliance requirements. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on
  this rule can significantly enhance the overall security framework of Kubernetes
  deployments on the IBM Cloud.
