rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.project_no_public_admin_roles
title: Restrict Public Admin Roles in IBM Cloud Resource Groups
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Assigning public admin roles to resource groups poses significant security
  risks as it can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  that administrative privileges are not publicly available, organizations can safeguard
  sensitive resources and maintain the integrity of their cloud environment, thereby
  mitigating the risk of accidental or malicious misuse.
description: This rule examines IBM Cloud resource groups to ensure no administrative
  roles are publicly accessible. By enforcing this rule, organizations can prevent
  unauthorized users from gaining elevated privileges that could lead to unauthorized
  changes or data exfiltration. Adhering to this rule enhances security posture and
  aligns with compliance standards such as CIS and NIST, which advocate for least
  privilege principles and controlled access to critical resources.
