title: Ensure Dashboards are Enabled for Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling dashboards for resource groups in IBM Cloud is crucial for maintaining
  visibility into your cloud environment's security posture. Dashboards provide centralized
  monitoring and reporting capabilities, which help in identifying and responding
  to security incidents promptly. This proactive approach minimizes the risk of data
  breaches and ensures compliance with industry standards, ultimately safeguarding
  business operations.
description: This rule verifies that dashboards are enabled for resource groups within
  the IBM Cloud Resource Controller. By enabling dashboards, users can monitor resource
  usage, performance, and security metrics in a consolidated view, enhancing situational
  awareness. This setup facilitates early detection of anomalies and unauthorized
  activities, contributing to a robust security monitoring framework. Additionally,
  it supports compliance efforts by maintaining an audit trail of resource activities,
  essential for regulatory audits.
