title: Ensure Policy Versioning and Change Audit is Enabled for Resource Groups
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling policy versioning and change audit for resource groups is crucial
  for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. This practice ensures
  that all changes to resource group policies are tracked, enabling organizations
  to detect unauthorized access attempts and policy misconfigurations. It also supports
  compliance with industry regulations and internal governance requirements, protecting
  business assets and sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that policy versioning and change audit logging are
  enabled for IBM Cloud resource groups. By doing so, it ensures that any modifications
  to resource group policies are recorded and versioned, providing a comprehensive
  audit trail. This functionality enhances security by enabling administrators to
  track changes, identify potential security incidents, and quickly revert to previous
  policy configurations if necessary. Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance
  frameworks that mandate rigorous change management and auditing processes.
