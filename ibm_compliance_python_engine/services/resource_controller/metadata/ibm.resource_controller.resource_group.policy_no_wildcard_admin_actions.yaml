rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.policy_no_wildcard_admin_actions
title: Prohibit Wildcard Admin Actions in Resource Group Policies
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Allowing wildcard admin actions in resource group policies poses significant
  security risks by granting overly broad permissions, potentially leading to data
  breaches or unauthorized access. Restricting wildcards ensures precise access control,
  aligns with the principle of least privilege, and minimizes the risk of inadvertent
  exposure of sensitive resources, thereby safeguarding organizational assets and
  maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that resource group policies within IBM Cloud do not
  include wildcards for admin actions, which could inadvertently grant excessive permissions.
  By enforcing specific action permissions instead of wildcards, this rule enhances
  security by ensuring that users and services have only the necessary privileges
  required for their roles. This practice not only strengthens the security posture
  by reducing the attack surface but also aids in compliance with regulatory frameworks
  that mandate strict access controls, such as ISO 27001 and GDPR.
