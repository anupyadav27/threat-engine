title: Enforce Granular Permissions by Restricting Wildcard Use in SCPs
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: This rule is crucial for maintaining a secure and controlled cloud environment
  by preventing overly permissive access policies that could lead to unauthorized
  access. Wildcards in Service Control Policies (SCPs) can inadvertently provide access
  to sensitive resources, increasing the risk of data breaches and violations of compliance
  standards.
description: The rule checks for the presence of wildcard characters in Service Control
  Policies (SCPs) applied to IBM Cloud resource groups, specifically focusing on blocking
  any "allow" statements with "*" on resources when "*" is used as a resource identifier.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations ensure that permissions are granted with precision,
  thereby minimizing potential security vulnerabilities. Implementing this granular
  control aligns with best practices in cloud security and governance, while also
  supporting compliance with regulations that mandate least privilege access.
