title: Ensure Config Rule Monitoring Enabled for Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling configuration rules for resource groups in IBM Cloud is crucial
  for maintaining compliance and governance standards across cloud resources. This
  ensures that any non-compliant configurations are promptly detected and addressed,
  minimizing potential security vulnerabilities and reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access or data breaches.
description: This rule checks whether configuration rules are enabled for resource
  groups managed by the resource_controller service in IBM Cloud. By ensuring these
  rules are active, organizations can continuously monitor the compliance status of
  their cloud resources. This proactive approach not only enhances the security posture
  but also aids in meeting regulatory requirements and internal governance policies.
  Enabling config rules provides visibility into configuration changes, helping to
  ensure that all resources adhere to predefined security policies.
