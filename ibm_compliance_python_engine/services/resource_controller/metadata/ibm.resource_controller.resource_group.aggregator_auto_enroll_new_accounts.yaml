rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.aggregator_auto_enroll_new_accounts
title: Ensure Auto Enrollment of New Accounts for Security Monitoring
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling auto enrollment of new accounts into security monitoring systems
  ensures that all resources are immediately subject to compliance checks and security
  oversight. This proactive approach reduces the risk of misconfigurations and unauthorized
  access, thereby protecting organizational assets and maintaining compliance with
  industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that new accounts in the IBM Cloud resource group
  are automatically enrolled in the security monitoring aggregator. By ensuring auto
  enrollment, organizations can guarantee that all new resources are immediately included
  in monitoring activities, which enhances visibility and control over their cloud
  environment. This practice supports compliance with regulatory requirements and
  internal security policies by ensuring continuous oversight and detection of potential
  security incidents as soon as new accounts are created.
