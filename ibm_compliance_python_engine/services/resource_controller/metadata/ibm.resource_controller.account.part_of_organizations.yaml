title: Ensure IBM Cloud Account is Integrated into Organizations for Governance
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Integrating an IBM Cloud account into an organization ensures centralized
  governance and management, enhancing security and operational oversight. This integration
  helps enforce policies, monitor compliance, and reduce the risk of misconfigurations
  or unauthorized access, thereby protecting organizational data and resources.
description: This rule verifies that an IBM Cloud account is part of an organization,
  which is crucial for implementing consistent security policies and compliance standards
  across all cloud resources. By being part of an organization, accounts can benefit
  from centralized identity and access management, unified billing, and consolidated
  monitoring. This setup facilitates streamlined security operations and ensures adherence
  to compliance frameworks, enhancing the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
