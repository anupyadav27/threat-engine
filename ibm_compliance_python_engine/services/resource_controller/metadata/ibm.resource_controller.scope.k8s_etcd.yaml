rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.scope.k8s_etcd
title: Ensure Secure Configuration of K8s Etcd in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: The security of the Etcd component in Kubernetes is crucial as it stores
  all cluster data, including secrets and configurations. A misconfigured Etcd can
  lead to unauthorized access and data breaches, impacting business continuity and
  compliance with data protection regulations. Ensuring its secure configuration mitigates
  risks associated with data interception and unauthorized modifications.
description: This rule checks the configuration of the Kubernetes Etcd component within
  IBM Cloud to ensure it adheres to recommended security best practices. Specifically,
  it verifies that Etcd is configured to use encrypted communication, employs authentication
  mechanisms, and restricts access to authorized users only. By enforcing these controls,
  the rule enhances data confidentiality and integrity, aligning with compliance standards
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS. Monitoring and maintaining the security posture of Etcd
  contributes to the overall resilience of containerized applications in the cloud
  environment.
