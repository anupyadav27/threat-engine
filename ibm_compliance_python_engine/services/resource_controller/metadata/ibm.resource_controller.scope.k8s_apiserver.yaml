rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.scope.k8s_apiserver
title: Ensure Secure Configuration of Kubernetes API Server in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Proper configuration of the Kubernetes API server is critical for maintaining
  the integrity and security of containerized applications. Misconfigurations can
  lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions, which could
  have significant business impacts including financial loss and reputational damage.
  Ensuring a secure setup helps in protecting sensitive workloads and maintaining
  compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks the configuration settings of the Kubernetes API server
  in IBM Cloud to ensure they adhere to best practices for security and compliance.
  Key aspects include verifying access controls, encryption settings, and network
  policies. By implementing these checks, the rule reduces the risk of unauthorized
  access and data exposure, while also aiding in compliance with regulations such
  as GDPR and HIPAA. Properly configured API servers limit the attack surface and
  enhance the overall security posture of your Kubernetes environment.
