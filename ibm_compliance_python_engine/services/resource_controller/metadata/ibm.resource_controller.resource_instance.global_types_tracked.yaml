title: Ensure Global Resource Types are Tracked in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Tracking global resource types is crucial for maintaining visibility and
  control over resource usage and configuration in IBM Cloud. Without proper tracking,
  organizations may face challenges in identifying misconfigurations, leading to potential
  security vulnerabilities. Ensuring global resource types are tracked supports compliance
  with security policies and enhances overall cloud governance.
description: This rule checks if all global resource types within the IBM Cloud Resource
  Controller are being tracked. By ensuring that global types are monitored, organizations
  can effectively manage and audit resource configurations, reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and data breaches. Implementing this rule helps in maintaining a clear audit
  trail, supporting compliance with industry standards and internal security policies,
  and ensures that resources are configured in line with best practices for cloud
  security.
