rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_instance.enabled
title: Ensure IBM Cloud Resource Instances are Enabled for Security Compliance
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling resource instances within IBM Cloud is crucial for maintaining
  operational efficiency and security compliance. Disabled instances may indicate
  misconfigurations or potential security risks, as they can lead to unexpected downtime
  or lack of resource availability. Ensuring instances are enabled helps in maintaining
  continuity of service and supports compliance with security policies and regulations.
description: This rule checks that all resource instances within the IBM Cloud are
  enabled, ensuring they are active and available for use as intended. Active instances
  are essential for preventing service interruptions and maintaining security posture,
  as disabled instances can lead to gaps in monitoring and management processes. Enabling
  instances also aligns with best practice frameworks for cloud computing, ensuring
  that resources are correctly configured and compliant with organizational security
  standards. This rule supports automated checks and alerts to prevent misconfigurations
  that could impact business operations or compliance objectives.
