title: Ensure Aggregator Org Aggregator is Enabled for Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Aggregator Org Aggregator in IBM Cloud enhances visibility
  and control over resource groups by aggregating security and compliance data across
  organizational boundaries. This capability is crucial for maintaining an effective
  security posture, enabling organizations to quickly identify and address potential
  risks, thereby minimizing the likelihood of security incidents and compliance breaches.
description: This rule verifies that the Aggregator Org Aggregator feature is enabled
  for resource groups within the IBM Cloud Resource Controller service. By consolidating
  security and compliance information, this feature allows for comprehensive monitoring
  and management across multiple organizational units. Enabling this feature helps
  organizations meet compliance requirements by providing a centralized view of their
  security posture, aiding in the detection of anomalies, and ensuring adherence to
  governance policies.
