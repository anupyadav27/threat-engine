title: Ensure Portfolios Are Shared Only Within the Organization
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting portfolio sharing to within the organization minimizes the
  risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It ensures that only trusted, internal
  stakeholders have access to sensitive resources, thereby maintaining data integrity
  and compliance with internal security policies. Limiting exposure helps prevent
  potential misuse or leakage of proprietary information, protecting both intellectual
  property and competitive advantage.
description: This security rule verifies that portfolios are configured to be shared
  only within the organization in IBM Cloud's Resource Controller. By enabling this
  setting, organizations ensure that sensitive cloud resources and configurations
  are not exposed to external entities. This practice enhances the overall security
  posture by maintaining strict access controls and supports compliance with governance
  standards that mandate data protection and privacy. Implementing this rule helps
  organizations adhere to best practices in cloud security and reduces the risk of
  accidental data exposure.
