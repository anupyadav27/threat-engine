rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.scp_mandatory_block_disabling_guardrail_services
title: Enforce Guardrail Services to Strengthen Disaster Recovery
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Enforcing the mandatory block on disabling guardrail services is crucial
  to maintaining a resilient cloud environment. It ensures that essential security
  and backup configurations remain active, preventing accidental or malicious disruptions.
  This rule mitigates risks associated with data loss and service outages, thereby
  protecting business continuity and reducing potential financial and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule evaluates IBM Cloud resource groups to ensure that guardrail
  services, which provide critical security and backup functions, cannot be disabled.
  By enforcing this guardrail, organizations can enhance their resilience against
  disruptions and ensure compliance with backup and disaster recovery policies. Implementing
  this rule helps maintain the integrity of backup configurations, thus supporting
  regulatory compliance and reducing the risk of data breaches or service interruptions.
