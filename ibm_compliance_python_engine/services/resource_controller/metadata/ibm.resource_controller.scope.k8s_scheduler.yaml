rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.scope.k8s_scheduler
title: Ensure Proper Configuration of Kubernetes Scheduler in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Proper configuration of the Kubernetes Scheduler is crucial for maintaining
  the security and efficiency of workloads running on IBM Cloud. Misconfigurations
  can lead to vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access and workload disruptions,
  which may result in operational inefficiencies and potential breaches. Ensuring
  that the scheduler is properly configured helps in maintaining a secure, resilient,
  and high-performing Kubernetes environment, thereby protecting business operations
  and data integrity.
description: This rule checks for the appropriate configuration settings of the Kubernetes
  Scheduler within the IBM Cloud environment. It ensures that the scheduler is running
  with secure parameters, such as appropriate access controls and resource constraints,
  to mitigate risks associated with workload scheduling and resource allocation. By
  adhering to this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by aligning
  with best practices and compliance standards, such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks,
  thereby reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access and operational downtime.
