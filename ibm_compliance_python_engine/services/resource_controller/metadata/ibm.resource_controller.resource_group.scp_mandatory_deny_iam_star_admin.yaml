rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.scp_mandatory_deny_iam_star_admin
title: Enforce Mandatory Denial of IAM Star Admin Permissions in IBM Cloud
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: This rule is critical to prevent excessive permissions that could lead
  to inadvertent or malicious changes across IBM Cloud resources. By denying IAM Star
  Admin permissions, organizations reduce the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized
  access, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity.
  Limiting permissions to the minimum necessary aligns with the principle of least
  privilege, which is crucial for maintaining robust security posture and compliance
  with industry standards.
description: The rule checks for any instances where the IAM Star Admin permissions
  are being assigned within the resource group. It enforces a mandatory denial of
  such broad permissions to prevent users from gaining unrestricted access that could
  compromise the security of the cloud environment. By implementing this rule, organizations
  ensure that users only have access to what is necessary for their role, thereby
  reducing the attack surface and potential for security breaches. This also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements by demonstrating adherence to security best practices
  and access control policies.
