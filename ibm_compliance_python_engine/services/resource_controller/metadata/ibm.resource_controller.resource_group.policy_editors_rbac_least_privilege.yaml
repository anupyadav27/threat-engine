title: Enforce Least Privilege for Policy Editors in IBM Cloud Resource Groups
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for policy editors in IBM
  Cloud resource groups minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. By ensuring that users have only the permissions necessary to perform
  their job functions, organizations can enhance security posture and reduce the attack
  surface, thereby safeguarding critical business assets.
description: This rule checks for adherence to the least privilege principle by verifying
  that policy editors within IBM Cloud resource groups have only the necessary permissions
  assigned to them. It assesses the configuration of role-based access control (RBAC)
  to ensure that users are not granted excessive privileges, which could lead to unauthorized
  actions or data exposure. Implementing this rule helps organizations maintain compliance
  with security best practices and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  by ensuring that access to resources is tightly controlled and auditable.
