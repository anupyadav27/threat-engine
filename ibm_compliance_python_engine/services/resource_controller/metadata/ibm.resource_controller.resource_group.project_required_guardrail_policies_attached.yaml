title: Enforce Guardrail Policies for Project Resilience in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Guardrail policies are essential for ensuring that all projects within
  a resource group adhere to predefined security and compliance standards. By attaching
  these policies, organizations can mitigate risks related to data loss and service
  disruptions, thereby enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of their cloud
  deployments. This rule is crucial for maintaining compliance with industry standards
  and protecting critical business processes.
description: This rule verifies that each resource group on the IBM Cloud has the
  required guardrail policies attached to its projects. By ensuring these policies
  are in place, organizations can enforce consistent backup configurations and disaster
  recovery plans across all resources. This not only bolsters security posture by
  standardizing recovery procedures but also aids in meeting compliance mandates like
  GDPR and ISO 27001, which demand robust data protection and continuity measures.
  Implementing this rule helps prevent configuration drift and ensures that projects
  are prepared for unexpected failures.
