rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.aggregation_authorization_present_and_valid
title: Ensure Aggregation Authorization is Present and Valid for Resource Groups
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Proper management of aggregation authorizations within IBM Cloud resource
  groups is critical to maintaining secure access controls. Without valid aggregation
  authorizations, unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive data or resources,
  leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule verifies that aggregation authorizations for resource groups
  in the IBM Cloud are both present and valid, ensuring that any aggregation of resources
  or data is performed only by authorized entities. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can enhance their security posture by preventing unauthorized access and manipulation
  of aggregated resources. This contributes to maintaining compliance with best practices
  in identity and access management, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents
  and ensuring data integrity across cloud environments.
