title: Enforce Secure Destination for IBM Cloud Resource Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring secure destinations for IBM Cloud resource instances is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Improperly secured destinations
  can lead to potential exposure of sensitive information, undermining customer trust
  and violating compliance requirements. By securing resource destinations, organizations
  can effectively mitigate risks associated with data exfiltration and maintain robust
  network security.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud resource instances have secure destination
  configurations, ensuring that communication is restricted to known, trusted endpoints.
  By enforcing secure destinations, organizations can enhance their network access
  control measures, thereby reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized
  data flows. This practice not only fortifies the security posture of the cloud environment
  but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001
  and PCI DSS, which mandate stringent network security controls.
