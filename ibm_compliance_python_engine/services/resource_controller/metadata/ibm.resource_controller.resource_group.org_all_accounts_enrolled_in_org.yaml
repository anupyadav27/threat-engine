title: Ensure All Accounts Are Enrolled in Organization for Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that all accounts are enrolled in the organization is crucial
  for maintaining a centralized governance and security posture. It prevents unauthorized
  access and ensures that all resources comply with organizational policies, reducing
  the risk of security breaches and data leaks. This measure helps in maintaining
  visibility and control over the entire cloud environment, thereby supporting compliance
  with industry standards.
description: This security rule verifies that every account associated with resource
  groups within the IBM Cloud is enrolled in the organization. By validating account
  enrollment, it enhances security by ensuring that only vetted and authorized accounts
  have access to organizational resources. This practice aids in the enforcement of
  consistent security policies and governance standards across all cloud resources,
  aligning with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regularly monitoring
  and updating account enrollments can prevent unauthorized access and reduce the
  risk of configuration drifts.
