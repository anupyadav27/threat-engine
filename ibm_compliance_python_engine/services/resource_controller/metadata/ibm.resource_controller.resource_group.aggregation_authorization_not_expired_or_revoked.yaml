rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.aggregation_authorization_not_expired_or_revoked
title: Ensure Active and Valid Aggregation Authorization for Resource Groups
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that aggregation authorizations for IBM Cloud resource groups
  are neither expired nor revoked is crucial for maintaining secure access controls.
  Expired or revoked authorizations can lead to unauthorized access or disruptions
  in service access, which could impact business operations and compromise sensitive
  data.
description: This rule checks that all aggregation authorizations associated with
  resource groups in IBM Cloud are current and have not been revoked. It ensures that
  only valid and authorized entities can perform actions across aggregated resources,
  thus enhancing the security posture by preventing unauthorized activities. Compliance
  with this rule helps organizations meet regulatory requirements and internal policies
  related to access management and ensures consistent enforcement of security controls
  across the cloud environment.
