rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.kms_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for Resource Groups
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for resource groups is
  crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. It ensures that all
  data at rest within the IBM Cloud infrastructure is encrypted, thereby safeguarding
  it against potential breaches and aligning with industry compliance standards such
  as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud resource groups have encryption at
  rest enabled through the Key Management Service (KMS). By enforcing KMS encryption,
  data within resource groups is secured using robust cryptographic methods, thus
  enhancing data privacy and security. This practice not only mitigates the risk of
  data exposure in the event of unauthorized access but also helps meet regulatory
  compliance requirements by ensuring that data is encrypted with strong encryption
  keys managed by KMS. Regular compliance checks for KMS encryption reinforce data
  protection strategies and help maintain the integrity of sensitive information.
