rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.destination_access_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Resource Group Access in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for resource group access
  is crucial to minimizing potential security risks. By granting only the necessary
  permissions required for users to perform their tasks, organizations can reduce
  the attack surface and limit the impact of any potential breaches. This approach
  not only enhances security but also ensures compliance with industry standards and
  regulations.
description: This rule evaluates access permissions to resource groups within the
  IBM Cloud, ensuring that users and services have only the minimum permissions necessary
  to perform their functions. By scrutinizing the access levels granted, this rule
  helps prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Adhering to this
  rule aids in meeting compliance requirements such as those set by GDPR, HIPAA, and
  other regulatory frameworks by demonstrating a commitment to secure access management
  practices.
