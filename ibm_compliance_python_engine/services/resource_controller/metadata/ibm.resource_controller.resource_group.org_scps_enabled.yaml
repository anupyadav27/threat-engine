rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.org_scps_enabled
title: Mandatory Activation of Organizational Security Policies (SCPs)
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling Organizational Security Policies (SCPs) is crucial as it ensures
  that all cloud resources within an organization adhere to predefined security and
  compliance policies. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and configuration
  vulnerabilities, which can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. Implementing
  SCPs helps maintain a secure and compliant cloud environment, safeguarding sensitive
  data and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that Organizational Security Policies (SCPs) are enabled
  for all resource groups within the IBM Cloud. SCPs act as guardrails that enforce
  security and compliance best practices across the organization, ensuring that resource
  configurations align with corporate policies. By mandating SCPs, this rule mitigates
  risks associated with misconfigurations and unauthorized access, thereby enhancing
  the security posture and compliance readiness of the cloud environment. Regular
  monitoring and enforcement of SCPs contribute to a robust security framework and
  assist in meeting regulatory requirements.
