rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.scp_mandatory_require_mfa_for_console_where_supported
title: Enforce MFA for IBM Cloud Console Access to Enhance Security
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is a crucial security measure that drastically
  reduces the risk of unauthorized access to cloud resources. By ensuring that all
  console logins require MFA where supported, organizations can protect sensitive
  data and maintain compliance with industry standards, which is vital for safeguarding
  business operations and customer trust.
description: This rule mandates the enforcement of MFA for IBM Cloud console access,
  specifically targeting resource groups managed by the Resource Controller service.
  It checks for configurations where MFA is supported and ensures that it is enabled.
  Implementing MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide
  two or more verification factors, thereby reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
  This not only strengthens the security posture but also helps organizations meet
  regulatory compliance requirements and best practices for identity and access management.
