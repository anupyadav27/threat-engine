title: Ensure Kubernetes RBAC Policies are Configured for Resource Access
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is crucial for
  managing permissions and access to resources within an IBM Cloud environment. Proper
  RBAC configuration helps prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  maintaining both data integrity and confidentiality. This safeguards business operations
  and helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements by ensuring only authorized
  personnel have access to critical resources.
description: This rule checks the configuration of Kubernetes RBAC policies within
  the IBM Cloud Resource Controller to ensure that access permissions are explicitly
  defined for each role. By verifying that RBAC is properly set up, this rule ensures
  that users and services have appropriate access levels, thus enforcing the principle
  of least privilege. This enhances the overall security posture by minimizing the
  risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access, which in turn supports compliance
  with industry standards and best practices.
