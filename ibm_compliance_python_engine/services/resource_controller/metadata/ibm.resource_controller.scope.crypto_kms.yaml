title: Ensure Encryption at Rest with IBM Cloud Key Management Service
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring data encryption at rest is crucial to protect sensitive information
  from unauthorized access and data breaches. Leveraging IBM Cloud Key Management
  Service (KMS) provides an additional layer of security by managing the encryption
  keys used to protect data. This practice not only mitigates risks associated with
  data exposure but also aligns with industry standards and compliance requirements,
  thereby safeguarding business integrity and customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether resources in IBM Cloud utilize the IBM Cloud
  Key Management Service for encrypting data at rest. By enforcing the use of KMS,
  organizations can ensure that their encryption keys are managed securely, reducing
  the risk of unauthorized data access. Implementing encryption at rest through KMS
  enhances security by ensuring that data is encrypted using strong algorithms and
  that keys are rotated and managed according to best practices. This approach supports
  compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring
  that sensitive data is adequately protected.
