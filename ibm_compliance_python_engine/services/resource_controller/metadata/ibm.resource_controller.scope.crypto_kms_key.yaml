title: Enforce Encryption at Rest with IBM Cloud KMS Keys
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that all sensitive data stored within IBM Cloud is encrypted at
  rest is crucial for protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches. Utilizing
  IBM Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) allows organizations to maintain robust encryption
  strategies, thereby safeguarding data privacy and meeting regulatory compliance
  requirements. Failure to encrypt data at rest can result in significant business
  repercussions, including financial penalties and loss of customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all resources managed by the IBM Cloud Resource
  Controller are encrypted using keys provided by IBM Cloud Key Management Service
  (KMS). By enforcing the use of KMS keys, organizations can ensure that data is encrypted
  using industry-standard encryption algorithms, which enhances the security posture
  of stored data. This setup not only improves the overall security framework by protecting
  sensitive information but also aids in achieving compliance with data protection
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular compliance with this rule ensures that
  encryption is consistently applied to data at rest, reducing the risk of data exposure.
