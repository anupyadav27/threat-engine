rule_id: ibm.resource_controller.resource_group.project_security_services_mandatory_enabled
title: Enforce Security Services in IBM Cloud Resource Groups
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that security services are mandatory for IBM Cloud resource groups
  is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. This requirement helps prevent
  unauthorized access and data breaches by enforcing consistent security controls
  across all resources. Moreover, it supports compliance with industry regulations
  and standards, reducing the risk of legal and financial repercussions for the organization.
description: This rule checks whether security services, such as access management
  and logging, are enabled for all resource groups within the IBM Cloud environment.
  By mandating these services, organizations can enhance their ability to monitor
  and respond to security incidents, ensuring that potential threats are detected
  and mitigated promptly. This proactive approach not only bolsters security but also
  aids in achieving compliance with various regulations and standards. Enforcing this
  rule helps maintain a consistent security baseline across the cloud infrastructure,
  ultimately safeguarding sensitive data and business operations.
