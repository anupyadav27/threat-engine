title: Enforce Regional Restrictions via Policy for IBM Cloud Resources
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing regional restrictions through policy management is crucial
  to ensure that cloud resources comply with geographical data residency and sovereignty
  requirements. This control mitigates risks associated with unauthorized data access
  and processing in non-compliant regions, thus protecting sensitive information and
  maintaining trust with stakeholders.
description: This rule verifies that policies are in place to restrict the usage of
  IBM Cloud resources to specified regions as required by organizational or regulatory
  mandates. By enforcing geographic constraints on resource deployment, this control
  helps prevent data from being stored or processed in locations that may not comply
  with legal, regulatory, or organizational policies. This practice enhances security
  by reducing the attack surface and aligns with compliance standards that require
  data localization, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
