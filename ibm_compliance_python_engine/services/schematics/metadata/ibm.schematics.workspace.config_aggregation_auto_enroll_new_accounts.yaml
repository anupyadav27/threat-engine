title: Ensure Auto Enrollment in Config Aggregation for New Accounts
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling auto enrollment for new accounts in configuration aggregation
  within IBM Schematics Workspace is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive security
  posture. It ensures that new accounts are automatically monitored and assessed for
  compliance and security risks, reducing the likelihood of configuration drifts and
  vulnerabilities. By proactively aggregating configurations, organizations can enhance
  their visibility and streamline audits, avoiding potential financial and reputational
  losses.
description: This rule checks whether new accounts are automatically enrolled in configuration
  aggregation in IBM Schematics Workspace. By enabling this feature, organizations
  can ensure that all newly created accounts are included in ongoing security and
  compliance assessments. This proactive approach helps in maintaining consistency
  in security configurations across the cloud environment, thereby reducing the risk
  of non-compliance with industry standards and regulations. Implementing this rule
  supports continuous security monitoring and governance, providing a robust mechanism
  for early detection of security misconfigurations.
