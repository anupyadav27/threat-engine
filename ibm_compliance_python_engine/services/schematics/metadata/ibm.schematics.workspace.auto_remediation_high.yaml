title: Enable Auto Remediation for High-Risk Schematics Workspace Issues
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling auto remediation for high-risk issues in IBM Schematics workspaces
  is crucial for maintaining the security posture of cloud environments. This automated
  approach helps to quickly address vulnerabilities, reducing the window of exposure
  to potential threats. It ensures business continuity by preventing misconfigurations
  from escalating into significant security incidents.
description: This rule mandates the activation of auto remediation for high-severity
  issues detected within IBM Schematics workspaces. It involves configuring the system
  to automatically apply predefined corrective actions when a high-risk security issue
  is identified. This proactive approach enhances the overall security framework by
  minimizing human intervention, thus reducing the risk of delayed responses or oversight.
  Moreover, it aligns with compliance frameworks that require continuous monitoring
  and swift response to security vulnerabilities, thereby supporting organizational
  governance and regulatory adherence.
