title: Ensure IKS Version Upgrade is Enabled for Secure Patch Management
severity: medium
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Enabling version upgrades for IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) is critical
  to maintaining a secure and stable cloud environment. It ensures that the Kubernetes
  clusters are protected against known vulnerabilities and benefit from the latest
  features and performance improvements. Failing to upgrade can lead to security breaches,
  downtime, and non-compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule verifies that the IKS version upgrade feature is enabled within
  IBM Schematics workspaces, ensuring that Kubernetes clusters are kept up-to-date
  with the latest patches and security enhancements. By enabling automatic version
  upgrades, organizations can mitigate risks associated with outdated software, reducing
  the attack surface and enhancing overall cloud security posture. This practice supports
  compliance with security frameworks that mandate regular software updates and vulnerability
  management.
