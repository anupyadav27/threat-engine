title: Enable Config Aggregation for Organizational Security Monitoring
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that configuration aggregation is enabled within IBM Cloud Schematics
  workspaces is crucial for maintaining comprehensive security visibility across the
  organization. This practice aids in identifying configuration drifts and potential
  vulnerabilities, facilitating proactive security measures. It supports compliance
  by ensuring that configurations adhere to organizational policies and regulatory
  standards.
description: This rule checks whether configuration aggregation is enabled for IBM
  Cloud Schematics workspaces within the organization. By aggregating configuration
  data at the organizational level, security teams can gain a holistic view of the
  operational environment, allowing for more effective monitoring and management of
  security policies. This practice enhances the ability to detect unauthorized changes
  and ensures alignment with compliance requirements such as GDPR and PCI DSS, ultimately
  reducing the risk of security breaches and non-compliance penalties.
