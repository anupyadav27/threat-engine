title: Ensure Config Baseline Parameters Are Set for Schematics Workspaces
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Establishing configuration baseline parameters for IBM Cloud Schematics
  workspaces is critical to maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment.
  These baselines help in identifying deviations from the expected configuration standards,
  reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensuring adherence to organizational
  compliance requirements. Implementing configuration baselines aids in minimizing
  business risks by ensuring that infrastructure is consistently deployed and maintained
  according to approved policies.
description: This rule verifies that configuration baseline parameters are set for
  IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. By doing so, it ensures that the infrastructure
  as code (IaC) deployments adhere to predefined security and compliance standards.
  This check helps in detecting configuration drifts and unauthorized changes, thereby
  enhancing the security posture of the cloud environment. By enforcing configuration
  baselines, organizations can achieve better governance and automated compliance
  checks, aligning with industry best practices and regulatory mandates.
