title: Enforce Least Privilege Access in IBM Schematics Workspaces
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for IBM Schematics workspaces is crucial
  for minimizing security risks by ensuring users and services only have access to
  the resources necessary for their functions. This approach reduces the attack surface,
  limits potential exposure to breaches, and helps in maintaining strict control over
  sensitive data and operations. By adhering to this principle, organizations can
  prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential business impacts from security
  incidents.
description: This rule ensures that access permissions to IBM Schematics workspaces
  are configured following the principle of least privilege. It checks that users
  and applications are granted only the minimum levels of access necessary to perform
  their tasks. By doing so, it enhances overall security posture by reducing unnecessary
  permissions that could be exploited by malicious actors. Compliance with this rule
  supports adherence to best practices in identity and access management, thereby
  contributing to a robust cloud security framework and facilitating regulatory compliance.
