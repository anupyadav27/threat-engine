title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for IBM Schematics Workspaces
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for IBM Schematics workspaces
  is critical for safeguarding sensitive data. Without encryption, data at rest is
  vulnerable to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches and compliance
  violations. Encrypted workspaces ensure that any data stored is protected using
  robust cryptographic methods, thereby maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.
description: This rule verifies that KMS encryption is enabled for IBM Schematics
  workspaces to protect data at rest. It checks for the presence of an active KMS
  instance linked to the workspace, ensuring that data is encrypted using keys managed
  by IBM's secure KMS infrastructure. Enforcing KMS encryption enhances the security
  posture by mitigating risks of data leakage and unauthorized access, and supports
  compliance with industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which mandate
  data protection measures.
