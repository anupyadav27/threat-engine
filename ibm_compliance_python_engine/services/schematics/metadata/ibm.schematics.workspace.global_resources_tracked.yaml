title: Ensure Global Resources Are Tracked in IBM Schematics Workspaces
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Tracking global resources within IBM Schematics workspaces is crucial for
  maintaining an organized and secure cloud environment. Proper tracking enables organizations
  to monitor resource usage effectively, ensuring compliance with governance policies
  and preventing unauthorized access or resource sprawl, which can have significant
  business implications, including increased operational costs and security vulnerabilities.
description: This rule evaluates whether global resources in IBM Schematics workspaces
  are being adequately tracked. By ensuring that all resources are accounted for,
  organizations can maintain a clear overview of their infrastructure, enhancing security
  posture by identifying and mitigating potential risks. This practice supports compliance
  with governance standards by providing visibility into resource allocations and
  usage patterns, facilitating efficient management and auditing processes.
