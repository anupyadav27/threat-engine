title: Ensure Config Baseline Conformance Pack is Deployed in Schematics Workspace
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Deploying a Config Baseline Conformance Pack in IBM Cloud Schematics ensures
  that the workspace configurations adhere to organizational security and compliance
  standards. It helps prevent configuration drift, which can lead to vulnerabilities
  and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements, thereby reducing the
  risk of data breaches and financial penalties.
description: This rule checks whether a Config Baseline Conformance Pack is deployed
  within IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. By verifying the presence of these conformance
  packs, organizations can standardize configurations across their cloud environments,
  ensuring they align with predefined security and compliance policies. This practice
  not only bolsters the security posture by maintaining configurations in a controlled
  manner but also supports compliance efforts by providing a structured approach to
  monitor and enforce policy adherence. Implementing this rule aids in identifying
  deviations from established baselines, facilitating timely remediation and continuous
  security monitoring.
