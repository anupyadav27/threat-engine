rule_id: ibm.schematics.workspace.secure_destination
title: Ensure Secure Destination for IBM Schematics Workspaces
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Schematics workspaces have secure destinations is critical
  for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of automated infrastructure
  deployments. A secure destination prevents unauthorized access and data breaches,
  which can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for businesses.
  By enforcing this rule, organizations can mitigate risks associated with exposure
  of sensitive configurations and scripts.
description: This rule checks that all destinations configured in IBM Schematics workspaces
  are secure, which typically involves verifying that connections are encrypted and
  endpoints are authenticated. By enforcing secure destinations, the rule ensures
  that data in transit is protected from interception and unauthorized modifications.
  This enhances overall network security and aligns with compliance standards requiring
  encryption and secure data handling practices. Compliance with this rule benefits
  organizations by reducing vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors in their
  cloud infrastructure.
