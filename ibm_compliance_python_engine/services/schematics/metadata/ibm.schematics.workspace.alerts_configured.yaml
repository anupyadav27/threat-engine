title: Ensure Alerts are Configured for IBM Schematics Workspaces
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alerts for IBM Schematics workspaces is crucial to promptly
  identify and respond to security incidents or operational issues. Alerts help in
  maintaining the integrity and availability of the infrastructure by notifying administrators
  of potential vulnerabilities or anomalies. This proactive approach aids in mitigating
  risks and ensuring compliance with security standards.
description: This rule verifies whether alerts are configured for IBM Schematics workspaces,
  ensuring that administrators receive timely notifications about significant events.
  By setting up alerts, organizations can monitor for unauthorized changes, resource
  misconfigurations, and other potential security threats. This practice not only
  enhances the security posture by enabling rapid incident response but also supports
  compliance with audit logging standards by maintaining a comprehensive record of
  workspace activities.
