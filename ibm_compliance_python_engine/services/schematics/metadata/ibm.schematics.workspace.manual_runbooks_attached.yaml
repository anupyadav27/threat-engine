title: Ensure Manual Runbooks are Attached to Schematics Workspaces
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Attaching manual runbooks to IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces is critical
  for maintaining a consistent and repeatable process for managing infrastructure
  changes. This practice helps to mitigate risks associated with ad-hoc changes, ensuring
  that all modifications are documented and can be reviewed or audited. This enhances
  operational transparency and reduces the potential for human error, which can lead
  to security vulnerabilities and compliance breaches.
description: This rule checks whether manual runbooks are attached to IBM Schematics
  workspaces. Manual runbooks provide a detailed sequence of steps and procedures
  that should be followed to execute tasks within the workspace, ensuring that all
  actions are performed consistently and securely. By attaching runbooks, organizations
  can enforce standardized processes, thereby improving security posture and compliance
  with governance standards. This practice is particularly beneficial for audit trails,
  as it provides a comprehensive documentation of changes and procedures applied to
  the cloud infrastructure.
