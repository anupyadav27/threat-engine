title: Enable Drift Detection for IBM Schematics Workspaces
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Enabling drift detection in IBM Schematics workspaces is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and consistency of infrastructure deployments. Drift detection helps
  identify changes in the infrastructure that occur outside of the defined automation
  processes, which could lead to configuration mismatches, potential security vulnerabilities,
  or compliance issues. Ensuring drift detection is enabled enhances the resilience
  of your system and supports effective disaster recovery planning by maintaining
  up-to-date and accurate environment configurations.
description: This rule checks whether drift detection is enabled for IBM Schematics
  workspaces, ensuring that any changes made outside of the defined infrastructure
  as code (IaC) processes are identified and managed. Enabling drift detection allows
  for the automatic monitoring and reporting of infrastructure changes, facilitating
  prompt corrective actions when discrepancies are found. This capability is vital
  for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment, as it reduces the risk
  of unauthorized changes leading to configuration drift, which can compromise the
  security posture and operational effectiveness of the cloud resources.
