title: Ensure IBM Schematics Workspaces Are Enabled for Security Monitoring
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling IBM Schematics workspaces is crucial for maintaining an organized
  and secure infrastructure management process. It ensures that your infrastructure
  as code is consistently monitored, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and unauthorized
  changes that could lead to vulnerabilities. This proactive approach aids in maintaining
  compliance with industry standards and regulations, thereby safeguarding business
  integrity and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Schematics workspaces are enabled, ensuring
  that infrastructure deployments and configurations are actively managed and monitored.
  By having workspaces enabled, organizations can leverage IBM Schematics to automate
  the deployment and management of cloud resources, which enhances security by providing
  visibility and control over infrastructure changes. This practice supports compliance
  by enabling traceability and accountability in configuration management, thereby
  reducing the likelihood of configuration drift and enhancing the overall security
  posture of the cloud environment.
