title: Certificate Expiration and Deprecated SSL Protocols Compliance Check
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that SSL/TLS certificates are valid and do not use deprecated
  protocols is crucial for maintaining secure communications over the internet. Expired
  certificates or those using insecure protocols expose organizations to potential
  data breaches and non-compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR.
  This can lead to customer trust loss and legal penalties.
description: This rule checks for the expiration dates of SSL/TLS certificates and
  identifies any that are using deprecated SSL protocols within IBM Cloud's Certificate
  Manager service. By ensuring certificates are valid and utilize secure protocols,
  organizations can protect sensitive data in transit from interception and unauthorized
  access. Additionally, compliance with industry security standards is maintained,
  enhancing overall data protection and privacy within the cloud environment.
