title: Ensuring Certificate Expiration Monitoring in IBM Certificate Manager
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring the expiration of SSL/TLS certificates is crucial to prevent
  service disruptions, data breaches, and loss of customer trust. An expired certificate
  can lead to unencrypted data transmission, making sensitive information vulnerable
  to interception and unauthorized access. Proactively monitoring these certificates
  enhances business continuity and compliance with security standards.
description: This rule verifies that all SSL/TLS certificates managed within IBM Certificate
  Manager are actively monitored for expiration dates. By ensuring certificates are
  not permitted to expire unnoticed, this rule helps maintain encrypted data exchanges
  and prevents potential security incidents due to expired certificates. Implementing
  this monitoring aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  for secure data transmission, providing both security and compliance benefits.
