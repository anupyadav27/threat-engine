title: Ensure Certificate Expiration Monitoring with IBM Flow Logs Enabled
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Monitoring certificate expiration is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and trust of communications over secure channels. Enabling IBM Flow Logs for certificates
  allows organizations to proactively manage and address certificate expiration issues,
  preventing potential disruptions and reputational damage due to expired certificates.
description: This rule ensures that IBM Certificate Manager has flow logs enabled
  to monitor the expiration of certificates. By tracking the certificate lifecycle,
  organizations can receive alerts and take timely actions to renew or replace certificates
  before they expire. This proactive monitoring not only strengthens the security
  posture by avoiding service interruptions but also aids in compliance with industry
  standards that mandate regular auditing and logging of security-related events.
  Enabling flow logs for certificate expiration checks supports effective audit logging,
  helping organizations maintain a comprehensive security and compliance strategy.
