title: Ensure Project Logging is Enabled for Continuous Delivery Resources
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling project logging for continuous delivery resources is crucial for
  maintaining transparency and traceability within the deployment pipeline. It provides
  insights into the activities and changes occurring within the environment, allowing
  for better incident response and accountability. Without logging, organizations
  risk not having visibility into potential security breaches or misconfigurations,
  which can lead to data loss or compliance violations.
description: This security rule checks whether logging is enabled for continuous delivery
  resources within IBM Cloud projects. By ensuring logging is active, organizations
  can monitor and record all actions and changes, thus enhancing their ability to
  detect and respond to security incidents. This practice supports compliance with
  industry standards and regulations by providing a documented audit trail of changes
  and access, which is essential for audits and security assessments.
