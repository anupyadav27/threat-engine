rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.resource.project_source_repo_url_enabled
title: Ensure Project Source Repository URL is Enabled in Continuous Delivery
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Project Source Repository URL in IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery
  is crucial for maintaining traceability and accountability in software development
  processes. This feature ensures that the source code's origin can be tracked, which
  aids in auditing and compliance efforts. Without this, organizations risk potential
  security breaches due to untracked and unauthorized code changes, impacting both
  operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.
description: This security rule checks whether the Project Source Repository URL is
  enabled within an IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery resource. Enabling this feature
  ensures that all code deployments are linked to their respective source repositories,
  allowing for improved monitoring and auditing capabilities. By maintaining a clear
  linkage between deployed code and its source, organizations can enhance their security
  posture by ensuring that only authorized changes are made to production environments.
  Additionally, this practice supports compliance with industry standards and regulations
  by providing a transparent and verifiable code deployment trail.
