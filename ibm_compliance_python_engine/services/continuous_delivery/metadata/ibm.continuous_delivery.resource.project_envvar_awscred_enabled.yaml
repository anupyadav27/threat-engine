rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.resource.project_envvar_awscred_enabled
title: Ensure AWS Credentials in Project Environment Variables Are Disabled
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling AWS credentials within project environment variables can pose
  a security risk by inadvertently exposing sensitive credentials to unauthorized
  users or services. This exposure can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources,
  potentially resulting in data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
  Ensuring these credentials are disabled enhances the security posture by reducing
  attack vectors and aligning with best practices for secure cloud operations.
description: This rule checks for the presence of AWS credentials within the environment
  variables of IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery projects. By ensuring that AWS credentials
  are not stored in these variables, the rule helps mitigate the risk of accidental
  exposure to unauthorized users, thus enhancing the project's security. This practice
  also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate secure
  handling of access credentials, ensuring that sensitive data is protected against
  unauthorized access.
