rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.project_older_90_days.project_age_90_days_maximum
title: Enforce 90-Day Maximum Age for Continuous Delivery Projects
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Limiting the age of continuous delivery projects to 90 days mitigates risks
  associated with outdated configurations and deprecated code that may introduce vulnerabilities.
  Regularly reviewing and updating projects ensures they adhere to the latest security
  and compliance standards, reducing the risk of exposure to security threats and
  ensuring alignment with governance policies.
description: This rule checks if continuous delivery projects exceed an age of 90
  days, emphasizing the need for periodic review and updates. By enforcing a maximum
  project age, the rule ensures that organizations maintain an up-to-date security
  posture and remain compliant with regulatory requirements. This practice helps detect
  and remediate potential vulnerabilities in aging projects, enhances the security
  monitoring process, and supports governance efforts.
