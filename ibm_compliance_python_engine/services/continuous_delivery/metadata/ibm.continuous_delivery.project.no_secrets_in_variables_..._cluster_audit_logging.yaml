title: Ensure Secrets Are Not Stored in Cluster Audit Logging Variables
severity: high
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Storing secrets in cluster audit logging variables can inadvertently expose
  sensitive information, leading to potential security breaches. This practice can
  compromise the integrity of an organization's security posture by making confidential
  data accessible to unauthorized users. Ensuring that secrets are not included in
  logging variables is crucial for maintaining compliance with industry standards
  and protecting business-critical information.
description: This security rule verifies that sensitive information, such as API keys,
  passwords, and tokens, is not embedded within the cluster audit logging variables
  in IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery projects. By checking for the presence of secrets
  in logging configurations, this control helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
  data and reduces the risk of exposure in audit logs. Adhering to this rule not only
  strengthens data protection measures but also aids in achieving compliance with
  regulatory requirements and best practices in cloud security management.
