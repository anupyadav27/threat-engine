rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.project_artifact_encryption.project_artifact_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption of Continuous Delivery Project Artifacts
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for project artifacts in IBM Cloud's Continuous Delivery
  service is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and intellectual property. Unencrypted
  artifacts are vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, which
  can lead to significant financial losses and damage to the organization's reputation.
  Ensuring encryption at rest protects data integrity and confidentiality, aligning
  with compliance requirements and enhancing overall data security.
description: This rule checks that encryption is enabled for project artifacts within
  the Continuous Delivery service on IBM Cloud. Enabling encryption ensures that all
  data stored as part of a project artifact is encrypted at rest, thereby protecting
  it from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice not only
  enhances data security but also helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of sensitive data through robust
  encryption methods.
