title: Ensure COS Logs Encryption for Continuous Delivery Projects
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting COS logs for Continuous Delivery projects is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Unencrypted logs
  can expose critical information, leading to compliance violations and reputational
  damage. Ensuring encryption at rest enhances data confidentiality and integrity,
  aligning with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
description: This rule verifies that the logs from Continuous Delivery projects stored
  in IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) are encrypted at rest. It checks for the configuration
  ensuring that all COS logs are using encryption algorithms to secure data against
  unauthorized access. Implementing this rule strengthens the overall security posture
  by safeguarding data against potential threats, while also aiding in compliance
  with data protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Encrypted logs protect sensitive
  information from being exposed, thus mitigating risks associated with data breaches
  and maintaining customer trust.
