rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.project.source_repo_url_no_..._secrets_in_variables
title: Prevent Secrets in Continuous Delivery Project Source Repo URLs
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that secrets are not embedded within source repository URLs in
  Continuous Delivery projects is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and
  integrity of sensitive data. Exposing secrets in URLs can lead to unauthorized access
  and potential data breaches, severely impacting business operations and compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks for the presence of secrets within the source repository
  URLs configured in Continuous Delivery projects. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can mitigate the risk of unintentional exposure of sensitive information such as
  API keys, passwords, or tokens that could be exploited by malicious actors. Adhering
  to this security measure not only enhances the overall security posture but also
  aids in achieving compliance with industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS,
  which mandate strict control over sensitive data handling and storage.
