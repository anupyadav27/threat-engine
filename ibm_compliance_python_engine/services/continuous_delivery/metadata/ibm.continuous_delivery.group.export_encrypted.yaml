  groups is encrypted at rest, aligning with best practices for data protection and
  privacy. By verifying that encryption is applied, this control helps safeguard sensitive
  datasets against unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Implementing this
  rule enhances the organization's security posture and aids in meeting regulatory
  compliance requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that data is adequately
  protected both in transit and when stored.
