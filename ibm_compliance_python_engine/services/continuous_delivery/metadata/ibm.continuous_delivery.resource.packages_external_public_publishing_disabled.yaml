rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.resource.packages_external_public_publishing_disabled
title: Disable External Public Publishing for Continuous Delivery Packages
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Disabling external public publishing of packages in continuous delivery
  environments is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Allowing public access to packages can expose sensitive code and resources, increasing
  the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can maintain control over their software distribution, ensuring that only authorized
  individuals have access to critical components, thereby safeguarding intellectual
  property and meeting compliance requirements.
description: This security rule ensures that all packages within the IBM Cloud Continuous
  Delivery service are restricted from being published to external public repositories.
  The check verifies that configurations are in place to prevent public access, thereby
  reducing the attack surface and minimizing the risk of unauthorized data exposure.
  Implementing this rule not only enhances the security posture by preventing potential
  leaks of sensitive information but also aids in achieving compliance with industry
  standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict access controls
  on sensitive data.
