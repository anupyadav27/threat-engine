rule_id: ibm.continuous_delivery.user.controlled_buildspec
title: Enforce Secure and Verified Buildspec in Continuous Delivery
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that build specifications (buildspecs) in Continuous Delivery
  services are controlled and verified by authorized users is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and security of the development pipeline. Uncontrolled buildspecs
  can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential data breaches, and compromised
  application deployments, which can severely impact business operations and trust.
description: This rule checks that buildspec files within the Continuous Delivery
  service are only modifiable by authorized users with appropriate permissions. By
  controlling access to buildspecs, organizations can prevent unauthorized alterations
  that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code into the deployment process.
  This practice not only strengthens the security of the CI/CD pipeline but also aligns
  with compliance requirements by ensuring that only verified and accountable personnel
  can modify critical deployment configurations.
