rule_id: ibm.activity_tracker.event.public_access_blocked
title: Enforce Public Access Restriction on Activity Tracker Events
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to Activity Tracker events is crucial to safeguard
  sensitive audit and monitoring data from unauthorized access. Exposure of these
  events can lead to security breaches, as they contain detailed logs of user activities
  and system changes, which can be exploited by malicious actors. Ensuring these events
  are inaccessible to the public helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive information, thereby protecting business operations and reputation.
description: This security rule verifies that public access to Activity Tracker events
  is blocked, ensuring that only authorized users within the organization can view
  and manage these logs. By restricting public access, the rule mitigates the risk
  of unauthorized data exposure and potential exploitation of sensitive audit logs.
  Implementing this control aligns with compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which require robust access management and data protection measures. Regularly auditing
  this configuration helps maintain a strong security posture and supports adherence
  to regulatory requirements.
