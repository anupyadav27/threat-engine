rule_id: ibm.activity_tracker.event.tracker_kms_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure KMS Encryption is Enabled for Activity Tracker Events
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for Activity Tracker events
  is critical to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches. This practice helps maintain data integrity and confidentiality, which
  are essential for compliance with data protection regulations and standards like
  GDPR and HIPAA. A failure to encrypt data at rest could result in significant financial
  penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule checks whether the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service has enabled
  encryption for event data using the Key Management Service (KMS). By encrypting
  data at rest, sensitive information within activity logs is protected against unauthorized
  access, ensuring that only authorized personnel can decrypt and access this data.
  This security measure not only enhances the overall security posture of the cloud
  environment but also aids in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements. Implementing such encryption safeguards sensitive information and
  supports business continuity by preventing data leaks and unauthorized data manipulation.
