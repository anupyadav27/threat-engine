title: Enabling IBM COS Data Events Read in Activity Tracker
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) data events are readable in
  the Activity Tracker is crucial for maintaining comprehensive audit trails and detecting
  unauthorized access attempts. This monitoring capability helps organizations meet
  compliance requirements and enhances their overall data protection strategy by enabling
  timely response to potential security incidents.
description: This rule checks whether the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is configured
  to read data events from Cloud Object Storage (COS). By enabling this feature, organizations
  can capture and review access logs for COS, providing visibility into who accessed
  what data and when. This capability not only supports compliance with regulations
  like GDPR and HIPAA by demonstrating data access controls but also strengthens the
  organization's security posture by facilitating early detection of suspicious activities.
