title: Ensure Data Encryption at Rest for IBM Activity Tracker Targets
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling data encryption at rest for IBM Activity Tracker targets is crucial
  for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive log data. This measure
  protects against unauthorized access and potential data breaches, ensuring compliance
  with industry regulations and safeguarding customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that data encryption at rest is enabled for all targets
  within the IBM Activity Tracker service. Encryption at rest secures stored data
  by converting it into a coded format, accessible only to authorized users, thereby
  enhancing data security and reducing the risk of data exposure. Adhering to this
  rule supports compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  demonstrating a commitment to best practices in data privacy and security.
