title: Ensure Multi-Region Logging of Management Events in IBM Activity Tracker
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling multi-region logging for management events in IBM Activity Tracker
  is crucial for enhancing security posture by ensuring that log data is available
  across multiple geographic locations. This redundancy safeguards against data loss
  due to regional outages and supports compliance with data sovereignty and regulatory
  requirements. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive view of management activities
  across the cloud environment, enabling better detection and response to potential
  security incidents.
description: This rule checks whether multi-region logging is enabled for management
  events within IBM Activity Tracker. By configuring multi-region logging, organizations
  can ensure that log data is replicated across multiple IBM Cloud regions, providing
  high availability and resilience. This setup not only enhances security by preventing
  data loss due to regional failures but also aids in meeting compliance standards
  that require log data to be stored in specific geographic locations. Implementing
  this rule helps maintain audit logging integrity, supports forensic analysis, and
  ensures continuous monitoring of management activities.
