title: Ensure LogDNA Archiving is Enabled for IBM Activity Tracker Events
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling LogDNA archiving for Activity Tracker events is crucial for maintaining
  a comprehensive audit trail, which helps in forensic investigations and compliance
  reporting. Without archiving, critical security events may be lost over time, potentially
  leaving security teams blind to historical activities and increasing the risk of
  undetected policy violations or breaches.
description: This rule verifies that LogDNA archiving is enabled for IBM Activity
  Tracker events. By ensuring archiving is active, organizations can retain logs beyond
  the default retention period, providing a more comprehensive dataset for audit purposes.
  This practice not only enhances security monitoring capabilities but also assists
  in meeting regulatory compliance requirements by preserving detailed records of
  system activities and access. Moreover, archived logs enable organizations to analyze
  historical data for trends and anomalies, improving overall security posture and
  incident response effectiveness.
