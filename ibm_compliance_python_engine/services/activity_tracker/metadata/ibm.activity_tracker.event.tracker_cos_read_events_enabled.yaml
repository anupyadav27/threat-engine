title: Enable COS Read Event Tracking in IBM Activity Tracker
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling COS read events in the IBM Activity Tracker is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture by providing visibility into data access patterns. This
  rule helps organizations detect unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in
  IBM Cloud Object Storage, mitigating potential data breaches. It also supports compliance
  with industry regulations by ensuring that data access is monitored and logged effectively.
description: This rule checks if the IBM Activity Tracker is configured to capture
  read events for Cloud Object Storage (COS). By enabling this feature, organizations
  can monitor who accessed their COS resources, ensuring that all data interactions
  are logged for auditing purposes. This enhances security by providing a comprehensive
  view of data access activities, allowing for timely detection of suspicious activities.
  Furthermore, it aids in meeting compliance requirements by demonstrating that appropriate
  monitoring controls are in place to protect sensitive data.
