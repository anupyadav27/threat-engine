rule_id: ibm.activity_tracker.bucket.access_logging_enabled
title: Enable Access Logging for IBM Cloud Buckets
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling access logging on IBM Cloud buckets is crucial for tracking and
  auditing access patterns and detecting unauthorized access attempts. This ensures
  that organizations can maintain a comprehensive audit trail, which is vital for
  forensic investigations and compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR
  and HIPAA.
description: This rule verifies that access logging is enabled for all IBM Cloud buckets,
  which helps in capturing detailed records of requests made to the bucket. By enabling
  access logging, organizations can monitor and review access logs to identify potential
  security incidents or misuse of data. This practice not only enhances security by
  providing visibility into bucket activities but also supports compliance by ensuring
  that access to sensitive data is tracked and auditable. Compliance with access logging
  requirements is fundamental for meeting industry standards and maintaining the integrity
  of data management practices.
