rule_id: ibm.activity_tracker.bucket.is_not_publicly_accessible
title: Ensure IBM Cloud Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Preventing public access to IBM Cloud buckets is critical to safeguarding
  sensitive data from unauthorized users. Publicly accessible buckets can lead to
  data breaches, resulting in financial losses, reputational damage, and non-compliance
  with privacy regulations. Ensuring buckets are private mitigates these risks and
  upholds data integrity.
description: This rule checks that IBM Cloud buckets used by the Activity Tracker
  service are configured to prevent public access. By ensuring buckets are not publicly
  accessible, it enhances security by limiting data exposure to only authorized users.
  This practice aligns with industry standards and compliance frameworks such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls. Implementing this rule supports
  robust identity and access management strategies, reducing the attack surface and
  protecting sensitive information.
