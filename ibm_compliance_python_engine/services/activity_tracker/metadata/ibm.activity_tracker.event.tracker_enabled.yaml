rule_id: ibm.activity_tracker.event.tracker_enabled
title: Ensure Activity Tracker Event Logging is Enabled
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the Activity Tracker in IBM Cloud is crucial for maintaining a
  comprehensive audit trail of activities within your cloud environment. This ensures
  that any unauthorized or unexpected actions are logged, aiding in forensic investigations
  and compliance with industry standards. A properly configured activity tracker not
  only enhances security monitoring but also supports governance and regulatory requirements
  by providing an immutable record of changes.
description: This rule verifies that the Activity Tracker service is enabled for logging
  events within your IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring the tracker is active, organizations
  can capture detailed logs of user activities and system events, which are essential
  for detecting anomalies, responding to security incidents, and complying with regulatory
  frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA. Enabling the tracker also supports operational
  efficiency by providing insights into user behavior and system performance, helping
  to identify potential vulnerabilities and optimize cloud resource usage.
