title: Ensure Tracker Log File Validation is Enabled for Audit Integrity
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling tracker log file validation is crucial for ensuring the integrity
  and authenticity of audit logs in IBM Cloud. This rule helps organizations detect
  unauthorized changes to log files, which could indicate malicious activity or tampering.
  By maintaining accurate logs, businesses can meet compliance requirements and facilitate
  forensic investigations, ultimately protecting their operations and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that log file validation is enabled for the IBM Cloud
  Activity Tracker service, ensuring that all event logs are protected against unauthorized
  modifications. Log file validation uses cryptographic methods to confirm the integrity
  of log data, enhancing security by detecting potential tampering. Enabling this
  feature supports compliance with regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  require accurate and reliable logging for auditing purposes. This proactive measure
  safeguards the organization's audit trail, providing confidence in the reliability
  of security monitoring and incident response activities.
