title: Ensure COS Data Events Writing is Enabled for Activity Tracker
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling COS Data Events Write in the Activity Tracker is crucial for maintaining
  an accurate and detailed audit trail of all data interactions within IBM Cloud Object
  Storage. This capability helps organizations detect unauthorized access and ensure
  compliance with data protection regulations by providing visibility into data access
  and modifications.
description: This rule checks whether the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is configured
  to log write events for Cloud Object Storage (COS) data. Enabling this feature ensures
  that all write operations, such as object creation, updates, and deletions within
  the COS, are recorded. This logging enhances security by providing comprehensive
  audit trails for forensics and compliance purposes, helping organizations meet regulatory
  requirements like GDPR and CCPA by demonstrating accountability and transparency
  in data handling.
