title: Ensure Activity Tracker Event Logging is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling tracker logging for IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is crucial for
  maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of user and system activities. This capability
  helps in detecting unauthorized access attempts and anomalous behaviors, providing
  a foundation for incident response and forensic investigations. Furthermore, it
  supports compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring that all pertinent
  activities are logged and available for audit.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for events in IBM Cloud's
  Activity Tracker. By ensuring that event logging is active, organizations can capture
  detailed records of all activities within their cloud environment. This enhances
  security by allowing continuous monitoring and alerting of suspicious activities.
  Additionally, it aids in achieving compliance with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and
  PCI DSS, which mandate rigorous logging and monitoring practices to protect sensitive
  data and ensure accountability.
