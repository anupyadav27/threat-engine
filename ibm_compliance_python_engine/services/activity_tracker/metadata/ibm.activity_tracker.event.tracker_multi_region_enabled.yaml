title: Ensure Multi-Region Enablement for Activity Tracker Events
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling multi-region tracking for activity logs is crucial for maintaining
  a robust security posture and ensuring compliance with regional data governance
  standards. It mitigates risks associated with data residency and availability, providing
  organizations with the flexibility to adhere to jurisdictional requirements and
  enhance operational resilience in the event of regional disruptions.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service is configured
  to log events across multiple regions, ensuring comprehensive security monitoring
  and governance. By enabling multi-region tracking, organizations can capture and
  analyze logs from distributed environments, improving incident response times and
  ensuring compliance with international data protection regulations. This configuration
  supports business continuity by safeguarding against data loss and ensuring that
  critical security events are monitored globally.
