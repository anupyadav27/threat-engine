title: Ensuring Access Logging is Enabled for IBM Activity Tracker Events
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling access logging for IBM Activity Tracker events is crucial for
  maintaining a robust security posture. It provides a detailed trail of user interactions
  and system changes, which is vital for forensic analysis and incident response.
  This level of visibility into system activity helps organizations detect unauthorized
  access and comply with regulatory requirements.
description: This security rule verifies that access logging is enabled for IBM Cloud
  Activity Tracker events. By ensuring logging is turned on, organizations can monitor
  and audit all access events within their cloud environment. This enhances security
  by allowing for real-time detection of suspicious activities and unauthorized access
  attempts. Additionally, maintaining comprehensive logs is essential for meeting
  compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, as it demonstrates a commitment to
  data protection and accountability.
