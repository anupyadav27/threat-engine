title: Enable Threat Detection for LLM Jacking in Activity Tracker
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling threat detection for LLM jacking is crucial because it helps identify
  and mitigate unauthorized attempts to manipulate language learning models (LLMs),
  which can lead to data breaches or compromised system integrity. This proactive
  measure protects sensitive data and upholds trust in AI-driven processes, ensuring
  continuity in business operations and compliance with regulatory standards.
description: This rule ensures that threat detection capabilities are activated for
  LLM jacking within IBM Cloud's Activity Tracker service. By monitoring and logging
  events related to LLM manipulation, this rule enhances the security posture by providing
  visibility into potential threats and enabling quick response. It supports compliance
  by maintaining a robust audit trail, assisting organizations in meeting governance
  and regulatory requirements for data protection and threat monitoring.
