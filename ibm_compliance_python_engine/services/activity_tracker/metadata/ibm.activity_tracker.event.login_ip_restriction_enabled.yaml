rule_id: ibm.activity_tracker.event.login_ip_restriction_enabled
title: Ensure Login IP Restriction is Enabled in IBM Cloud Activity Tracker
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling login IP restrictions in IBM Cloud's Activity Tracker is crucial
  for safeguarding access to sensitive logging and monitoring data. By restricting
  logins to specific IP addresses, organizations can prevent unauthorized access attempts,
  thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring that only trusted IPs are
  permitted. This practice also aligns with compliance requirements by demonstrating
  proactive measures to protect sensitive information.
description: This rule checks if login IP restrictions are enabled for the IBM Cloud
  Activity Tracker service, ensuring that only specified IP addresses can access the
  logging data. By implementing IP restrictions, organizations can control and monitor
  access, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.
  This security measure enhances the overall security posture and aids in meeting
  regulatory compliance standards by demonstrating control over access to critical
  logging information. Enforcing IP restrictions helps maintain the integrity and
  confidentiality of audit logs, which are vital for forensic investigations and compliance
  auditing.
