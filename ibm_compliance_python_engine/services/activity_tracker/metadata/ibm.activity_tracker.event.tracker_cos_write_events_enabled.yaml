title: Enable COS Write Event Tracking in IBM Activity Tracker
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling the tracking of COS write events is crucial for maintaining security
  and compliance within your cloud environment. By monitoring these events, organizations
  can detect unauthorized access or changes to critical data, helping to prevent data
  breaches and ensure accountability. This practice supports compliance with data
  protection regulations and strengthens the overall security posture.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is configured to
  log write events for Cloud Object Storage (COS). By ensuring that COS write events
  are tracked, organizations can monitor and audit access to their storage resources
  effectively. This capability enhances incident response times and provides comprehensive
  visibility into data access patterns, thereby supporting compliance with industry
  standards and regulatory requirements. Additionally, it aids in forensic analysis
  and investigatory processes in the event of a security incident.
