title: Ensure Threat Detection for Privilege Escalation is Enabled in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enabling threat detection for privilege escalation is crucial as it helps
  identify unauthorized attempts to elevate user privileges, which is a common vector
  for security breaches. This proactive measure protects sensitive data and maintains
  the integrity of cloud resources by ensuring that only authorized users have access
  to critical functions, thereby minimizing the risk of internal and external threats.
description: This security rule ensures that the Activity Tracker service in IBM Cloud
  is configured to detect and alert on privilege escalation events. It checks if the
  necessary threat detection settings are enabled, which are vital for monitoring
  unauthorized access attempts that could lead to data breaches. By implementing this
  rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by adhering to the principle
  of least privilege, ensuring compliance with security frameworks, and responding
  promptly to potential threats, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.
