rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.encrypted_at_rest
title: Enforce Encryption for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting object storage buckets at rest is crucial for protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. By ensuring that data is encrypted,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with data exposure and comply with industry
  standards and regulations, safeguarding both business interests and customer trust.
description: This rule checks that all IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets have encryption
  enabled at rest, ensuring that any data stored is automatically encrypted using
  robust algorithms. This practice enhances data security by safeguarding data from
  unauthorized access, even if physical storage devices are compromised. Enforcing
  encryption at rest also aids organizations in meeting compliance requirements such
  as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate stringent data protection measures. By
  adhering to this rule, organizations can maintain a strong security posture and
  demonstrate their commitment to data privacy and protection.
