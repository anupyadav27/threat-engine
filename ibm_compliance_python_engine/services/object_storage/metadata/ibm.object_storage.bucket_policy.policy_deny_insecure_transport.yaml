rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket_policy.policy_deny_insecure_transport
title: Enforce Secure Transport for IBM Cloud Object Storage Access
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Ensuring data is transmitted securely over the network is crucial to protect
  sensitive information from interception and unauthorized access. By denying insecure
  transport, organizations can mitigate risks associated with data breaches and maintain
  the confidentiality and integrity of their data. This practice also helps in aligning
  with industry regulations and standards that mandate secure data transmission.
description: This rule checks that all IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket policies enforce
  secure transport protocols by denying any requests that do not use HTTPS. By implementing
  this policy, organizations prevent data from being exposed to potential interception
  when transmitted over unsecured channels. Ensuring secure transport not only enhances
  data protection but also supports compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which require secure data handling practices.
