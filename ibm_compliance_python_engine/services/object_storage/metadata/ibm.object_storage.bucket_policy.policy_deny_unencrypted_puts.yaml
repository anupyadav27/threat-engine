rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket_policy.policy_deny_unencrypted_puts
title: Enforce Encryption for Object Storage Bucket Policies
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing encryption for PUT operations in IBM Cloud Object Storage ensures
  that data is protected from unauthorized access and potential breaches during transit
  and at rest. This requirement mitigates the risk of data exposure, thereby safeguarding
  sensitive information and maintaining customer trust and compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This rule checks that bucket policies in IBM Cloud Object Storage are
  configured to deny PUT requests for objects that are not encrypted. By ensuring
  that all data written to the buckets is encrypted, organizations can enhance their
  data protection measures, preventing unencrypted data from being stored and accessed.
  This practice aligns with industry standards for data security and compliance, such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, providing a robust security posture against data leaks and unauthorized
  access.
