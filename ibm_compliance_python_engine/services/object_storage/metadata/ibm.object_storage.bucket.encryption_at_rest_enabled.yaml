title: Ensure Encryption at Rest for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and breaches. It ensures
  that any stored information remains secure even if physical storage media are compromised,
  thus maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, which is vital for preserving
  customer trust and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks if encryption at rest is enabled for IBM Cloud Object
  Storage buckets, ensuring that data is automatically encrypted before being written
  to disk and decrypted when accessed by authorized users. By enforcing encryption,
  it provides an additional layer of security that protects stored data from unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. Implementing encryption at rest is a key compliance
  measure for regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate the protection of
  sensitive data through encryption.
