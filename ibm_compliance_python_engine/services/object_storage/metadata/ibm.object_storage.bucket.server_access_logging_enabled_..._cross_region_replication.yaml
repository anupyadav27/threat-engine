title: Enable Server Access Logging and Cross-Region Replication for Buckets
severity: medium
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling server access logging and cross-region replication for IBM Cloud
  Object Storage buckets is critical for enhancing data security and ensuring compliance.
  Server access logging provides visibility into bucket operations, which is essential
  for detecting unauthorized access and understanding data usage patterns. Cross-region
  replication ensures data availability and durability, mitigating risks associated
  with data loss or corruption in a single region.
description: This rule checks if server access logging is enabled on IBM Cloud Object
  Storage buckets and if the data is replicated across regions. By enabling server
  access logging, organizations can monitor and audit access requests, helping to
  identify and respond to security incidents promptly. Cross-region replication ensures
  that data is consistently backed up in multiple geographic locations, providing
  resilience against regional outages or failures. This setup not only strengthens
  the security posture but also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data protection
  and availability.
