rule_id: ibm.object_storage.notification_configuration.notification_destination_encrypted
title: Ensure Encryption of Notification Destinations in IBM Object Storage
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing encryption for notification destinations is crucial to protect
  sensitive data in transit from unauthorized access and potential interception. Failing
  to encrypt these communications can lead to data breaches, compromising user privacy
  and violating compliance requirements, potentially resulting in financial and reputational
  damage to the organization.
description: This rule checks whether the destinations configured for object storage
  notifications are encrypted, ensuring that data sent to notification endpoints is
  protected. By mandating encryption, the security and confidentiality of the data
  are maintained, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure. This practice aligns
  with industry standards and compliance frameworks that require encryption of sensitive
  data, thus aiding organizations in meeting regulatory obligations such as GDPR and
  HIPAA.
