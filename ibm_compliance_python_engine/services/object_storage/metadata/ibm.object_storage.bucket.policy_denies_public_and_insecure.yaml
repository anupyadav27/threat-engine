rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.policy_denies_public_and_insecure
title: Enforce Secure and Private Access to IBM Object Storage Buckets
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that object storage buckets deny public and insecure access is
  crucial for safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  By enforcing strict access policies, organizations can prevent data leaks and maintain
  compliance with regulatory standards, thereby protecting their brand reputation
  and avoiding costly penalties.
description: This rule checks that object storage buckets are configured to deny public
  and insecure access, which prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive
  data. It enforces policies that only allow access through secure, authenticated
  channels, significantly reducing the risk of data exposure. By implementing this
  control, organizations enhance their security posture and align with best practices
  for data protection and regulatory compliance, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
