rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.versioning_enabled
title: Ensure Versioning is Enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling versioning on Object Storage buckets is crucial for data durability
  and recovery. It allows organizations to retain previous versions of objects, protecting
  against accidental deletions or overwrites and ensuring that data can be restored
  to a prior state. This capability is vital for maintaining data integrity and supporting
  compliance with regulations that mandate data retention and protection.
description: This security rule verifies that versioning is enabled for IBM Cloud
  Object Storage buckets, a critical measure for safeguarding data. By maintaining
  previous versions of objects, organizations can recover from unintended modifications
  or deletions, thereby enhancing data resilience and security posture. The practice
  of enabling versioning addresses both operational risks and compliance requirements,
  as it supports audit capabilities and demonstrates adherence to data protection
  standards.
