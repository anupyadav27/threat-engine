rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket_policy.policy_no_wildcards
title: Ensure No Wildcards in IBM Cloud Object Storage Bucket Policies
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Utilizing wildcards in bucket policies can inadvertently grant excessive
  permissions, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access. This could
  lead to data breaches and compliance violations, compromising the integrity and
  confidentiality of the data stored. By restricting the use of wildcards, organizations
  can enforce more granular access controls, aligning with best practices for secure
  data management.
description: This rule checks for the presence of wildcard characters in IBM Cloud
  Object Storage bucket policies, specifically in the principal or resource fields.
  Removing wildcards ensures that access permissions are explicit and narrowly defined,
  thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized data access. Implementing this rule enhances
  security posture by promoting precise access control policies and supports compliance
  with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict data access
  management.
