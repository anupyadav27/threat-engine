rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.block_public_access_enabled
title: Ensure Object Storage Buckets Have Block Public Access Enabled
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling block public access on IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets is crucial
  to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible
  buckets can expose sensitive data to the internet, leading to data leaks and non-compliance
  with data protection regulations, which can have severe financial and reputational
  repercussions for businesses.
description: This rule verifies that all IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets have public
  access blocked, ensuring that no data within the buckets is inadvertently exposed
  to the public internet. By enforcing this control, organizations can significantly
  reduce the risk of unauthorized data access and maintain compliance with industry
  standards and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Blocking public access enhances
  the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can
  access the stored data, thus safeguarding sensitive information.
