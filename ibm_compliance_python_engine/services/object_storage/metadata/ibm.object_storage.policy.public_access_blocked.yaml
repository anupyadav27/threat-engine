rule_id: ibm.object_storage.policy.public_access_blocked
title: Enforce Private Access to Object Storage by Blocking Public Policies
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Blocking public access to object storage policies is crucial to protect
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring
  policies do not allow public access, organizations mitigate the risks of exposing
  confidential information, thus preserving data integrity and compliance with industry
  regulations.
description: This rule checks object storage policies to verify that public access
  is blocked, ensuring only authorized users can interact with stored data. By enforcing
  this rule, the security posture of object storage is significantly enhanced, as
  it prevents unintended data exposure to the public. Implementing this control supports
  compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, as it restricts
  access to sensitive information and ensures appropriate authentication measures
  are in place.
