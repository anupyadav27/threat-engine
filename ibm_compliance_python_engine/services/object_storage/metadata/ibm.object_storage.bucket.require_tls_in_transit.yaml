rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.require_tls_in_transit
title: Enforce TLS for Secure Data Transmission in Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Ensuring that TLS is used for data in transit to and from object storage
  buckets is critical to protecting sensitive information from interception and tampering.
  This security measure prevents unauthorized access and potential data breaches,
  thereby safeguarding organizational assets and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule mandates the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all
  data transferred to and from object storage buckets. It checks that TLS protocols
  are enforced to encrypt data in transit, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
  By implementing this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture and
  comply with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require robust data
  protection mechanisms.
