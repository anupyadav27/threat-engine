title: Ensure Lifecycle Policies are Enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling lifecycle policies for IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets is crucial
  for automating data management tasks, such as transitioning data to different storage
  classes or deleting outdated objects. This practice not only optimizes storage costs
  by removing obsolete data but also enhances data security by reducing the risk of
  exposure from unnecessary data retention.
description: This rule checks whether lifecycle management is enabled for IBM Cloud
  Object Storage buckets. Lifecycle policies allow for the automatic transition of
  objects to more cost-effective storage classes or their deletion after a specified
  period. By implementing lifecycle policies, organizations can ensure that data is
  retained only as long as necessary, reducing the attack surface and aligning with
  data governance and compliance requirements. Proper lifecycle management is a proactive
  measure to enforce data lifecycle policies and mitigate risks related to data over-retention.
