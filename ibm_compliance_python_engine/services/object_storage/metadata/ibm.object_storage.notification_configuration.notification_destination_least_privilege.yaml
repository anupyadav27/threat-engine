title: Enforce Least Privilege for Object Storage Notification Destinations
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that notification destinations in IBM Cloud Object Storage adhere
  to the principle of least privilege is crucial for minimizing security risks. By
  restricting access permissions to only what is essential, organizations can protect
  sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access, thereby reducing potential data
  breaches and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule verifies that notification configurations within IBM Cloud
  Object Storage are set up with the least privilege principle in mind. It checks
  that only necessary permissions are granted for notification destinations, ensuring
  that no excess access rights are available that could be exploited by malicious
  actors. By enforcing this rule, organizations bolster their security posture, protect
  sensitive information, and align with compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA,
  which mandate strict access controls.
