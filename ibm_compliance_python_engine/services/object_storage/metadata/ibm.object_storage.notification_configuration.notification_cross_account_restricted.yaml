title: Restrict Cross-Account Notifications in IBM Object Storage
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Limiting cross-account notification access in IBM Object Storage is essential
  to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data by ensuring that only authorized
  accounts can receive sensitive notifications. This restriction mitigates the risk
  of data leaks and unauthorized data access, thus protecting business-critical information
  and adhering to compliance requirements.
description: This security rule checks for configurations in IBM Object Storage that
  permit notifications to be sent to accounts outside the trusted boundary. By restricting
  cross-account notifications, organizations can prevent accidental or malicious exposure
  of sensitive data to unauthorized entities. Implementing this rule enhances data
  security by ensuring that notifications about storage events are only accessible
  to vetted and trusted accounts, aligning with best practices for cloud security
  and regulatory compliance frameworks.
