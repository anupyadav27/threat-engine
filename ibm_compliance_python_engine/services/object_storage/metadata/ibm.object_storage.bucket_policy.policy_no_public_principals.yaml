rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket_policy.policy_no_public_principals
title: Enforce No Public Access in IBM Object Storage Bucket Policies
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that IBM Object Storage buckets do not have policies granting
  public access is crucial to prevent unauthorized data exposure and potential data
  breaches. Public access can lead to sensitive information being inadvertently shared
  with malicious actors, posing significant risks to business operations and compliance
  with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that the bucket policies for IBM Object Storage do
  not include public principals, which would allow unrestricted access to the data
  stored within. By enforcing policies that exclude public access, organizations can
  maintain tighter control over who can view and modify stored data, thereby enhancing
  data confidentiality and integrity. This practice aligns with best practices for
  access management and helps in maintaining compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict access controls.
