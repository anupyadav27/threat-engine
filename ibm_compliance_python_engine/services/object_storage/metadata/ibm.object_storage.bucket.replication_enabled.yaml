rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.replication_enabled
title: Ensure Replication Enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling replication for IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets is crucial for
  ensuring data availability and resilience. It mitigates the risk of data loss in
  the event of a failure in one region, providing business continuity by automatically
  copying data to a secondary location. This not only strengthens disaster recovery
  capabilities but also supports compliance with data protection regulations that
  require data redundancy.
description: This rule checks that replication is enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage
  buckets, ensuring that data stored in one region is automatically replicated to
  another. By enabling replication, organizations can bolster their data redundancy
  strategy, providing a safeguard against potential data loss due to regional outages
  or disasters. Furthermore, enabling replication aids in meeting compliance requirements
  related to data protection and continuity, such as those mandated by regulatory
  frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA. This practice enhances the overall security posture
  by ensuring critical data is always available and protected.
