rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.not_publicly_readable
title: Ensure IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets Are Not Publicly Readable
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Publicly readable storage buckets in IBM Cloud can expose sensitive data
  to unauthorized users, leading to potential data breaches and non-compliance with
  regulatory standards. Ensuring buckets are not publicly readable mitigates the risk
  of data exfiltration and protects organizational assets and customer information.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets are configured
  to prevent public read access, which is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality
  and integrity. By disallowing public readability, organizations can enforce strict
  access controls, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access
  the stored data. This practice not only enhances security by reducing the attack
  surface but also aids in compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, which require safeguarding personal and sensitive information against
  unauthorized access.
