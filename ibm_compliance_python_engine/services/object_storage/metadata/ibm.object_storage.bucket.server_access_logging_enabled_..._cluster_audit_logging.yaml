rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.server_access_logging_enabled_..._cluster_audit_logging
title: Ensure Server Access Logging is Enabled for Object Storage Buckets
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling server access logging for object storage buckets is crucial for
  maintaining visibility into access patterns and potential unauthorized access attempts.
  This practice supports incident response efforts and aids in forensic investigations
  by providing detailed access logs, which are essential for maintaining data security
  and integrity.
description: This rule ensures that server access logging is enabled for object storage
  buckets within the IBM Cloud environment. By enabling this feature, organizations
  can track requests made to their storage buckets, capturing data such as request
  type, requester, and time of access. This not only enhances security by providing
  insights into user activities but also facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements
  that mandate logging and monitoring of data access. Implementing server access logging
  aligns with best practices for audit logging and monitoring, thereby improving the
  overall security posture.
