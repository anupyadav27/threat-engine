title: Enforce Log Retention Policy Lock on IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Implementing a log retention policy lock is crucial for ensuring the integrity
  and availability of audit logs within your organization. By enforcing this policy,
  you prevent accidental or unauthorized modification or deletion of log data, which
  is essential for forensic investigations and compliance reporting. This practice
  supports adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards, thereby reducing
  the risk of data breaches and non-compliance penalties.
description: This security rule verifies that IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets have
  a log retention policy lock in place. The log retention policy lock ensures that
  audit logs generated by the bucket are retained for a specified period, preventing
  premature deletion or alteration. By establishing this control, organizations can
  maintain a comprehensive audit trail, which is vital for monitoring access and changes,
  supporting incident response, and meeting compliance obligations such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and PCI DSS. The implementation of a log retention policy lock enhances the security
  posture by safeguarding critical log data and ensuring its availability for audit
  and compliance purposes.
