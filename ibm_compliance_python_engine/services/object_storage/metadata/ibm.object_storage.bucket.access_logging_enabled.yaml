rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.access_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Access Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling access logging on IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets is crucial
  for auditing and monitoring activities. It provides visibility into operations performed
  on the buckets, helping identify unauthorized access or anomalous behavior. This
  practice supports compliance with security standards by maintaining detailed records
  of access events, which is essential for forensic investigations and accountability.
description: This rule checks whether access logging is enabled for IBM Cloud Object
  Storage buckets. Access logging records all requests made to a bucket, including
  details such as the request type, requester information, and the time of the request.
  By enabling logging, organizations can track and analyze access patterns, detect
  potential security threats, and comply with regulatory requirements like GDPR or
  HIPAA. This proactive monitoring capability strengthens the security posture by
  facilitating timely detection and response to irregular activities.
