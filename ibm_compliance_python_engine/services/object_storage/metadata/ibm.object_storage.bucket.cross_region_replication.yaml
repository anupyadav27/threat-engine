title: Enforce Cross Region Replication for Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Cross Region Replication (CRR) for object storage buckets is crucial for
  maintaining data availability and durability in the face of regional outages or
  disasters. By enabling CRR, businesses can ensure that their critical data remains
  accessible and intact, thereby minimizing potential disruptions and maintaining
  compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This security rule checks if Cross Region Replication is enabled for
  object storage buckets, ensuring data is consistently replicated across different
  geographical regions within IBM Cloud. This practice enhances data redundancy and
  resilience, protecting against data loss due to regional failures. Enabling CRR
  not only bolsters security posture by safeguarding data integrity but also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements related to data residency and disaster recovery
  strategies.
