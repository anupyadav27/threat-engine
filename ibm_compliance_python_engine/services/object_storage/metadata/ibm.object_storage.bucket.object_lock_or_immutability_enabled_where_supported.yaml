rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.object_lock_or_immutability_enabled_where_supported
title: Enable Object Lock or Immutability for IBM Cloud Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling Object Lock or immutability for object storage buckets is essential
  to protect data from accidental deletion or malicious tampering. This security control
  ensures data integrity and compliance with regulatory standards by maintaining a
  non-editable and non-deletable state for critical data, thereby safeguarding business
  continuity and reducing legal risks.
description: This rule checks whether Object Lock or immutability is enabled for IBM
  Cloud Object Storage buckets where supported. By enabling these features, stored
  objects become immutable for a specified period, ensuring they cannot be altered
  or deleted until the lock expires. This measure enhances the security posture by
  preventing unauthorized changes, supporting compliance with data protection regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, and providing an additional layer of data protection against
  ransomware and operational errors.
