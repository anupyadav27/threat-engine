rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.metrics_enabled
title: Ensure Metrics are Enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling metrics on IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets provides visibility
  into bucket access patterns and data transfer, which is essential for security monitoring
  and performance optimization. Metrics help in identifying unauthorized access attempts
  and support compliance with data governance policies by providing detailed access
  logs.
description: This rule checks whether metrics are enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage
  buckets, ensuring that detailed usage statistics are collected. By enabling metrics,
  organizations gain insights into data access activities, helping to detect anomalies
  and unauthorized access. This practice supports compliance with industry regulations
  by maintaining an audit trail of data interactions and contributes to proactive
  security posture management by enabling continuous monitoring.
