rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.accounts
title: Ensure Encryption for IBM Cloud Object Storage Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Encrypting IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets is essential to protect sensitive
  data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. Without encryption, data stored
  in the cloud can be vulnerable to interception during transmission or unauthorized
  access at rest, leading to compliance violations and financial repercussions.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for IBM Cloud Object Storage
  buckets, ensuring data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. By enforcing encryption,
  organizations enhance their data protection posture, aligning with industry best
  practices and regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. Enabling encryption
  contributes to the confidentiality and integrity of data, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.
