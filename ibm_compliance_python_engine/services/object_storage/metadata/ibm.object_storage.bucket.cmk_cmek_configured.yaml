rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.cmk_cmek_configured
title: Ensure CMK for Object Storage Bucket Encryption is Configured
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Configuring a Customer-Managed Key (CMK) for object storage buckets ensures
  that sensitive data is encrypted with keys managed by the organization, providing
  greater control over encryption key lifecycle management and access policies. This
  measure mitigates risks associated with unauthorized data access and enhances trust
  by adhering to stringent data protection standards.
description: This rule verifies that object storage buckets within IBM Cloud have
  a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMK) configured, ensuring that data-at-rest is
  encrypted using keys under the control of the customer. By leveraging CMK, organizations
  can enforce encryption policies that align with their security and compliance requirements.
  This enhances data protection by allowing customers to rotate, disable, or revoke
  access to encryption keys as needed, thereby strengthening security posture and
  ensuring compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
