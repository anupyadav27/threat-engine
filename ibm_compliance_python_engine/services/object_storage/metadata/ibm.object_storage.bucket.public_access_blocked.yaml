rule_id: ibm.object_storage.bucket.public_access_blocked
title: Ensure Public Access to Object Storage Buckets is Blocked
severity: critical
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Blocking public access to object storage buckets is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized data exposure and potential data breaches. Publicly accessible buckets
  can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to the compromise of sensitive data
  and significant financial and reputational damage to the organization.
description: This rule verifies that object storage buckets within IBM Cloud have
  public access blocked, ensuring data is not inadvertently exposed to the internet.
  By enforcing access controls, this rule enhances the security posture of the storage
  resources, protects sensitive data, and helps maintain compliance with data protection
  regulations. This proactive measure is vital for safeguarding data integrity and
  confidentiality in cloud environments.
