title: Ensure Lifecycle Management for Cross-Region Replication in IBM VPC Buckets
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enabling lifecycle management for IBM VPC cross-region replication is crucial
  for maintaining data redundancy and availability across different geographical locations.
  This practice enhances data durability and aids in disaster recovery strategies
  by ensuring that data is consistently replicated and managed across regions, minimizing
  the risk of data loss due to regional failures.
description: This rule verifies that lifecycle management is enabled for IBM VPC object
  storage buckets configured for cross-region replication. Lifecycle management helps
  automate the transition of data between different storage classes and the expiration
  of objects, optimizing storage costs and ensuring compliance with data retention
  policies. By enabling this feature, organizations can maintain a streamlined and
  efficient data management process, ensuring that replicated data is stored securely
  and complies with regulatory requirements for data protection and retention.
