title: Enforce Bounded Rate Limiting for API Stage Throttle Overrides
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing bounded rate limits for API stage throttle overrides is crucial
  to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of services. Unbounded rate limits can
  lead to excessive resource consumption, potentially resulting in service outages
  and degraded performance, which can have a direct impact on user experience and
  operational costs.
description: This rule ensures that rate limiting for API stage throttle overrides
  is set within defined boundaries to prevent unintentional or malicious overload
  of system resources. By checking that throttle overrides are not unbounded, the
  rule helps maintain consistent service performance and availability. Enforcing bounded
  rate limits aligns with best practices in security and compliance by mitigating
  the risk of denial-of-service attacks and ensuring adherence to service-level agreements
  (SLAs) through controlled resource allocation.
