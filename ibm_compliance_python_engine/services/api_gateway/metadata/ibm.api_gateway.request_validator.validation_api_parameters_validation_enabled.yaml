rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.request_validator.validation_api_parameters_validation_enabled
title: Ensure API Gateway Request Parameter Validation is Enabled
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling validation of API parameters in the API Gateway is crucial for
  maintaining data integrity and preventing malicious data input. By ensuring that
  only correctly formatted and expected parameters are processed, businesses can mitigate
  risks associated with injection attacks and data breaches, thereby protecting sensitive
  information and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks whether the request validator in the API Gateway has
  the validation of API parameters enabled. When this validation is active, the API
  Gateway inspects incoming requests to ensure that they comply with defined parameter
  formats and constraints. This process helps in identifying and blocking potentially
  harmful requests before they reach backend services. Enforcing parameter validation
  strengthens security posture by adhering to best practices in input validation and
  supports compliance with regulatory standards that require robust data protection
  mechanisms.
