title: Enforce Least Privilege on IBM Cloud API Gateway Key Scopes
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that API keys operate under the principle of least privilege is
  crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. By restricting
  API key permissions to only what is necessary, organizations can prevent potential
  exploitation of excessive privileges, thereby protecting sensitive data and ensuring
  compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule evaluates the API keys within the IBM Cloud API Gateway to
  ensure they are assigned the minimum necessary permissions required for their function.
  By enforcing least privilege, the rule helps to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
  access and privilege escalation attacks. Implementing this rule not only strengthens
  the security posture of the cloud environment but also aids in maintaining compliance
  with regulatory requirements by ensuring that access controls are appropriately
  enforced.
