title: Enforce API Request Body Size Limits for Improved Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring a size limit for API request bodies is crucial to prevent potential
  denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where excessively large payloads can overwhelm the
  system. By enforcing these limits, organizations can maintain service availability
  and protect backend systems from performance degradation, ensuring compliance with
  best practices in API management.
description: This rule checks whether a size limit is configured for the request body
  in API Gateway's request validator. By setting a maximum request body size, the
  system can reject requests that exceed this threshold, thereby mitigating the risk
  of resource exhaustion and ensuring smoother operation under heavy loads. Implementing
  this control aligns with compliance standards that mandate protective measures against
  DoS attacks and aid in maintaining a robust security posture by preventing abuse
  of API endpoints.
