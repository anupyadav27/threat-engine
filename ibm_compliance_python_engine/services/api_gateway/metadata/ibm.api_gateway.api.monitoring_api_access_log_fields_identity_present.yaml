rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.api.monitoring_api_access_log_fields_identity_present
title: Ensure API Gateway Access Logs Include Identity Fields
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Including identity fields in API access logs is crucial for traceability
  and accountability. It enables security teams to correlate API activity with specific
  users, which aids in detecting unauthorized access attempts, enforcing compliance,
  and conducting thorough forensic investigations when security incidents occur. This
  practice helps mitigate potential breaches by providing detailed insights into user
  activity.
description: This rule verifies that identity fields are present in the API Gateway
  access logs, ensuring that each API request is associated with a user or service
  account identity. By capturing this information, organizations can enhance their
  security posture by maintaining a clear audit trail of who accessed what, when,
  and how. This not only supports internal security policies but also aligns with
  compliance requirements such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, which mandate detailed logging
  and monitoring of access to sensitive information.
