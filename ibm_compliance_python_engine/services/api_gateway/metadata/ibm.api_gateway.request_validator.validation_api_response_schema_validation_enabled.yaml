rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.request_validator.validation_api_response_schema_validation_enabled
title: Ensure API Response Schema Validation is Enabled for Security Compliance
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling validation of API response schemas is crucial for preventing data
  leaks and ensuring data integrity. It helps safeguard against unintended data exposure
  by ensuring that the responses adhere strictly to defined schemas, thus protecting
  sensitive information and maintaining trust with users and stakeholders.
description: This rule checks if the API Gateway's request validator has the response
  schema validation feature enabled, a critical component for enforcing data structure
  integrity. By validating response schemas, it ensures that all outgoing data aligns
  with pre-defined specifications, reducing the risk of data breaches through malformed
  or unintended data structures. This practice not only enhances security but also
  aids in meeting compliance requirements and governance policies by maintaining strict
  data handling protocols.
