title: Enforce Authorization Policies on IBM Cloud API Gateway Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that platform endpoint authorization policies are enforced is
  crucial for maintaining secure access to APIs. This practice helps in mitigating
  unauthorized access risks, thereby protecting sensitive data and ensuring that only
  authorized users and services can interact with the API. By enforcing these policies,
  businesses can prevent data breaches and maintain trust with their customers and
  partners.
description: This rule checks whether authorization policies are enforced on platform
  endpoints within the IBM Cloud API Gateway. By requiring strict authorization checks,
  this rule helps ensure that all API requests are authenticated and authorized before
  granting access. This enhances the security posture by reducing the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data leaks. Additionally, enforcing these policies supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, such as GDPR and
  PCI DSS, by ensuring that access to APIs is properly controlled and monitored.
