rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.api.monitoring_api_access_logging_enabled
title: Ensure API Gateway Access Logging is Enabled for Monitoring
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling access logging for API Gateway is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive
  audit trail of API usage, which aids in identifying unauthorized access attempts,
  misuse, or anomalous activities. This practice enhances the organization's ability
  to respond to security incidents and supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  by providing a detailed record of user interactions with APIs.
description: This security rule verifies that access logging is enabled for APIs managed
  via IBM API Gateway. By ensuring logging is active, organizations can capture and
  analyze API requests and responses, facilitating the detection of suspicious activities
  and potential breaches. This logging capability not only strengthens security by
  providing visibility into API operations but also supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulations by maintaining detailed access records. Properly configured
  logging helps in forensic investigations and incident response, thereby improving
  the overall security posture of the cloud environment.
