title: Ensure Rate Limits Configured for API Gateway Usage Plans
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring rate limits for API Gateway usage plans is crucial to prevent
  resource exhaustion and ensure fair access among consumers. By implementing rate
  limits, organizations can protect backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive
  requests, which enhances system availability and reliability. This also helps in
  controlling costs by preventing unintended usage spikes.
description: This rule checks whether rate limits are configured for platform usage
  plans within IBM Cloud's API Gateway service. By enforcing rate limits, the rule
  ensures that each client or consumer is restricted to a predefined number of API
  requests in a given period. This configuration is vital for mitigating denial-of-service
  (DoS) attacks and ensuring service-level agreements (SLAs) are met by distributing
  available resources effectively. Additionally, having rate limits in place aligns
  with compliance requirements that demand effective monitoring and control of system
  resources.
