title: Enforce Whitelist Validation for API Content Types in IBM Cloud
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing a whitelist for API content types is crucial for maintaining
  data integrity and preventing malicious payloads from compromising API security.
  By restricting allowed content types, organizations can mitigate risks associated
  with data breaches and unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with industry standards
  and protecting sensitive information.
description: This rule ensures that the API Gateway enforces a whitelist for content
  types in API requests, validating that only predefined and approved content types
  are accepted. By implementing this validation, the rule helps prevent injection
  attacks and reduces the attack surface by limiting the types of data that can be
  processed by APIs. This measure not only enhances the security posture of the API
  Gateway but also aids in maintaining compliance with data protection regulations
  and industry best practices, thereby supporting governance and risk management strategies.
