title: Enforce Usage Plans for API Gateway Keys at Platform Stage
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing usage plans for API keys in the IBM Cloud API Gateway ensures
  that API usage is controlled and monitored, mitigating the risk of unauthorized
  access and potential data breaches. This practice is essential for maintaining data
  integrity and privacy, as it helps in tracking and limiting API consumption, which
  is crucial for compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks if usage plans are applied to API keys in the deployment
  phase within the IBM Cloud API Gateway. Usage plans define specific limits and quotas
  for API calls, thus providing a mechanism to manage and restrict access to APIs
  based on predefined criteria. By enforcing usage plans, organizations can ensure
  that API keys are not misused, data is protected, and services are not overwhelmed
  by excessive or malicious requests. This rule supports adherence to best practices
  in data protection and privacy by ensuring that all API interactions are subject
  to rigorous access controls.
