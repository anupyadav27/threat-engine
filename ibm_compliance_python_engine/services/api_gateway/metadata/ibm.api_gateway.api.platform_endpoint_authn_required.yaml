rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.api.platform_endpoint_authn_required
title: Enforce Authentication for API Platform Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Requiring authentication for API platform endpoints ensures that only authorized
  users and applications can access your API services. This rule minimizes the risk
  of unauthorized data exposure and potential misuse of API resources, thereby maintaining
  the integrity and confidentiality of your business operations.
description: This rule checks if authentication mechanisms are enforced for all API
  platform endpoints within the IBM Cloud API Gateway service. By requiring authentication,
  organizations can restrict access to their APIs, ensuring that only authenticated
  users or systems can interact with them. This practice is a fundamental security
  measure that helps protect sensitive data and operations from unauthorized access.
  Moreover, implementing authentication aligns with compliance frameworks that mandate
  access control measures, thereby assisting organizations in meeting regulatory requirements.
