rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.api.monitoring_api_access_log_sink_configured
title: Ensure API Gateway Access Log Sink is Configured for Monitoring
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring monitoring for API access logs is crucial for detecting unauthorized
  access attempts and understanding user interactions with the API. Without proper
  logging, it becomes challenging to identify potential security threats or compliance
  violations, which could lead to data breaches and regulatory penalties.
description: This rule verifies that an access log sink is configured in the IBM Cloud
  API Gateway to capture API request and response data. By ensuring logs are recorded
  and stored in a secure and centralized location, organizations can enhance their
  ability to monitor and audit API usage effectively. This practice supports compliance
  with industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and PCI DSS, by providing
  a traceable record of API interactions and aiding in incident response and forensic
  investigations.
