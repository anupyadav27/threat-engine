title: Enforce TLS 1.2 for Secure API Gateway Authorizer Communications
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing a minimum of TLS 1.2 for API Gateway authorizers is crucial for
  maintaining data integrity and confidentiality during transmission. This rule helps
  protect sensitive data against interception and unauthorized access, ensuring compliance
  with industry standards and reducing the risk of data breaches.
description: This rule verifies that the API Gateway authorizer enforces TLS version
  1.2 or higher for secure communications. By ensuring that older, less secure versions
  of TLS are not used, this rule mitigates the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and
  eavesdropping. It aligns with best practices for encryption at rest and supports
  compliance with regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that
  transmitted data is protected with robust encryption protocols.
