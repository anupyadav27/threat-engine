title: Ensure Minimum Error Level for API Execution Logging in IBM API Gateway
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Maintaining a minimum logging level of 'Error' for API execution is crucial
  for promptly identifying and troubleshooting issues. This practice is essential
  for detecting anomalies and unauthorized activities, thus safeguarding the integrity
  and availability of APIs. Failure to adequately log errors can lead to undetected
  breaches and operational inefficiencies, impacting business continuity and compliance
  obligations.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM API Gateway is configured to log at a
  minimum level of 'Error' for all API executions. By ensuring this logging level,
  organizations can capture critical error events that provide insights into potential
  security incidents and system failures. This logging practice enhances security
  by facilitating timely detection and response to errors and anomalies, while also
  supporting compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate thorough
  audit trails and monitoring mechanisms.
