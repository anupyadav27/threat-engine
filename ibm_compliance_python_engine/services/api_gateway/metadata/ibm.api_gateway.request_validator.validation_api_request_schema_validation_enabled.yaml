title: Enforce API Request Schema Validation in IBM API Gateway
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling API request schema validation is critical for ensuring that incoming
  requests meet predefined criteria, thus preventing malicious data from entering
  your system. This validation helps to maintain the integrity of your applications
  by filtering out malformed or potentially harmful requests, reducing the risk of
  security vulnerabilities and data breaches. It also aids in maintaining compliance
  with industry standards that require stringent input validation measures.
description: This security rule verifies that the request schema validation feature
  is enabled for the IBM API Gateway request validator. By enforcing schema validation,
  the API Gateway ensures that all incoming requests adhere to the defined API contract,
  effectively reducing the risk of injection attacks and other common vulnerabilities.
  This practice not only enhances the security posture of your applications but also
  supports compliance with regulations and industry standards that mandate secure
  data handling and processing. Enabling this feature contributes to a robust security
  framework that safeguards sensitive information and maintains service reliability.
