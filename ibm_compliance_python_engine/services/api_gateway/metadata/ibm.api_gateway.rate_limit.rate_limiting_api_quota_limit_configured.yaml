title: Ensure API Gateway Rate Limiting Quota is Configured
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring rate limiting quotas for APIs is crucial to protect against
  excessive usage that could lead to service disruption and increased operational
  costs. Without proper rate limiting, APIs are vulnerable to abuse and denial-of-service
  attacks, potentially compromising availability and reliability. Establishing these
  quotas not only enhances security but also aligns with best practices for resource
  management and compliance requirements.
description: This rule checks if rate limiting API quota limits are configured within
  the IBM Cloud API Gateway service. Rate limiting is a critical security measure
  that controls the number of requests an API can handle over a specified timeframe,
  preventing overload and ensuring fair usage among clients. By enforcing quota limits,
  organizations can mitigate risks associated with API overuse, safeguard performance,
  and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. Proper configuration of rate
  limits contributes to a robust security posture by ensuring that APIs operate within
  safe and controlled parameters.
