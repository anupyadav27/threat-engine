title: Ensure Reasonable Cache TTL for API Gateway Authorizer
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Setting a reasonable Time-to-Live (TTL) for the cache in the API Gateway
  authorizer is crucial for balancing performance and security. A properly configured
  TTL ensures that authorizations are refreshed periodically, minimizing the risk
  of unauthorized access due to stale credentials while maintaining efficient API
  performance.
description: This rule checks whether the TTL for caching in the platform authorizer
  of IBM Cloud's API Gateway is set to a reasonable duration. By ensuring the TTL
  is neither too long nor too short, the rule enhances security by ensuring that cached
  authorizations are frequently updated, reducing the window for potential misuse
  of outdated credentials. A well-configured TTL supports compliance with security
  standards by maintaining effective security monitoring and governance practices
  over API access controls.
