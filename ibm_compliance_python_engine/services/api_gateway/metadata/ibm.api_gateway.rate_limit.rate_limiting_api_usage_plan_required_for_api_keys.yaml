rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.rate_limit.rate_limiting_api_usage_plan_required_for_api_keys
title: Enforce Rate Limiting Usage Plans for API Keys in IBM API Gateway
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing rate limiting on API keys is crucial to prevent abuse and overuse
  of APIs, which can lead to service disruption and increased operational costs. By
  mandating usage plans, organizations can protect sensitive data, maintain service
  quality, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that every API key within the IBM API Gateway is associated
  with a rate limiting API usage plan. Rate limiting is a security measure that controls
  the number of API requests a client can make within a specified timeframe, preventing
  denial-of-service attacks and ensuring fair usage of resources. Implementing this
  requirement enhances data protection by mitigating the risk of excessive data exposure
  and helps organizations comply with regulatory standards by ensuring controlled
  access to data services.
