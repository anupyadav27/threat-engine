title: Ensure Rate Limiting Configured for API Gateway Stages
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring rate limits for API Gateway stages is crucial for protecting
  APIs from excessive requests that could lead to denial of service or increased operational
  costs. By managing request rates, you can safeguard backend services from overload
  and ensure fair usage among consumers, maintaining service availability and performance.
description: This rule checks whether rate limiting is configured for API stages in
  the IBM Cloud API Gateway service. Rate limiting controls the number of requests
  an API can handle over a specific time frame, providing critical protection against
  abuse and ensuring resource allocation aligns with business policies. Properly configured
  rate limits help in mitigating risks associated with traffic spikes and unauthorized
  access attempts, contributing to compliance with industry standards and regulations
  by ensuring secure and reliable API management.
