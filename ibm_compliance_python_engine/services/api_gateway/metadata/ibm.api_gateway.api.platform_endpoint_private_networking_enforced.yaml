title: Enforce Private Networking for IBM Cloud API Gateway Endpoints
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for API Gateway endpoints is crucial to safeguarding
  sensitive data and ensuring secure communication between services. By restricting
  API access to private networks, organizations can prevent unauthorized public access,
  reducing the risk of data breaches and malicious attacks. This security measure
  helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of business-critical applications,
  ultimately protecting the organization’s reputation and compliance posture.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud API Gateway endpoints are configured
  to utilize platform private networking. By enforcing private networking, APIs are
  accessible only within the organization's secured network environment, effectively
  isolating them from the public internet. This configuration enhances security by
  minimizing exposure to external threats and ensuring that only trusted network entities
  can interact with the APIs. Compliance with this rule helps organizations adhere
  to established network security standards and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR
  and HIPAA, by implementing robust network access controls.
