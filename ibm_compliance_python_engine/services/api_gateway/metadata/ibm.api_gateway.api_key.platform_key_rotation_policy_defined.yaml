title: Enforce API Key Rotation Policy for IBM API Gateway
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Implementing a key rotation policy for API keys is crucial to minimize
  the risk of unauthorized access resulting from compromised credentials. Regularly
  rotating API keys ensures that any potentially exposed keys are replaced, thereby
  reducing the attack surface and maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of
  your applications and data.
description: This rule checks whether a platform key rotation policy is defined for
  API keys within the IBM Cloud API Gateway service. Having a defined key rotation
  policy ensures that API keys are systematically rotated at specified intervals,
  which mitigates the risk of key leakage and limits the exposure time of any compromised
  keys. This proactive approach not only strengthens security posture but also aids
  in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations that mandate stringent
  key management practices.
