title: Ensure WAF ACL is Attached to API Gateway for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) to
  an API Gateway is crucial for protecting APIs from malicious internet traffic and
  mitigating potential security threats. By enforcing a WAF ACL, organizations can
  prevent common web exploits that can compromise sensitive data, ensuring the integrity
  and availability of their services.
description: This rule checks whether a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control
  List (ACL) is attached to an API Gateway, which serves as a critical line of defense
  against web-based attacks. Implementing a WAF ACL helps in detecting and blocking
  malicious requests, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other vulnerabilities.
  Ensuring a WAF ACL is attached not only strengthens security posture but also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements by adhering to best practices for API protection.
