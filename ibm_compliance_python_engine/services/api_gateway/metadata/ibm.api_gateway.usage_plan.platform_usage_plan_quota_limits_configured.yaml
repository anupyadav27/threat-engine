rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.usage_plan.platform_usage_plan_quota_limits_configured
title: Ensure Quota Limits Configured for API Gateway Usage Plans
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring quota limits on API Gateway usage plans is crucial for preventing
  resource overuse, which can lead to service disruptions and unexpected cost increases.
  By enforcing these limits, organizations ensure that APIs are consumed within predefined
  thresholds, maintaining service quality and protecting against abuse or accidental
  spikes in usage.
description: This rule checks that quota limits are set on usage plans within the
  IBM API Gateway service. Properly configured quota limits help manage API traffic
  by restricting the number of requests that can be made within a given timeframe,
  thus ensuring fair usage and protecting backend systems from overload. Implementing
  these limits aligns with industry best practices for API management, contributing
  to both security and compliance by ensuring that resources are used responsibly
  and within organizational policies.
