rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.authorizer.platform_authorizer_token_audience_restricted
title: Ensure API Gateway Authorizer Token Audience is Restricted
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Restricting the audience of tokens in API Gateway ensures that tokens are
  only valid for specific services or components, reducing the risk of token misuse
  or interception by unauthorized entities. This restriction enhances the security
  posture by ensuring that authentication tokens are not inadvertently exposed to
  unintended services, thereby minimizing the potential attack surface and safeguarding
  sensitive data that could impact business operations.
description: This rule verifies that the audience claim in the tokens used by the
  API Gateway Authorizer is restricted to specific, intended recipients. By ensuring
  that tokens are configured with a limited audience, the rule helps prevent their
  use outside of the intended context, thereby mitigating risks associated with token
  replay attacks and unauthorized access. Implementing this restriction aligns with
  best practices for secure token management and contributes to compliance with security
  standards and regulations that mandate strict access controls over authentication
  mechanisms.
