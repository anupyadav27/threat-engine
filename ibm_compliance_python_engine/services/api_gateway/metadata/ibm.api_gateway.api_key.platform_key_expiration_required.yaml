rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.api_key.platform_key_expiration_required
title: Enforce Expiration on API Gateway Platform API Keys
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Implementing expiration for API keys on IBM Cloud API Gateway ensures that
  access credentials are regularly rotated, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access
  due to compromised or forgotten keys. This practice is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and privacy, as expired keys reduce the attack surface by ensuring that
  stale or unused keys do not provide an entry point for attackers.
description: This rule verifies that all API keys generated for use with the IBM Cloud
  API Gateway have an expiration date set. By enforcing expiration policies, organizations
  can mandate regular key rotation, which enhances security by minimizing the window
  during which a key could be exploited if compromised. This practice aligns with
  industry standards and compliance frameworks that advocate for periodic credential
  renewal, thus strengthening the overall security posture and ensuring adherence
  to data protection regulations.
