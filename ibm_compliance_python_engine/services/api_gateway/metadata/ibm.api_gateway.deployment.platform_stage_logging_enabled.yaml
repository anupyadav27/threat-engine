rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.deployment.platform_stage_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Platform Stage Logging is Enabled for API Gateway Deployments
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling platform stage logging for API Gateway deployments is crucial
  for monitoring and auditing API activities. It helps in detecting unauthorized access
  and operational anomalies, thereby reducing the risk of security breaches. This
  practice also ensures compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements
  by providing a detailed audit trail.
description: This rule checks whether platform stage logging is enabled for deployments
  in the IBM Cloud API Gateway service. By enabling logging, organizations can capture
  detailed records of API requests and responses, which are essential for troubleshooting,
  monitoring, and auditing purposes. This enhances security by providing insights
  into API usage and detecting potential security incidents. Additionally, enabling
  logging supports compliance with various regulatory frameworks that require comprehensive
  audit logging.
