title: Enforce Throttling on IBM API Gateway Platform Stage Deployments
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling platform stage throttling for API Gateway deployments is crucial
  for preventing service abuse and ensuring fair usage among consumers. It helps mitigate
  the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting the rate of incoming requests,
  thereby preserving the availability and performance of the API services. This control
  also aligns with compliance requirements by ensuring that resource consumption is
  managed effectively.
description: This rule verifies that platform stage throttling is enabled for IBM
  Cloud API Gateway deployments. It checks whether rate limiting is configured to
  control the number of requests that a client can make to the API within a specified
  period. By implementing this measure, organizations can protect their APIs from
  excessive load and potential abuse, enhancing the overall security posture. Enforcing
  throttling not only improves service reliability but also assists in maintaining
  compliance with industry standards on operational resilience and service-level agreements.
