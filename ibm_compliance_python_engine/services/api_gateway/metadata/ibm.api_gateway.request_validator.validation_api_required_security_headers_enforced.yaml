rule_id: ibm.api_gateway.request_validator.validation_api_required_security_headers_enforced
title: Enforcement of Required Security Headers in API Gateway Requests
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that API requests include necessary security headers is crucial
  for protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust with users. These headers mitigate
  various vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting and clickjacking, and are
  essential for compliance with industry standards and regulations. Failure to enforce
  these headers can lead to data breaches, legal penalties, and loss of customer confidence.
description: This rule checks whether the API Gateway's request validator enforces
  the presence of required security headers in API requests. By validating these headers,
  the rule ensures that API communications adhere to security best practices, preventing
  unauthorized access and data exposure. Implementing this validation improves the
  overall security posture of the cloud environment and helps organizations meet regulatory
  requirements, thus enhancing governance and compliance efforts.
