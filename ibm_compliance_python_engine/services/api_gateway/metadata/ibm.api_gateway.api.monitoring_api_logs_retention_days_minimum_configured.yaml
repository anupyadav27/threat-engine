title: Ensure Minimum Retention Days for API Gateway Monitoring Logs
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring a minimum retention period for API Gateway monitoring logs
  is crucial for maintaining an organization's security posture. Adequate retention
  helps ensure that sufficient historical data is available for audits, forensic investigations,
  and compliance reporting. Without proper log retention, organizations risk losing
  critical data that could be used to detect and respond to security incidents or
  to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.
description: This rule checks that the API Gateway service on IBM Cloud has a minimum
  retention period configured for monitoring API logs. By enforcing a minimum retention
  period, organizations can ensure that logs are available for a sufficient duration
  to support security monitoring and auditing activities. This helps in identifying
  security anomalies, fulfilling legal and regulatory obligations, and maintaining
  a robust audit trail. Implementing this control aligns with best practices in logging,
  monitoring, and alerting, thereby enhancing the overall security and compliance
  posture of the cloud environment.
