title: Ensure Burst Limit Configured for API Gateway Rate Limiting
severity: low
domain: compliance_and_governance
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Configuring a burst limit for API stages is crucial for protecting backend
  services from being overwhelmed by sudden spikes in traffic. This control helps
  prevent service degradation and ensures that resources are allocated efficiently,
  maintaining overall system reliability. Failure to configure burst limits can lead
  to potential outages, impacting business continuity and customer satisfaction.
description: This rule checks whether a burst limit is configured for the rate limiting
  of API stages in IBM Cloud's API Gateway. By configuring a burst limit, organizations
  can control the maximum number of requests allowed in a short period, providing
  a buffer to handle unexpected traffic bursts while maintaining throughput limits.
  This practice enhances the security posture by mitigating the risk of denial-of-service
  (DoS) attacks and ensures compliance with best practices for API management. It
  also aids in governance by aligning with organizational policies on resource usage
  and access control.
