title: Ensure WAF is Attached to API Gateway Platform Endpoints
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Attaching a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to API Gateway platform endpoints
  is crucial for protecting APIs from common web exploits that could affect application
  availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. Implementing
  a WAF helps in mitigating threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS),
  and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, thereby ensuring the integrity, confidentiality,
  and availability of data and services.
description: This rule checks whether a Web Application Firewall (WAF) is attached
  to API Gateway platform endpoints on IBM Cloud. A WAF analyzes incoming traffic
  to your APIs and filters out malicious requests, providing an additional layer of
  security by blocking known threats before they reach your backend services. By enforcing
  this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture by minimizing the risk
  of unauthorized access and data breaches, while also meeting compliance requirements
  that mandate the protection of web-facing applications.
