rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_job.backup_monitoring_alert_destinations_configured
title: Ensure Backup Job Alert Destinations Are Configured
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alert destinations for backup jobs ensures that critical notifications
  are promptly delivered to responsible parties. This helps in quickly identifying
  and mitigating issues related to backup failures or anomalies, thus minimizing potential
  data loss and enhancing business continuity.
description: This rule checks if alert destinations are configured for backup jobs
  on IBM Cloud. By setting up monitoring alert destinations, organizations can ensure
  that any backup-related incidents trigger immediate notifications to administrators
  or security teams. This proactive approach not only strengthens the security posture
  by facilitating timely responses to backup issues but also aids in meeting compliance
  requirements by maintaining a robust audit trail of backup activity and alerts.
