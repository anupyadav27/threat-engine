rule_id: ibm.backup.functions_layer.serverless_layer_source_trust_verified
title: Ensure Trust Verification of Serverless Layer Sources for Backup
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Verifying the trustworthiness of serverless layer sources is crucial to
  protect against introducing malicious or unauthorized code into your environment.
  This precaution minimizes the risk of security breaches and potential data loss,
  ensuring business continuity and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule checks if the sources of serverless layers used in backup functions
  are from verified and trusted repositories. It helps ensure that only legitimate
  code is executed, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities or malware infiltrating the
  system. By maintaining a trusted source, organizations can achieve compliance with
  security best practices and regulatory requirements, thereby enhancing their overall
  security posture.
