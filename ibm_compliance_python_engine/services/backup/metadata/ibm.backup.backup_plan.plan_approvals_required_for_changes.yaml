rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_plan.plan_approvals_required_for_changes
title: Mandatory Approval for Backup Plan Modifications
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Requiring approvals for changes to backup plans ensures that any modifications
  are reviewed and authorized to prevent unauthorized or accidental alterations. This
  practice helps protect critical data from loss or corruption, reducing the risk
  of data breaches and maintaining business continuity. Moreover, it aligns with compliance
  standards that mandate strict control over data management processes.
description: This rule mandates that any changes to IBM Cloud backup plans must undergo
  an approval process before implementation. By enforcing a review mechanism, organizations
  can ensure that only authorized personnel make changes, reducing the chance of misconfigurations
  that could lead to data exposure or loss. Implementing this control contributes
  to a robust security posture by safeguarding stored data with encryption and maintaining
  compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. This enhances the overall
  reliability and integrity of data storage solutions.
