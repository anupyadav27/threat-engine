title: Ensure Dead Letter Queue is Configured for Serverless Functions
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Configuring a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for serverless functions is essential
  to handle failed event processing gracefully. Without a DLQ, failed events may be
  lost, leading to missed business operations and potential data inconsistencies.
  Implementing a DLQ ensures that the failed events are captured, enabling troubleshooting
  and retry mechanisms, thus maintaining application reliability and operational continuity.
description: This rule verifies that a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is configured for IBM
  Cloud serverless functions to capture and manage events that cannot be processed
  successfully. By ensuring a DLQ is in place, organizations can prevent data loss
  and enable developers to investigate and resolve issues that caused the failures.
  Configuring DLQs aligns with best practices for robust error handling and improves
  compliance with data retention and recovery policies by providing a mechanism to
  recover and reprocess failed events.
