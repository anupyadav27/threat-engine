title: Enforce Least Privilege for DR Replication Auth Roles in Backup Services
severity: high
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Implementing least privilege for Disaster Recovery (DR) replication roles
  is crucial to minimize the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access that could
  lead to data breaches. Ensuring that roles have only the permissions necessary for
  their function reduces the risk of accidental or malicious alterations to backup
  configurations, thereby safeguarding business continuity and regulatory compliance.
description: This rule ensures that authentication roles used in backup replication
  for disaster recovery are configured with the principle of least privilege. It checks
  that permissions granted are strictly necessary for the role's operational requirements,
  thereby limiting access to sensitive backup data and replication processes. By adhering
  to this principle, organizations can enhance their security posture, reduce the
  likelihood of privilege escalation attacks, and maintain compliance with industry
  standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
