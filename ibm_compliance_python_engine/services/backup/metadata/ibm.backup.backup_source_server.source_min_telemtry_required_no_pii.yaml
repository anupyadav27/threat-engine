title: Ensure Minimal Telemetry Without PII for Backup Source Servers
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that backup source servers send only minimal and necessary telemetry
  data that excludes personally identifiable information (PII) is crucial for maintaining
  data privacy and adhering to compliance regulations. This practice minimizes the
  risk of exposing sensitive data, which can lead to data breaches and regulatory
  fines, while still gathering essential information for monitoring and optimization.
description: This rule checks that backup source servers in the IBM Cloud environment
  are configured to transmit only the necessary telemetry data without including any
  PII. By enforcing this configuration, organizations can ensure compliance with data
  protection standards such as GDPR and CCPA. Limiting telemetry to essential metrics
  helps in reducing the attack surface and enhances overall system security by preventing
  unauthorized access to sensitive user data. This approach also aids in maintaining
  customer trust and avoiding potential reputational damage.
