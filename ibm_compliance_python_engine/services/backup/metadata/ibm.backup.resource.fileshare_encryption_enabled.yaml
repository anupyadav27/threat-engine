rule_id: ibm.backup.resource.fileshare_encryption_enabled
title: Ensure Encryption for Fileshare Backup Resources in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption for fileshare backup resources is critical to protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This measure ensures
  that even if the data is intercepted or improperly accessed, it remains unintelligible
  and secure, thus mitigating the risk of data exposure and enhancing customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that encryption is enabled for fileshare backup resources
  in IBM Cloud, ensuring data at rest is secured using robust encryption standards.
  By enforcing encryption, organizations can safeguard their data against unauthorized
  access and comply with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing
  this rule enhances the overall security posture and supports adherence to data protection
  best practices.
