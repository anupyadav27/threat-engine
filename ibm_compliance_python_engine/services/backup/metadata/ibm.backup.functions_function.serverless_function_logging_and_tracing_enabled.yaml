title: Ensure Serverless Function Logging and Tracing for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging and tracing for serverless functions is crucial for maintaining
  robust security and operational integrity within the cloud environment. It allows
  for comprehensive monitoring of function executions, aiding in the detection of
  anomalies or unauthorized access attempts, and supports compliance with auditing
  standards. Inadequate logging can lead to security blind spots, increasing the risk
  of undetected incidents that could impact business continuity and reputation.
description: This rule checks whether serverless functions within the IBM Cloud have
  logging and tracing capabilities enabled, ensuring critical activity visibility.
  By enabling these features, organizations can capture detailed execution data, facilitating
  effective incident response and forensic analysis. It enhances security by providing
  insights into function behavior and potential vulnerabilities, while also supporting
  compliance with regulatory requirements through detailed audit trails. The implementation
  of comprehensive logging and tracing aligns with best practices in cloud security
  posture management, ensuring that functions are not only operable but also secure
  and compliant.
