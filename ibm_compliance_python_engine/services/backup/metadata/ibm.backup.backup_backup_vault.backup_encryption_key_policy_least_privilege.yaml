rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_vault.backup_encryption_key_policy_least_privilege
title: Enforce Least Privilege for Backup Encryption Key Policies
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that backup encryption keys are managed with the least privilege
  principle minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches.
  By restricting access to encryption keys, organizations can protect sensitive data
  from insider threats and external attacks, which is crucial for maintaining trust
  and compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule checks that access to backup encryption keys within IBM Cloud's
  backup vaults is restricted according to the principle of least privilege. It ensures
  that only authorized personnel and services have the necessary permissions to access
  encryption keys, thereby reducing the attack surface. Implementing this rule enhances
  security by limiting potential exposure of sensitive data and helps organizations
  align with compliance frameworks that mandate stringent data protection measures,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
