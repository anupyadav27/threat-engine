title: Ensure Backup Job Roles Adhere to Least Privilege Principle
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle for backup job roles minimizes
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This practice is crucial
  for safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access
  to backup operations, thereby reducing the attack surface and potential insider
  threats.
description: This rule verifies that roles assigned to backup jobs are configured
  following the least privilege principle within the IBM Cloud environment. It checks
  that users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their specific
  tasks, without excess privileges that could be exploited. By enforcing least privilege,
  organizations not only enhance their security posture but also align with compliance
  standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and GDPR, which mandate strict access controls to
  protect data integrity and confidentiality.
