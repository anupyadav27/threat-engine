rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_recovery_instance.instance_security_groups_restrictive
title: Restrict Instance Security Groups for Backup Recovery Instances
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Implementing restrictive security groups for backup recovery instances
  minimizes unauthorized access and limits exposure to potential threats. This practice
  ensures that only essential network traffic is allowed, thereby reducing the risk
  of data breaches and ensuring the integrity of backup data, which is critical for
  business continuity.
description: This rule checks the configuration of security groups associated with
  IBM Cloud backup recovery instances to ensure they adhere to the principle of least
  privilege. By verifying that security groups are restrictive, the rule helps to
  prevent unnecessary inbound or outbound network traffic, thereby enhancing the overall
  security posture. Complying with this rule supports adherence to industry standards
  and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by ensuring that sensitive
  backup data is adequately protected against unauthorized access.
