title: Ensure Server In Transit Encryption for IBM Cloud Backup Resources
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling server in transit encryption for backup resources on IBM Cloud
  is crucial for protecting sensitive data as it moves across networks. This practice
  mitigates the risk of data interception and unauthorized access during transmission,
  aligning with industry standards and regulatory compliance requirements. Failure
  to encrypt data in transit can lead to significant security breaches, resulting
  in financial loss and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that server in transit encryption is enabled for backup
  resources on IBM Cloud. The check ensures that data being transmitted between the
  client and server is protected using secure encryption protocols. By enforcing this
  security measure, organizations can safeguard their data from potential interception
  during transit, thereby enhancing their overall security posture. Moreover, implementing
  encryption in transit is a critical component of compliance frameworks such as GDPR,
  HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate the protection of data throughout its lifecycle.
