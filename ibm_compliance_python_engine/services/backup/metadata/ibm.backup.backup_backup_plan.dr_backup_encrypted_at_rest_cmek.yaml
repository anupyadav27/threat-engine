title: Ensure DR Backups Use CMEK for Encryption at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting disaster recovery (DR) backups with customer-managed encryption
  keys (CMEK) ensures that organizations maintain control over their encryption keys,
  significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized data access. This practice enhances
  data protection and privacy, aligning with regulatory requirements and business
  continuity objectives by safeguarding sensitive data during storage.
description: This rule verifies that DR backups within IBM Cloud's backup service
  are encrypted at rest using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). By employing
  CMEK, organizations have full control over the encryption process and keys, allowing
  them to manage key rotation and revocation according to their security policies.
  This approach not only strengthens the security posture of stored data but also
  ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations, thereby minimizing potential
  data breaches and financial liabilities.
