rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_restore_job.dr_restore_from_encrypted_backups_only
title: Ensure Disaster Recovery Restores Utilize Encrypted Backups Only
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Utilizing encrypted backups for disaster recovery (DR) restores is crucial
  to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Failure to enforce
  encryption can lead to unauthorized data access during recovery, potentially exposing
  sensitive information and leading to compliance violations and financial penalties.
description: This rule verifies that all disaster recovery restore operations on IBM
  Cloud are performed using only encrypted backups. By enforcing encryption at rest,
  this rule ensures that data remains protected from unauthorized access even during
  the recovery process. Implementing this rule enhances overall data security posture
  by mitigating risks associated with data breaches and aligns with industry best
  practices and regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy.
