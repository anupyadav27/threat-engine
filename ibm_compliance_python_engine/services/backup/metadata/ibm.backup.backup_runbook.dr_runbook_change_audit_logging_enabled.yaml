title: Ensure Audit Logging for DR Runbook Changes is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Disaster Recovery (DR) runbook changes is crucial
  to maintain a secure and compliant cloud environment. It helps organizations detect
  unauthorized modifications, ensuring the integrity and reliability of DR strategies.
  This minimizes the risk of data loss and ensures business continuity by providing
  a verifiable audit trail of changes.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for any changes made
  to backup runbooks within the IBM Cloud environment. By logging these changes, organizations
  can track and monitor modifications, ensuring that only authorized personnel are
  making updates. This practice not only enhances security by preventing unauthorized
  access and alterations but also supports compliance with industry regulations and
  standards that mandate audit logging. Implementing this rule helps in maintaining
  a robust security posture by providing detailed insights into runbook modifications,
  facilitating easier incident response and forensic investigations.
