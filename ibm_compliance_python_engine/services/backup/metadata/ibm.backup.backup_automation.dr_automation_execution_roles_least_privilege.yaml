title: Enforce Least Privilege for DR Automation Execution Roles in IBM Cloud Backup
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for Disaster Recovery (DR)
  automation execution roles is crucial to minimize security risks by limiting access
  rights to the bare minimum necessary for performing specific tasks. This approach
  helps prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of sensitive backup operations,
  safeguarding critical business data and ensuring compliance with security standards.
description: This security rule ensures that roles associated with DR automation execution
  possess only the necessary permissions required for their functions in IBM Cloud
  Backup services. By checking that these roles do not have excessive privileges,
  the rule reduces the attack surface, mitigating the risk of unauthorized actions
  that could compromise data integrity and availability. Adhering to this rule not
  only enhances security but also aligns with best practices for compliance, such
  as those outlined in regulatory frameworks that mandate strict access controls.
