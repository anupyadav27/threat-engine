rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_replication.dr_replication_lag_monitoring_alerts_enabled
title: Enable Alerts for DR Replication Lag in IBM Cloud Backup Services
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring that Disaster Recovery (DR) replication lag monitoring alerts
  are enabled is crucial for maintaining data availability and integrity. Without
  timely alerts, significant replication lags could go unnoticed, potentially leading
  to data loss or prolonged downtime during a disaster recovery scenario. This rule
  supports business continuity and minimizes operational disruptions by allowing prompt
  responses to replication issues.
description: This rule verifies that alerts for DR replication lag are enabled within
  IBM Cloud's backup replication services. By actively monitoring the replication
  lag between primary and DR sites, organizations can quickly identify and rectify
  any discrepancies, ensuring data is consistently synchronized. Enabling these alerts
  enhances the security posture by providing early warnings of potential issues, allowing
  for quicker mitigation. Moreover, this practice aligns with compliance standards
  that mandate regular monitoring and alerting on data replication processes to safeguard
  critical business information.
