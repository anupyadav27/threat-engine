title: Ensure TLS Encryption for Backup DR Replication In Transit
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring encryption in transit for disaster recovery (DR) replication is
  crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access during transmission.
  Without this encryption, data could be intercepted and potentially compromised,
  leading to data breaches, loss of customer trust, and potential regulatory penalties.
  Implementing TLS secures the data channel, enhances confidentiality, and meets compliance
  requirements.
description: This security rule checks that all data transferred during DR replication
  on IBM Cloud's backup services is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security).
  TLS provides end-to-end encryption, ensuring that data remains protected from interception
  between source and destination. By enforcing TLS encryption, this rule not only
  strengthens data security but also aligns with industry standards and regulatory
  mandates for data protection and privacy. Compliance with this rule helps organizations
  safeguard their data integrity and confidentiality during replication processes,
  minimizing risks associated with data leaks and enhancing overall security posture.
