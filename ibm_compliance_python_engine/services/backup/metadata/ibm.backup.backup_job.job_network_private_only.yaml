rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_job.job_network_private_only
title: Enforce Private Network Access for Backup Jobs
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting backup jobs to operate exclusively over private networks mitigates
  the risk of data exposure over the public internet. This practice ensures that sensitive
  data transfers during backup processes are protected from unauthorized access, thus
  reducing potential data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that backup jobs on the IBM Cloud are configured to
  utilize only private network interfaces. By enforcing network isolation, it enhances
  security by preventing data transfer over less secure public networks. This setup
  not only aligns with best practices for network security but also supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements that mandate secure data handling. Implementing private
  network-only access for backup jobs helps organizations protect sensitive data and
  maintain a robust security posture.
