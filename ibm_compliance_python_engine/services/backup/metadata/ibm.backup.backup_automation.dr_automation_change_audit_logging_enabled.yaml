title: Ensure DR Automation Change Audit Logging is Enabled in IBM Cloud Backup
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for Disaster Recovery (DR) automation changes is
  crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant cloud environment. It allows organizations
  to track and review modifications to DR configurations, helping to detect unauthorized
  changes and ensure that recovery processes remain intact and effective. This practice
  enhances accountability and supports compliance with industry regulations and internal
  policies.
description: This security rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for any changes
  made to backup automation settings within the IBM Cloud. By ensuring that all modifications
  to DR automation are logged, organizations can maintain an accurate history of changes,
  which is invaluable for troubleshooting and forensic analysis. Enabling this logging
  capability aids in identifying potential security breaches and ensures adherence
  to compliance standards, thereby reducing risk and enhancing the overall security
  posture of the backup service.
