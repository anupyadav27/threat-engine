title: Enforce Least Privilege for Serverless Event Source Permissions
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for serverless event source permissions is
  crucial to minimizing the attack surface and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  By restricting permissions to only those necessary for operations, organizations
  can prevent potential exploitation and data breaches, thereby safeguarding sensitive
  information and maintaining business continuity.
description: This rule ensures that serverless event source permissions are configured
  according to the principle of least privilege within the IBM Cloud environment.
  It checks that permissions granted to serverless functions are limited to the minimum
  necessary to perform their tasks, thereby reducing the potential for misuse or exploitation.
  Adhering to least privilege practices enhances security by limiting access points
  for attackers and aligns with compliance requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, which
  mandate strict access controls to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
