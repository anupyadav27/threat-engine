title: Enforce Least Privilege for Serverless Function Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for serverless functions
  is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
  Ensuring that serverless functions operate with only the permissions necessary to
  perform their tasks reduces the attack surface and limits the impact of compromised
  credentials or insider threats.
description: This rule verifies that serverless functions on IBM Cloud operate under
  roles configured with the minimum permissions necessary to perform their designated
  tasks. By enforcing least privilege, organizations can minimize the potential damage
  from compromised functions, as they will not have excessive access to resources.
  Adhering to this principle supports compliance with security best practices and
  regulatory requirements by ensuring that access rights are tightly controlled and
  audited.
