title: Ensure Backup Inventory Resource Discovery is Synced
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date backup inventory is crucial for
  ensuring data integrity and availability in the event of data loss or disaster.
  A synchronized backup inventory allows for efficient and effective recovery processes,
  minimizing downtime and business disruption while ensuring compliance with data
  protection regulations.
description: This rule checks whether the backup inventory resource discovery process
  is properly synchronized within the IBM Cloud Backup service. By ensuring resource
  discovery is up-to-date, this rule helps identify all resources that require backup,
  mitigating the risk of data loss due to missed backups. This continuous synchronization
  enhances organizational resilience and aligns with best practices for disaster recovery,
  reducing the risk of non-compliance with industry standards and regulations.
