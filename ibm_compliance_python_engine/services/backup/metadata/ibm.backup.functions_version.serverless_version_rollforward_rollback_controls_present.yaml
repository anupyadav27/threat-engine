title: Ensure Control Mechanisms for Serverless Version Rollforward/Rollback
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Implementing controls for rolling forward and rolling back serverless functions
  is critical to maintaining application stability and security. These controls allow
  for quick recovery from misconfigurations or vulnerabilities by enabling seamless
  version transitions, minimizing downtime and potential data exposure.
description: This rule verifies the presence of mechanisms to manage rollforward and
  rollback processes for serverless function versions within the backup service. By
  ensuring these controls are in place, organizations can swiftly respond to incidents
  by reverting to stable versions or advancing to newer secure versions, thus maintaining
  the integrity and availability of workloads. This practice not only enhances security
  but also aligns with compliance frameworks that mandate robust change management
  procedures.
