title: Ensure Timely Backups for Effective Disaster Recovery
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Regular and timely backups are critical to maintaining data integrity and
  ensuring business continuity in the event of data loss or system failure. Failure
  to adhere to backup schedules can lead to significant data loss, reputational damage,
  and financial loss due to downtime and recovery efforts. This rule ensures that
  backups are performed within a specified timeframe to mitigate such risks.
description: This rule checks the recency of the last backup operation to ensure it
  falls within a predefined number of days, confirming that backup processes are operating
  as intended. By enforcing this timeframe, organizations can ensure that their backup
  strategy aligns with resilience and disaster recovery objectives, thereby enhancing
  the overall security posture. Additionally, consistent backup practices support
  compliance with industry standards and regulations, ensuring data availability and
  integrity.
