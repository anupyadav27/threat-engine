rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_job.backup_monitoring_metrics_export_enabled
title: Ensure Backup Monitoring Metrics Export is Enabled for IBM Cloud Backups
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling backup monitoring metrics export is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into the health and status of backup operations. It allows organizations to proactively
  identify and address potential issues, ensuring data availability and integrity.
  This capability supports compliance with industry standards by providing a clear
  audit trail of backup activities.
description: This rule verifies that backup monitoring metrics export is enabled for
  IBM Cloud backup jobs. By exporting these metrics, organizations can leverage monitoring
  and alerting tools to gain insights into backup performance and detect anomalies.
  This enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that any deviations or failures
  in backup processes are quickly identified and addressed. Additionally, maintaining
  an audit log of backup activities supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  and internal policies, ensuring that all backup operations meet organizational standards.
