title: Enforce MFA for Backup Admins on IBM Cloud Backup Plans
severity: critical
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for backup administrators is
  crucial to safeguarding sensitive backup data from unauthorized access. Given the
  elevated privileges of backup admins, any compromise of their credentials could
  lead to data breaches, data loss, and potential regulatory non-compliance, affecting
  business continuity and reputation.
description: This rule ensures that backup administrators on IBM Cloud must authenticate
  using MFA when accessing backup plans. It checks for the presence of MFA configurations
  for users with administrative access to backup resources, significantly reducing
  the risk of unauthorized access by adding an additional layer of security beyond
  passwords. By adhering to this requirement, organizations align with industry best
  practices and regulatory standards, ensuring robust protection of critical data
  assets.
