rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_vault.backup_encryption_backup_storage_immutability_enabled
title: Ensure Backup Vault Encryption and Immutability are Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption and immutability for backup storage is crucial for
  safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access and tampering. This practice
  ensures that backup data remains confidential and intact, reducing the risk of data
  breaches and enhancing trustworthiness with clients. By maintaining backup integrity,
  organizations can meet regulatory compliance requirements and avoid costly repercussions
  associated with data loss or corruption.
description: This rule verifies that both encryption and immutability are enabled
  for IBM Cloud Backup Vaults. Encryption ensures that data at rest is protected using
  robust cryptographic methods, preventing unauthorized access. Immutability, on the
  other hand, secures backups from being modified or deleted, providing an additional
  layer of protection against data tampering or ransomware attacks. Implementing these
  measures enhances an organization's security posture and helps achieve compliance
  with data protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that sensitive data
  is adequately protected.
