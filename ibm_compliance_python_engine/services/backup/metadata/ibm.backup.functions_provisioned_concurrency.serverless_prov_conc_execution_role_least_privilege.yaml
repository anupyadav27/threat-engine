title: Enforce Least Privilege for Serverless Provisioned Concurrency Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege for serverless functions' provisioned concurrency
  execution roles is crucial to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential
  misuse of resources. Ensuring that roles have only the necessary permissions reduces
  the attack surface, thereby limiting the impact of potential security breaches and
  ensuring compliance with best practices.
description: This security rule verifies that roles associated with serverless functions'
  provisioned concurrency are configured with the principle of least privilege. By
  checking that roles do not possess excessive permissions, the rule enhances security
  by preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized resource access. This practice
  supports compliance with identity and access management standards and reduces the
  risk of breaches by ensuring roles are restricted to only what is necessary for
  their function.
