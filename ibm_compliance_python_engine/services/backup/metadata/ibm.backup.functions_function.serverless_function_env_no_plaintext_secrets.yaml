rule_id: ibm.backup.functions_function.serverless_function_env_no_plaintext_secrets
title: Prevent Plaintext Secrets in Serverless Function Environments
severity: high
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Storing secrets in plaintext within serverless function environments can
  lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. This exposure poses significant business
  risks, including potential financial loss, reputational damage, and non-compliance
  with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
description: This rule ensures that serverless functions on IBM Cloud do not contain
  secrets in plaintext within their environment variables. By enforcing this security
  measure, organizations can protect sensitive data from being exposed to unauthorized
  parties. Implementing secure secret management practices enhances the overall security
  posture, aligns with industry best practices, and facilitates compliance with regulatory
  requirements. This rule is crucial for maintaining confidentiality and integrity
  in cloud-native applications.
