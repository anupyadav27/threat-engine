title: Ensure VPC Private Networking for Serverless Functions
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enabling VPC private networking for serverless functions is crucial to
  enhance the security and privacy of data by ensuring that functions communicate
  over a private network. This prevents exposure to public internet threats and mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access, thereby protecting sensitive business operations
  and maintaining regulatory compliance.
description: This rule verifies that serverless functions within the IBM Cloud are
  configured to use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) private networking. By ensuring functions
  operate within a VPC, organizations can control incoming and outgoing traffic through
  security groups and access control lists, reducing potential attack vectors. This
  configuration aligns with best practices for network security and supports compliance
  with industry standards by minimizing data leakage and ensuring secure, private
  communications within cloud environments.
