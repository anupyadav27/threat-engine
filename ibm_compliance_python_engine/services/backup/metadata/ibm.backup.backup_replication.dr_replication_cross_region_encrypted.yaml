title: Ensuring Encrypted Cross-Region DR Replication for Backups
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Encrypting disaster recovery (DR) backups during cross-region replication
  is critical to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. It ensures data
  confidentiality and integrity during transit, thereby minimizing the risk of data
  breaches and compliance violations. This practice is essential for maintaining business
  continuity and safeguarding customer trust by ensuring that even in the event of
  a regional outage, data remains secure and recoverable.
description: This rule checks that all backup replication processes across regions
  are encrypted, ensuring that data is not vulnerable to interception during transit.
  By enforcing encryption, organizations can enhance their security posture and demonstrate
  compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA,
  and others. Implementing cross-region encryption for DR backups also supports robust
  disaster recovery strategies by ensuring that data remains protected and intact
  during unexpected events, thus facilitating rapid and secure data restoration.
