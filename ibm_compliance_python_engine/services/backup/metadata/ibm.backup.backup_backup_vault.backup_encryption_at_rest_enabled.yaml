rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_vault.backup_encryption_at_rest_enabled
title: Ensure Backup Vault Encryption at Rest is Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enabling encryption at rest for backup vaults is crucial to protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. This security measure
  ensures that data stored in backup vaults remains confidential, safeguarding business
  interests and maintaining customer trust. Additionally, it aids in meeting regulatory
  and compliance requirements for data protection.
description: This rule verifies that encryption at rest is enabled for all backup
  vaults within the IBM Cloud environment. By ensuring that backup data is encrypted,
  the risk of data exposure due to unauthorized access or theft is significantly reduced.
  Encryption at rest enhances data security by converting data into a secured format
  that can only be decoded with the correct decryption key. This practice not only
  fortifies the security posture of an organization but also aligns with various compliance
  standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate stringent data protection measures.
