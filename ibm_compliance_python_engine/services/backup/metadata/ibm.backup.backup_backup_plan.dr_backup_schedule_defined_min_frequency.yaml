title: Ensure Minimum Frequency for DR Backup Schedules in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Establishing a minimum frequency for disaster recovery (DR) backup schedules
  is crucial to ensure data is consistently protected against potential data loss
  or corruption. Regular backups enhance an organization's ability to recover quickly
  from disasters, minimizing downtime and safeguarding business continuity. This practice
  also aligns with compliance standards that mandate regular data backups.
description: This rule checks that DR backup schedules for IBM Cloud's backup plans
  are configured to meet a defined minimum frequency. By ensuring that backups occur
  at regular intervals, this rule helps maintain a robust data protection strategy,
  reducing the risk of data loss during unexpected incidents. Implementing such a
  schedule not only strengthens data resilience but also aids in meeting industry
  compliance requirements, such as ISO 27001 and GDPR, which often require regular
  and reliable data backups.
