rule_id: ibm.backup.functions_version.serverless_version_published_and_immutable
title: Ensure Serverless Function Versions are Published and Immutable
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that serverless function versions are published and immutable
  is critical for maintaining a secure and stable production environment. Immutable
  versions prevent unauthorized or accidental changes, mitigating risks of introducing
  vulnerabilities or breaking functionality. This approach enhances traceability and
  accountability, essential for regulatory compliance and audit readiness.
description: This rule checks that serverless function versions are published and
  immutable within the IBM Cloud environment. By enforcing immutability, once a function
  version is deployed, it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity and consistency
  of the deployed code. This practice not only fortifies security by preventing unauthorized
  modifications but also aligns with best practices for change management and audit
  trails. Implementing this rule helps organizations adhere to compliance frameworks
  that require rigorous controls over code deployments and versioning.
