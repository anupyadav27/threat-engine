rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_recovery_instance.instance_private_network_only
title: Ensure Backup Instances Use Private Networks for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Restricting backup recovery instances to private networks minimizes exposure
  to potential external threats, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access
  and data breaches. This security measure is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and confidentiality of sensitive data, aligning with best practices for data protection
  and compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks that all backup recovery instances in the IBM Cloud
  are configured to operate exclusively over private networks. By ensuring that instances
  are not accessible via public IP addresses, this configuration significantly enhances
  the security posture by limiting the attack surface. It helps prevent unauthorized
  access and data leaks, supporting compliance with various data protection standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Implementing such a network access control measure ensures
  that sensitive backup data remains secure and accessible only to authorized internal
  resources.
