title: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for Backup Vault Encryption in Transit
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that backup data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher
  is crucial for protecting sensitive information from interception and unauthorized
  access during data transfer. This practice mitigates risks of data breaches and
  helps maintain customer trust and compliance with industry standards and regulations.
description: This security rule verifies that all data transmitted to and from IBM
  Cloud backup vaults is encrypted using at least TLS version 1.2. Implementing this
  encryption standard enhances data protection by ensuring that strong cryptographic
  protocols safeguard information during transit. By adhering to this requirement,
  organizations align with compliance mandates such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that
  data confidentiality and integrity are maintained.
