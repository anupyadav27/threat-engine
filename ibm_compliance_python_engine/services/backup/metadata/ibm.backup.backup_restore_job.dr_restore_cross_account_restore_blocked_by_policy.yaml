title: Restrict Cross-Account DR Restore to Enhance Policy Compliance
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that disaster recovery (DR) restores are confined to authorized
  accounts is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security. Unauthorized cross-account
  restores can lead to data breaches, violate compliance regulations, and result in
  significant financial and reputational damage. By blocking cross-account restores,
  organizations can enforce policy management and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized
  data access.
description: This rule verifies that cross-account DR restore operations are blocked
  by policy management settings within IBM Cloud. By enforcing this restriction, organizations
  can ensure that data recovery processes are compliant with internal security policies
  and regulatory requirements. Limiting DR restore access to designated accounts helps
  prevent unauthorized data access and potential data loss, thereby strengthening
  the overall security posture. This rule also aids in audit readiness by demonstrating
  adherence to policy controls and reducing the risk of accidental data exposure.
