title: Ensure Authentication for Serverless Event Source in IBM Backup
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Securing serverless event sources with authentication is crucial to prevent
  unauthorized access and potential data breaches. By ensuring that only authenticated
  sources can trigger serverless functions, organizations can maintain the integrity
  and confidentiality of their workloads, minimizing the risk of malicious activities
  that could disrupt business operations.
description: This rule verifies that serverless event sources configured within IBM
  Cloud's backup services are properly authenticated. It checks for the presence of
  authentication mechanisms that limit event triggering to authorized entities only.
  By implementing this rule, organizations can enhance their security posture, ensuring
  compliance with industry best practices and regulatory requirements for access control.
  This measure not only protects sensitive data but also fortifies the overall security
  framework of cloud-based resources.
