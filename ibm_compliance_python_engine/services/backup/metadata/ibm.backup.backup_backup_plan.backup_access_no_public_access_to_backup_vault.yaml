rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_plan.backup_access_no_public_access_to_backup_vault
title: Ensure No Public Access to Backup Vault in IBM Cloud Backup Plans
severity: critical
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Restricting public access to backup vaults is crucial to prevent unauthorized
  data exposure and potential data breaches. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  safeguard their critical backup data, ensuring only authorized personnel have access,
  which is essential for maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule checks that backup vaults within the IBM Cloud Backup Plan
  do not have public access permissions set. It ensures that access to backup data
  is restricted to a defined set of users and roles, minimizing the risk of unauthorized
  access and data leaks. Implementing this safeguard enhances the security posture
  by aligning with best practices for data protection and resilience, while also supporting
  compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
