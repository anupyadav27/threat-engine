rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_test_restore.dr_testing_logs_enabled
title: Ensuring DR Testing Logs Are Enabled for IBM Backup Services
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling disaster recovery (DR) testing logs is crucial for maintaining
  transparency and accountability during backup restoration processes. These logs
  provide valuable insights into the success or failure of DR tests, enabling quick
  identification and remediation of issues, thereby minimizing potential data loss
  or downtime in real-world disaster scenarios.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for disaster recovery testing
  within IBM Cloud's backup services. By ensuring that logs are actively maintained
  during backup test restores, organizations can enhance their security posture through
  comprehensive auditing and monitoring capabilities. This practice not only supports
  compliance with industry standards and regulations but also strengthens the overall
  incident response strategy by providing detailed records of DR test activities.
