title: Enforce Immutability on Serverless Layer Versions for Enhanced Security
severity: low
domain: compute_and_workload_security
subcategory: instance_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that serverless layer versions are immutable is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and reliability of cloud functions. Immutable versions prevent unauthorized
  or accidental modifications, which can introduce vulnerabilities or disrupt service
  continuity. By enforcing immutability, organizations can achieve consistent and
  predictable execution environments, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring
  compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks whether the versions of serverless layers used in IBM
  Cloud Functions are set to immutable. By making layer versions immutable, you ensure
  that once a version is deployed, it cannot be altered or deleted. This practice
  is a key component of a secure development lifecycle, as it prevents unauthorized
  changes that could introduce vulnerabilities or cause function malfunctions. Implementing
  immutable serverless layer versions also aids in audit and compliance efforts, providing
  a clear historical trail of changes and ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements.
