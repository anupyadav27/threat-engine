rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_recovery_instance.instance_volumes_encrypted
title: Ensure Backup Instance Volumes are Encrypted at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting backup instance volumes is crucial to protect sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and potential breaches. In the event of a data leak or
  unauthorized access, encrypted volumes ensure that the data remains unreadable and
  protected, mitigating significant business and reputational risks.
description: This rule verifies that all volumes associated with IBM Cloud backup
  and recovery instances are encrypted at rest. Encryption at rest involves converting
  data into a secure format before it is stored, ensuring that only authorized users
  with the correct encryption keys can access the data. Implementing this measure
  enhances data protection and aligns with regulatory compliance requirements, such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, by safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access
  and ensuring data integrity.
