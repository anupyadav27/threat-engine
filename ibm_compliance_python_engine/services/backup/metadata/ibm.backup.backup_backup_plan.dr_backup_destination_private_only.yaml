rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_plan.dr_backup_destination_private_only
title: Ensure DR Backup Destinations Are Private for Enhanced Security
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Storing Disaster Recovery (DR) backups in private destinations ensures
  that sensitive data is protected against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  By using private endpoints, organizations can minimize the risk of exposure to public
  networks, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
description: This rule verifies that all DR backup destinations within the IBM Cloud
  backup plan are configured to use private endpoints only. It checks the backup configuration
  settings to confirm that no public endpoints are utilized for DR data storage. By
  enforcing private-only backup destinations, this rule enhances the security posture
  by reducing the attack surface, protecting data from unauthorized access, and meeting
  compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate strict data protection
  measures.
