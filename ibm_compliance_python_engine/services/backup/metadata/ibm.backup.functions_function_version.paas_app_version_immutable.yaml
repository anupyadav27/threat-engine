title: Ensure IBM Cloud Functions Version Immutability for Backup Security
severity: low
domain: storage_and_database_security
subcategory: storage_encryption
rationale: Enforcing immutability on IBM Cloud Functions versions ensures that once
  a version is deployed, it cannot be altered or deleted. This practice prevents unauthorized
  modifications and maintains the integrity of applications, which is vital for maintaining
  a secure backup process and complying with regulatory standards.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud Functions versions are immutable, ensuring
  that deployed code cannot be changed post-deployment. By enforcing version immutability,
  organizations can maintain a consistent and auditable history of application changes,
  which is crucial for both disaster recovery and forensic analysis. Compliance with
  this rule enhances security by preventing unauthorized alterations that could introduce
  vulnerabilities or disrupt service continuity. It also supports compliance with
  data integrity requirements in various regulatory frameworks.
