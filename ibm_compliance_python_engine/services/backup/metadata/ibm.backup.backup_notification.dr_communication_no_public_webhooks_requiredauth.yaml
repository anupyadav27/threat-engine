title: Enforce Authentication for Backup Notifications to Mitigate DR Risks
severity: critical
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that backup notifications in disaster recovery (DR) processes
  are not sent via public webhooks without authentication is critical. Unauthorized
  access to such notifications can lead to data breaches, compromising sensitive backup
  information and potentially disrupting recovery efforts. This rule helps maintain
  the confidentiality and integrity of DR communications, safeguarding business continuity
  and reputation.
description: This rule verifies that backup notifications are not configured to use
  public webhooks without requiring authentication. By enforcing this security measure,
  organizations prevent unauthorized entities from intercepting or tampering with
  DR-related communications. This improves the overall security posture by ensuring
  that only authenticated and authorized parties can access sensitive backup information.
  Compliance with this rule aligns with best practices for resilience and disaster
  recovery, supporting regulatory compliance and reducing the risk of data exposure
  during recovery operations.
