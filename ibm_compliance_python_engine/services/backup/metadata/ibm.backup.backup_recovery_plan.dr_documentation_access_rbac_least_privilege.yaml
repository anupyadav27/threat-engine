title: Ensure Least Privilege Access to DR Documentation via RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle for access to disaster recovery
  (DR) documentation ensures that only authorized personnel can view or modify critical
  recovery plans. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized alterations or information
  leaks, which could jeopardize the ability to recover from disruptions and impact
  business continuity significantly.
description: This rule verifies that access to backup recovery plan documentation
  is restricted using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in accordance with the least
  privilege principle. By ensuring that users have only the necessary permissions
  related to their roles, organizations can minimize the risk of unauthorized access
  to sensitive DR documentation. This practice not only strengthens security but also
  supports compliance with industry standards and regulations by demonstrating controlled
  and auditable access to critical recovery plans.
