title: Enforce Private Networking for IBM Cloud Functions Backup Services
severity: medium
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Enforcing private networking for IBM Cloud Functions ensures that data
  and function executions are securely contained within a private network, reducing
  exposure to the public internet and mitigating risks such as unauthorized access
  and data breaches. This is vital for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality,
  particularly for applications handling sensitive information.
description: This rule verifies that IBM Cloud Functions associated with backup services
  are configured to use private networking. By enforcing private network configurations,
  this rule enhances security by ensuring that function invocations and data transfers
  occur within a secure, isolated environment. This setup not only minimizes potential
  attack vectors but also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations
  by keeping sensitive operations off the public internet. Users benefit from improved
  security posture and alignment with best practices in network access control.
