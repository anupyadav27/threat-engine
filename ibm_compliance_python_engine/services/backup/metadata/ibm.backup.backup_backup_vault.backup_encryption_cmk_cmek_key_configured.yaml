title: Ensure Backup Vault Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Utilizing Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) for encrypting backup vaults enhances
  data protection by allowing organizations to control and manage their encryption
  keys. This approach mitigates unauthorized access risks and ensures compliance with
  stringent data protection regulations. Failure to configure CMK encryption can lead
  to potential data breaches and non-compliance penalties.
description: This rule verifies that backup vaults on the IBM Cloud are encrypted
  using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). By configuring CMK encryption, organizations
  retain control over key lifecycle management, including rotation and revocation,
  thereby strengthening security posture. This practice not only bolsters data protection
  by ensuring that sensitive backup data is encrypted at rest but also aligns with
  regulatory mandates for data privacy and encryption standards.
