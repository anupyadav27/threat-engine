title: Ensure Source Encryption At Rest with CMEK for Backup Servers
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Enforcing source encryption at rest with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
  (CMEK) is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data stored in backup source servers.
  This measure ensures that data remains protected against unauthorized access and
  potential breaches, thereby maintaining data integrity and compliance with industry
  standards and regulations. Failure to implement appropriate encryption could lead
  to data exposure, resulting in financial losses and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that backup source servers within the IBM Cloud environment
  utilize Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for data encryption at rest, where
  supported. The implementation of CMEK provides enterprises with greater control
  over their encryption keys, ensuring that data is securely encrypted and only accessible
  to authorized users. By adhering to this standard, organizations enhance their data
  protection strategy, align with best practices, and fulfill compliance requirements
  such as GDPR and HIPAA. Regular audits and checks ensure that encryption configurations
  remain robust and effective against evolving threats.
