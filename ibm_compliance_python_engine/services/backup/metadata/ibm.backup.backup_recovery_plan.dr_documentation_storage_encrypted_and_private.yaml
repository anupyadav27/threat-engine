rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_recovery_plan.dr_documentation_storage_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure DR Documentation Storage is Encrypted and Access-Controlled
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Ensuring that Disaster Recovery (DR) documentation is stored in an encrypted
  and private manner is critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity
  of recovery plans. Unauthorized access or compromise of these documents can lead
  to exposure of sensitive information, potentially allowing malicious actors to exploit
  vulnerabilities during a disaster scenario. Protecting these documents ensures that
  business continuity plans remain secure and effective.
description: This rule checks that all storage locations for Disaster Recovery documentation
  related to backup recovery plans are encrypted and have access controls in place
  to ensure privacy. Encryption protects the data at rest, safeguarding it from unauthorized
  access or tampering, while access controls limit who can view or modify the documentation,
  thereby reducing the risk of insider threats or data leaks. Complying with this
  rule not only enhances the security posture of the organization but also aligns
  with regulatory standards that mandate data protection and privacy controls, such
  as GDPR and ISO 27001.
