title: Ensure DR Communication Channels Are Configured for Backup Notifications
severity: low
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Configuring disaster recovery (DR) communication channels for backup notifications
  is essential to ensure timely awareness and response to backup failures or issues.
  This setup helps maintain data integrity and availability by alerting relevant personnel,
  minimizing potential downtime, and aligning with business continuity plans.
description: This rule checks whether communication channels, such as email or messaging
  services, are configured for sending backup notifications in IBM Cloud. By ensuring
  these channels are set up, organizations can promptly receive alerts regarding backup
  operations, facilitating swift corrective actions. This configuration strengthens
  resilience by reducing the risk of data loss and supports compliance with industry
  standards for disaster recovery and business continuity.
