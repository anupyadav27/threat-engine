rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_plan.plan_storage_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure Backup Plan Storage is Encrypted and Access Restricted
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting backup plan storage is crucial to safeguarding sensitive data
  from unauthorized access and breaches. Ensuring privacy by restricting access to
  backup data not only protects it from malicious actors but also aids in meeting
  regulatory compliance mandates, thereby reducing potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks that all backup plan storages in the IBM Cloud are encrypted
  and set to private to enhance data security. By enforcing encryption at rest, data
  is protected from unauthorized access even if the physical media is compromised.
  Additionally, setting storage to private restricts access to authorized users, thereby
  minimizing the risk of data breaches. Compliance with this rule supports adherence
  to standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations, ensuring
  the organization maintains a strong security posture.
