rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_job.backup_monitoring_alert_rules_for_job_failures_configured
title: Configure Alerts for Backup Job Failures in IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring that alert rules are configured for backup job failures is crucial
  for maintaining data integrity and availability. Without timely notifications, unresolved
  backup failures can lead to data loss or non-compliance with data protection regulations,
  impacting business continuity and reputational trust.
description: This rule checks whether alert rules are configured to monitor backup
  job failures in IBM Cloud. By configuring these alerts, organizations can promptly
  address issues, ensuring that backups are completed successfully and data is protected.
  This proactive approach not only strengthens the security posture but also aids
  in meeting compliance requirements by ensuring that critical data is consistently
  backed up and recoverable. Effective monitoring and alerting mechanisms are essential
  for managing and mitigating risks associated with backup failures.
