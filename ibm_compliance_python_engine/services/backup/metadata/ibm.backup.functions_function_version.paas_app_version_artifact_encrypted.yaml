rule_id: ibm.backup.functions_function_version.paas_app_version_artifact_encrypted
title: Enforce Encryption for PaaS App Version Artifacts in IBM Backup
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that PaaS application version artifacts are encrypted at rest
  is critical for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential
  breaches. This measure minimizes the risk of data exposure and ensures compliance
  with industry regulations and organizational policies, thereby safeguarding business
  reputation and customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that all PaaS application version artifacts stored
  within the IBM Cloud Functions service are encrypted at rest. By enforcing encryption,
  the rule ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access, whether
  it is due to internal threats or external attacks. Encryption at rest is a fundamental
  security practice that enhances data confidentiality and integrity, providing an
  additional layer of security. This also aligns with compliance requirements for
  data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA, which mandate strict controls over how
  data is stored and accessed.
