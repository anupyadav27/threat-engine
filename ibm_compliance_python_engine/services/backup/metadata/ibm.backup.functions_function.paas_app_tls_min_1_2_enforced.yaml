title: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for PaaS App Backup Function Security
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 or higher is enforced
  for PaaS app backups is crucial in protecting data in transit from interception
  and unauthorized access. This requirement mitigates the risk of data breaches and
  ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations, which can have significant
  financial and reputational implications if not adhered to.
description: This rule checks that all backup functions related to PaaS applications
  enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2. By implementing this standard, the rule enhances
  the security of data during transmission, preventing exposure to vulnerabilities
  associated with older TLS versions. Compliance with this rule not only aligns with
  best practices for data protection but also supports adherence to regulatory requirements
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS, which mandate secure data encryption protocols.
