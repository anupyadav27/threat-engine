rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_job.job_logs_enabled
title: Ensure Backup Job Logs are Enabled for Audit and Monitoring
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling job logs for backup jobs is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into backup operations and detecting any anomalies or failures. This practice supports
  incident response and forensic investigations, ensuring data integrity and compliance
  with audit requirements. Without job logs, organizations may face challenges in
  identifying and rectifying backup issues, potentially leading to data loss and non-compliance
  with industry standards.
description: This security rule verifies that logging is enabled for backup jobs within
  IBM Cloud's backup service. Enabling job logs allows for comprehensive monitoring
  and auditing of backup activities, facilitating real-time detection of irregularities
  and ensuring that backup operations are conducted as planned. This measure enhances
  an organization's security posture by providing a traceable record of backup processes,
  which is essential for internal audits and compliance with regulatory frameworks.
  Moreover, it assists in optimizing backup procedures and improving overall data
  management strategies.
