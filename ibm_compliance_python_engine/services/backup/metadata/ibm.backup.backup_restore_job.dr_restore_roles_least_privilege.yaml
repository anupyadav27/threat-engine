title: Enforce Least Privilege for Disaster Recovery Restore Roles
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that roles assigned for disaster recovery (DR) restore jobs adhere
  to the principle of least privilege is critical to minimizing security risks. Over-privileged
  roles can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, affecting business
  continuity and trust. Limiting permissions helps protect sensitive data and maintains
  the integrity of backup and restore operations.
description: This rule checks that the roles assigned to users or services executing
  backup restore jobs in IBM Cloud are configured with the least privilege necessary
  to perform their tasks. By enforcing this principle, organizations reduce the attack
  surface and protect against unauthorized data access and potential exploitation.
  Implementing least privilege aligns with industry compliance standards and best
  practices, enhancing overall security posture and ensuring that only authorized
  actions are performed during restore operations.
