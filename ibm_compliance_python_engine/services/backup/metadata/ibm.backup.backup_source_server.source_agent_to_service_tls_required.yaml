rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_source_server.source_agent_to_service_tls_required
title: Enforce TLS for Secure Backup Source to Service Communication
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring encrypted communication between backup source servers and the
  backup service is crucial in protecting sensitive data from interception and unauthorized
  access during transmission. This not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but
  also helps maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations, thus safeguarding
  the organization's reputation and avoiding potential legal penalties.
description: This rule mandates the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all
  communications between backup source servers and the IBM Cloud backup service. By
  enforcing TLS, data is encrypted in transit, ensuring that it remains confidential
  and secure against man-in-the-middle attacks. Implementing this security measure
  aligns with best practices for data protection and privacy, enhancing the overall
  security posture of the cloud environment. Additionally, it supports compliance
  with regulatory requirements by ensuring that sensitive data is always transmitted
  securely.
