title: Enforce Least Privilege on Backup Key Access in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for backup keys is crucial to minimizing
  the risk of unauthorized data access and potential data breaches. By restricting
  access to sensitive backup keys, organizations can ensure that only authorized personnel
  can perform backup operations, thereby safeguarding critical business data and maintaining
  compliance with industry regulations.
description: This rule checks whether access to backup keys within IBM Cloud backup
  plans is limited to only those users and roles that require such permissions to
  perform their job functions. By enforcing least privilege access, the rule ensures
  that backup keys are not exposed to unnecessary risk, reducing the attack surface.
  This measure not only enhances the security posture by preventing unauthorized data
  access but also supports compliance with security frameworks that mandate strict
  access controls, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53.
