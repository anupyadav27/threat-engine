title: Ensure Minimum Success Rate for Backup Health Jobs
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Maintaining a high success rate for backup health jobs is crucial to ensure
  the integrity and availability of data in the event of a disaster. A low success
  rate may indicate potential issues in the backup processes, which can lead to data
  loss and compromise business continuity. Ensuring a minimum success rate helps in
  identifying and addressing problems proactively, thereby securing data resilience
  and recovery capabilities.
description: This rule checks the success rate of backup health jobs within IBM Cloud's
  backup services, ensuring it meets a predefined minimum threshold. By monitoring
  the success rate, this rule helps in identifying failures in backup operations that
  could compromise data recovery efforts. Implementing this rule enhances security
  by ensuring that backup systems are reliable and effective, thereby supporting compliance
  with industry standards for data protection and disaster recovery.
