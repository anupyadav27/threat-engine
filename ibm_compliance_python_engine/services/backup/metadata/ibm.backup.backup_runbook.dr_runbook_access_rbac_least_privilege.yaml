title: Ensure Least Privilege RBAC for DR Runbook Access in IBM Cloud Backup
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access in disaster recovery (DR) runbooks
  is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or accidental modifications,
  which could lead to service disruptions or data loss. By ensuring that access is
  restricted to only those identities that absolutely require it, organizations can
  reduce their attack surface, thereby enhancing their overall security posture and
  maintaining compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks that the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for DR runbooks
  in IBM Cloud Backup is configured to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
  It verifies that only authorized personnel have access to critical recovery procedures,
  thus preventing unauthorized or excessive permissions that could lead to potential
  security breaches. By enforcing strict access controls, this rule helps maintain
  the integrity and confidentiality of backup strategies, supporting compliance with
  regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA.
