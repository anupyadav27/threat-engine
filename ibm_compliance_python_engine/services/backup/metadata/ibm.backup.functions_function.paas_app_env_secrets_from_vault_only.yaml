rule_id: ibm.backup.functions_function.paas_app_env_secrets_from_vault_only
title: Enforce Vault-Only Secrets for PaaS App Environment in IBM Cloud
severity: high
domain: secrets_and_key_management
subcategory: key_management
rationale: Ensuring that PaaS application environment secrets are exclusively retrieved
  from a secure vault is critical to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality
  of sensitive information. Using a centralized vault for secret management mitigates
  the risk of unauthorized access and reduces the likelihood of exposing sensitive
  data, thereby safeguarding business operations and maintaining customer trust.
description: This rule verifies that PaaS applications on the IBM Cloud are configured
  to access environment secrets solely from a secure vault, such as IBM Cloud Secrets
  Manager. By enforcing this configuration, the rule ensures that secrets are not
  hardcoded or stored in insecure locations, thereby enhancing the overall security
  posture of the application. Additionally, adhering to this practice aligns with
  industry compliance standards and best practices for key management, providing auditable
  security controls and reducing the risk of data breaches.
