rule_id: ibm.backup.function.url_authentication
title: Enforce URL Authentication for Backup Function Access
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring URL authentication is enabled for backup functions is critical
  for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access. Without proper authentication,
  attackers could exploit unsecured endpoints to access or manipulate backup data,
  leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. This rule is essential
  for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of backups, which are often targeted
  in cyberattacks.
description: This rule verifies that URL authentication is configured and enforced
  for all functions related to the backup service within IBM Cloud. By requiring authentication
  for URL access, the rule ensures that only authorized users and systems can initiate
  or modify backup operations. Implementing URL authentication helps prevent unauthorized
  access, reducing the risk of data exfiltration and enhancing the overall security
  posture. Compliance with this rule also supports adherence to industry standards
  and regulations that mandate secure access controls for data protection.
