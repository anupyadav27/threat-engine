title: Ensure Backup Health Failed Jobs Alerting is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: Enabling alerting for failed backup jobs is crucial for maintaining data
  integrity and ensuring timely recovery in the event of data loss. By monitoring
  and alerting on failed backup jobs, organizations can quickly address issues, minimizing
  downtime and potential data loss, which is vital for business continuity and compliance
  with data protection regulations.
description: This rule verifies that alerting for failed backup jobs is enabled within
  IBM Cloud's backup plans. By ensuring that alerts are triggered when backups do
  not succeed, organizations can promptly investigate and resolve issues, improving
  the reliability of their disaster recovery processes. This proactive approach enhances
  security by reducing the risk of prolonged system outages and data loss, and supports
  compliance with standards that mandate regular data backups and integrity checks.
