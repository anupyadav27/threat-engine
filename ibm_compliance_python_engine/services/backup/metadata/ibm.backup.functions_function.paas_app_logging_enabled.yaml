title: Enable Logging for PaaS Applications Using IBM Cloud Functions
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling logging for PaaS applications is crucial for maintaining visibility
  into application behavior and detecting potential security incidents. Without proper
  logging, organizations may face challenges in auditing activities, troubleshooting
  issues, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations, which could lead to operational
  disruptions and increased security risks.
description: This rule checks whether logging is enabled for PaaS applications using
  IBM Cloud Functions within the backup service. Enabling logging ensures that all
  function executions are recorded, providing a comprehensive audit trail. This practice
  enhances security by facilitating the detection of unauthorized access and anomalous
  activities. Additionally, it supports compliance with standards that mandate logging
  and monitoring, such as GDPR and PCI DSS, thereby reducing the risk of non-compliance
  penalties.
