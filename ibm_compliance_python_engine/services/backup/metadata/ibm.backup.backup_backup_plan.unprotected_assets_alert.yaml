rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_plan.unprotected_assets_alert
title: Alert on Unprotected Assets in IBM Cloud Backup Plans
severity: low
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Ensuring all critical business data is backed up is vital for business
  continuity and data recovery in the event of data loss or corruption. Unprotected
  assets represent a risk to data availability and integrity, potentially leading
  to significant operational disruptions and financial losses. By alerting on unprotected
  assets, organizations can promptly address gaps in their backup strategy and mitigate
  these risks.
description: This rule triggers an alert when assets within IBM Cloud are not associated
  with an existing backup plan, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in data protection
  strategies. By monitoring for unprotected assets, organizations can ensure comprehensive
  coverage of their data assets, thereby enhancing overall security posture. This
  proactive approach not only fortifies business continuity plans but also aids in
  compliance with data protection regulations by ensuring that all data is accounted
  for and recoverable in case of an incident.
