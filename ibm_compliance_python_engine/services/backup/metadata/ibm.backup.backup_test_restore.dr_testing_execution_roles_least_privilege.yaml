title: Enforce Least Privilege for DR Testing Execution Roles in IBM Cloud Backup
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the least privilege principle for Disaster Recovery (DR) Testing
  Execution Roles minimizes security risks by ensuring that users and systems have
  only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the potential
  attack surface and limits the damage that can be caused by both accidental and malicious
  actions. Failure to adhere to this principle can lead to unauthorized access or
  data breaches, compromising business continuity and data integrity.
description: This rule ensures that roles associated with backup test and restore
  operations in DR scenarios are configured with the least privilege necessary to
  perform their specific functions. By auditing and restricting access rights, this
  rule helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive backup data and critical systems
  during testing and restores processes. Enforcing least privilege not only strengthens
  the security posture but also aids in maintaining compliance with regulatory standards,
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require strict control over data access and usage.
