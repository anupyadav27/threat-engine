rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_automation.dr_automation_artifacts_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure DR Artifacts are Encrypted and Access Controlled
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that Disaster Recovery (DR) automation artifacts are encrypted
  and private is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and
  potential breaches. Encrypting these artifacts mitigates the risk of data exposure
  during backups and restores, thereby preserving the integrity and confidentiality
  of business-critical information. Non-compliance could lead to severe legal and
  financial repercussions, as well as damage to the organization's reputation.
description: This rule verifies that all DR automation artifacts created through IBM
  Cloud's backup service are encrypted at rest and have restricted access. By enforcing
  encryption, data is safeguarded against unauthorized access and data breaches, ensuring
  compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Additionally,
  access control measures ensure that only authorized personnel can access these sensitive
  artifacts, thereby enhancing security posture and minimizing risk exposure. Implementing
  this rule helps organizations maintain a robust data protection strategy aligned
  with industry best practices.
