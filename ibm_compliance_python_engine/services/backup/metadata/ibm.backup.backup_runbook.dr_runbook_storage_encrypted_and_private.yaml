rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_runbook.dr_runbook_storage_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure DR Runbook Storage is Encrypted and Private
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting and ensuring the privacy of DR (Disaster Recovery) runbook storage
  is crucial for protecting sensitive operational data from unauthorized access and
  potential breaches. By enforcing encryption and privacy, organizations can mitigate
  the risk of data exposure, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations
  and maintaining business continuity during disaster recovery scenarios.
description: This rule verifies that Disaster Recovery (DR) runbook storage is both
  encrypted and restricted to authorized personnel only. It ensures that any backup
  runbook data at rest is protected using robust encryption algorithms, preventing
  unauthorized access. By implementing this control, organizations enhance their security
  posture, protect critical operational information, and comply with data protection
  standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate encryption of sensitive data at
  rest.
