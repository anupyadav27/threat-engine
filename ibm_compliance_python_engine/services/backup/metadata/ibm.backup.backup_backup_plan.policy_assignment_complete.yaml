title: Ensuring Complete Backup Plan Policy Assignment on IBM Cloud
severity: medium
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Ensuring that backup plans have complete policy assignments is critical
  for maintaining the integrity and availability of data within an organization. Incomplete
  policy assignments can lead to missed backups, potentially resulting in data loss
  and disruption of business operations. Moreover, comprehensive policy assignment
  supports compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards, safeguarding
  the organization against potential legal and financial repercussions.
description: This rule checks whether all backup plans within the IBM Cloud environment
  have fully configured policy assignments. It ensures that every backup plan has
  specified policies governing retention, schedule, and scope, which are essential
  for consistent data protection and recovery processes. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can enhance their data resilience and compliance posture, aligning with best practices
  in identity and access management. Implementing complete policy assignments minimizes
  risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches, thus reinforcing overall
  cloud security.
