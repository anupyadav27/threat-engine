title: Ensure Encryption of DR Restore Logs and Artifacts at Rest
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting disaster recovery (DR) restore logs and artifacts is crucial
  to safeguard sensitive data against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
  This practice not only protects data integrity and confidentiality but also aligns
  with industry standards and compliance regulations, reducing the risk of financial
  penalties and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that all disaster recovery (DR) restore logs and artifacts
  within IBM Cloud's backup services are encrypted at rest. By ensuring encryption,
  the rule enhances data protection by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive
  information, even if the storage media is compromised. Implementing encryption at
  rest is a key component of a comprehensive data protection strategy, providing a
  robust defense against data breaches and supporting compliance with regulations
  such as GDPR and HIPAA.
