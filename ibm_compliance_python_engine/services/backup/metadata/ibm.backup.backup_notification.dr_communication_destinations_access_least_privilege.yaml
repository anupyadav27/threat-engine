title: Ensure Least Privilege for DR Communication Destinations in Backup Notifications
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for disaster recovery (DR)
  communication destinations in backup notifications is crucial to minimize unauthorized
  access. By restricting access to only necessary personnel and systems, organizations
  can reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure that sensitive backup information
  is only accessible by trusted entities. This approach not only strengthens the security
  posture but also aligns with regulatory compliance requirements.
description: This rule assesses whether access permissions for disaster recovery communication
  destinations in backup notifications are aligned with the least privilege principle.
  It checks if roles and permissions are restricted to only those who require access
  to perform their job functions. By ensuring that only authorized users can access
  and manage DR communication channels, this rule helps prevent unauthorized data
  exposure and potential data loss. Compliance with this rule supports adherence to
  industry standards and regulatory frameworks, thereby enhancing the overall security
  and resilience of backup systems.
