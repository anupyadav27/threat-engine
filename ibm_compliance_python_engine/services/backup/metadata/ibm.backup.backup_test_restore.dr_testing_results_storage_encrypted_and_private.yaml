rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_test_restore.dr_testing_results_storage_encrypted_and_private
title: Ensure DR Testing Results are Encrypted and Private in IBM Cloud Backup
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Encrypting disaster recovery (DR) testing results ensures that sensitive
  data remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access. By keeping this data
  private, organizations safeguard their critical operational information, thereby
  minimizing the risk of data breaches and maintaining trust with stakeholders and
  customers.
description: This rule verifies that all disaster recovery test results stored in
  the IBM Cloud Backup service are encrypted at rest and configured to be private.
  Encryption at rest protects data by ensuring that it is unreadable without the appropriate
  cryptographic keys, thus securing sensitive information against potential threats.
  By enforcing encryption and privacy, organizations not only enhance their security
  posture but also align with industry standards and regulatory requirements, such
  as GDPR and HIPAA, which mandate data protection and privacy.
