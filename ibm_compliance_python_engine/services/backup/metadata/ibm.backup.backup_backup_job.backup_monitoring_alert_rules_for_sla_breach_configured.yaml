title: Ensure SLA Breach Alert Rules for Backup Jobs Are Configured
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Configuring alert rules for SLA breaches in backup jobs is crucial for
  maintaining data integrity and availability. Timely alerts enable proactive measures
  to address potential failures, thereby minimizing the risk of data loss or non-compliance
  with regulatory requirements. This ensures business continuity and protects against
  potential financial and reputational damage.
description: This rule verifies that backup jobs within IBM Cloud have monitoring
  alert rules configured to detect and notify any breaches of Service Level Agreements
  (SLAs). It checks the presence of alert configurations that trigger notifications
  when backup operations do not meet predefined SLA criteria. Implementing such monitoring
  ensures that any deviations from expected backup performance are promptly addressed,
  improving overall data resilience. Compliance with this rule supports adherence
  to industry standards and regulatory mandates by providing auditable logging and
  alerting mechanisms.
