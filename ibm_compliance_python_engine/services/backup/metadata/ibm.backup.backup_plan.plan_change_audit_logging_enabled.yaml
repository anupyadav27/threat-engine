rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_plan.plan_change_audit_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Audit Logging for Backup Plan Changes is Enabled
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling audit logging for backup plan changes is crucial for maintaining
  the integrity and security of backup configurations. It ensures that any unauthorized
  or erroneous modifications can be traced and addressed promptly, reducing the risk
  of data loss or exposure. This capability also supports compliance with industry
  regulations by providing a transparent change history.
description: This rule verifies that audit logging is enabled for any changes made
  to backup plans within the IBM Cloud environment. By capturing detailed logs of
  who made changes, when, and what changes were made, organizations can enhance their
  security posture by enabling timely detection and response to potential security
  incidents. Moreover, audit logging facilitates compliance with regulatory standards
  such as GDPR and HIPAA, which require detailed records of data management activities.
