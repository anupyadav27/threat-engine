rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_plan.dr_backup_immutable_or_worm_enabled_where_supported
title: Ensure DR Backups Are Immutable or WORM-Enabled Where Supported
severity: medium
domain: resilience_and_disaster_recovery
subcategory: backup_configuration
rationale: This rule is crucial for safeguarding backup data against unauthorized
  modifications or deletions, especially in disaster recovery scenarios. Implementing
  immutability or Write Once Read Many (WORM) controls helps ensure that backup data
  remains intact and unchanged, thereby maintaining data integrity and supporting
  business continuity. Failure to comply could result in data loss or corruption,
  leading to operational disruptions and potential regulatory non-compliance.
description: This security rule checks whether immutable or WORM (Write Once Read
  Many) settings are enabled for disaster recovery backups where these features are
  supported. Immutability and WORM settings prevent any alteration or deletion of
  backup data within the specified retention period, enhancing data protection against
  threats such as ransomware and accidental data loss. Enforcing this configuration
  not only strengthens an organization's security posture but also aligns with industry
  best practices and regulatory requirements for data protection and disaster recovery.
