rule_id: ibm.backup.resource.task_logging_enabled
title: Ensure Task Logging is Enabled for IBM Cloud Backup Resources
severity: medium
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: audit_logging
rationale: Enabling task logging for IBM Cloud backup resources is essential for maintaining
  comprehensive audit trails, which help in detecting and investigating any unauthorized
  access or anomalies in backup operations. This proactive approach not only helps
  in safeguarding sensitive data but also supports compliance with regulatory requirements
  by providing evidence of diligent data protection practices.
description: This rule verifies that logging is enabled for tasks associated with
  IBM Cloud backup resources. Enabling logging ensures that all actions performed
  on backup resources, such as creation, deletion, and modification, are captured
  and stored. This practice enhances security by allowing administrators to monitor
  and review activities for anomalies, facilitating quick responses to incidents.
  Moreover, maintaining task logs aids in meeting compliance standards, as it provides
  a verifiable record of data handling activities, which is a common requirement for
  regulatory audits.
