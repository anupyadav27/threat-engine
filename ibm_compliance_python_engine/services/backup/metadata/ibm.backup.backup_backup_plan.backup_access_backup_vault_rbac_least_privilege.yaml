title: Enforce Least Privilege on Backup Vault Access with RBAC
severity: high
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Implementing least privilege access for backup vaults is essential to minimize
  potential unauthorized access and data breaches. By ensuring that users and services
  have only the necessary permissions to perform their roles, organizations can protect
  sensitive backup data and maintain compliance with security standards.
description: This rule checks that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies for accessing
  backup vaults are configured according to the principle of least privilege. It ensures
  that users and services are granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform
  their tasks within the backup environment. By enforcing this rule, organizations
  can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data leakage, enhance security posture,
  and comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. This approach helps
  in maintaining robust access control and protecting critical backup data from potential
  threats.
