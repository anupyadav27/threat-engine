rule_id: ibm.backup.backup_backup_vault.backup_encryption_key_rotation_enabled
title: Ensure Backup Vault Encryption Key Rotation is Enabled
severity: high
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Regular rotation of encryption keys is crucial for maintaining the security
  of backup data by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
  or outdated encryption keys. This practice ensures compliance with data protection
  standards and enhances the organization's ability to protect sensitive information,
  thereby mitigating potential business risks such as data breaches or regulatory
  fines.
description: This rule checks whether the encryption keys for backup vaults within
  the IBM Cloud are configured for regular rotation. Enabling key rotation ensures
  that encryption keys are periodically updated, reducing the likelihood of key compromise
  and enhancing the overall security posture of stored backup data. Implementing this
  control helps organizations align with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  for data protection and encryption at rest, thereby improving compliance and audit
  readiness.
