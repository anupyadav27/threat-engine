rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.container_analysis_enabled
title: Ensure Container Analysis is Enabled for IBM Container Registry Namespaces
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling container analysis in IBM Container Registry is crucial for identifying
  vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in container images. This proactive measure
  helps prevent the deployment of insecure applications, thereby protecting organizational
  assets and maintaining customer trust. Additionally, it aids in meeting compliance
  requirements by ensuring that only vetted images are used in production environments.
description: This rule verifies that container analysis is activated for namespaces
  within the IBM Container Registry, ensuring all container images are scanned for
  known vulnerabilities and configuration issues. By enabling this analysis, organizations
  can detect and remediate security risks before images are deployed, reducing the
  attack surface and improving overall security posture. Furthermore, it aligns with
  security best practices and compliance standards, providing an additional layer
  of assurance that containerized applications adhere to security policies.
