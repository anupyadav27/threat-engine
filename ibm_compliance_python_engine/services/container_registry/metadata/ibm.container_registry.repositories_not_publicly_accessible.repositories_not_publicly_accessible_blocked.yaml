rule_id: ibm.container_registry.repositories_not_publicly_accessible.repositories_not_publicly_accessible_blocked
title: Restrict Public Access to Container Registry Repositories
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring container registry repositories are not publicly accessible is
  critical for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive container images. Public
  exposure of these repositories can lead to data breaches, intellectual property
  theft, and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in your images by malicious
  actors. By blocking public access, organizations can mitigate these risks and protect
  their assets.
description: This rule checks that all repositories within the IBM Cloud Container
  Registry are configured to prevent public access, ensuring that only authenticated
  users or systems within your organization can access the stored images. By enforcing
  this configuration, you enhance the security posture of your containerized applications,
  reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and align with industry compliance standards
  such as GDPR and PCI DSS. The rule also provides continuous monitoring and alerts
  for any configuration drifts, helping maintain a secure environment.
