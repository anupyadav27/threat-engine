title: Enforce Expiration of Unused or Old Tags in IBM Container Registry
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing a lifecycle policy to expire unused or old tags in container
  registries is crucial for maintaining optimal security hygiene and reducing storage
  costs. It minimizes the risk of outdated or vulnerable images being deployed accidentally,
  thereby protecting applications from potential security threats. Additionally, it
  ensures compliance with data retention policies and improves operational efficiency
  by keeping the registry clean and manageable.
description: This rule checks whether a lifecycle policy is in place for expiring
  unused or old tags in IBM Cloud Container Registry. By enforcing tag expiration,
  organizations can automatically remove images that are no longer in use or have
  not been accessed for a prolonged period. This practice enhances security by mitigating
  the risk of exposing outdated images with known vulnerabilities. It also aligns
  with compliance requirements that mandate regular data audits and clean-ups, thereby
  supporting a secure and compliant container environment. Implementing such policies
  reduces unnecessary storage consumption and ensures that only relevant and secure
  images are retained in the registry.
