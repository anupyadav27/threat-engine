rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.registry_image_scan_on_push_enabled
title: Enable Image Scanning on Push for IBM Container Registry
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling image scanning on push is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities
  before they are deployed. This proactive approach helps protect against the introduction
  of malicious or vulnerable code into the production environment, thereby reducing
  the risk of security breaches and potential financial losses.
description: This rule verifies that the IBM Container Registry is configured to perform
  an automated security scan every time a new image is pushed to a namespace. This
  function checks images for known vulnerabilities and provides a report that can
  be used to address security risks promptly. By ensuring image scan on push is enabled,
  organizations can maintain compliance with industry standards and best practices
  for container security, enhancing their overall security posture and minimizing
  the attack surface.
