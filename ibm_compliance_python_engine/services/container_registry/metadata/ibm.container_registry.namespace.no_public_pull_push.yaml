rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.no_public_pull_push
title: Restrict Public Pull/Push Access to IBM Cloud Container Registry Namespaces
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Public pull and push access to container registry namespaces can lead to
  unauthorized access and modifications, exposing sensitive code and configurations.
  This can result in potential data breaches, intellectual property loss, and compliance
  violations, severely impacting business operations and reputation.
description: This rule ensures that IBM Cloud Container Registry namespaces are configured
  to prevent public pull and push access. By restricting these actions, organizations
  can safeguard their container images from unauthorized users, reducing the risk
  of malicious activities and data leaks. Implementing this security measure enhances
  the overall security posture by aligning with industry best practices and regulatory
  requirements for data protection and access control.
