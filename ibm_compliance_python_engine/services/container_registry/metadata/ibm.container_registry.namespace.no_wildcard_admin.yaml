rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.no_wildcard_admin
title: Enforce No Wildcard Admin in IBM Cloud Container Registry Namespace
severity: critical
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensuring that namespaces in the IBM Cloud Container Registry do not have
  wildcard admin permissions is critical to maintaining a secure cloud environment.
  Wildcard admin permissions can open the door to unauthorized access and potential
  data breaches, which can lead to significant financial and reputational damage for
  an organization. By restricting these permissions, businesses can better protect
  sensitive data and maintain compliance with industry standards.
description: This rule checks that no namespace within the IBM Cloud Container Registry
  is configured with wildcard admin permissions. By eliminating these permissions,
  organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their containerized
  applications and data. This security measure helps to enforce the principle of least
  privilege, ensuring that users and services only have access to the resources necessary
  for their roles. Implementing this rule supports compliance with frameworks like
  CIS Benchmarks and enhances the overall security posture of containerized environments.
