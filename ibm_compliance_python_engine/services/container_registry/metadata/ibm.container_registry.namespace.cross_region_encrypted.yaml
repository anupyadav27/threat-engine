rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.cross_region_encrypted
title: Enforce Cross-Region Encryption for Container Registry Namespaces
severity: medium
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensuring that container registry namespaces are encrypted across regions
  is critical for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. Cross-region encryption
  protects sensitive data from unauthorized access during transmission and storage,
  reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection
  regulations.
description: This security rule checks whether container registry namespaces in IBM
  Cloud are configured with cross-region encryption. By enforcing encryption at rest,
  the rule ensures that data remains protected as it traverses different geographic
  locations, mitigating risks associated with data interception and unauthorized access.
  Implementing this rule enhances the security posture by aligning with industry best
  practices for data protection and meeting regulatory requirements such as GDPR and
  HIPAA, which mandate robust encryption measures for sensitive data.
