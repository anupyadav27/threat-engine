title: Enforce Least Privilege for Container Registry Namespace Destinations
severity: high
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Implementing the principle of least privilege for container registry namespaces
  is crucial to minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or actions within your
  containerized environments. By ensuring that each namespace has only the necessary
  permissions, organizations can prevent potential breaches, reduce the attack surface,
  and maintain a secure, compliant state. This approach not only protects sensitive
  data and operations but also aligns with best practices in cloud security governance.
description: This rule checks that the permissions assigned to each container registry
  namespace adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege. By evaluating the
  access controls and ensuring that only required permissions are granted, the rule
  helps to prevent unauthorized access and potential data leaks. Implementing least
  privilege reduces the risk of privilege escalation and lateral movement within your
  cloud environment, thereby enhancing security posture. Furthermore, maintaining
  strict access controls supports compliance with industry standards and regulatory
  requirements, such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, by ensuring that data privacy and integrity
  are upheld.
