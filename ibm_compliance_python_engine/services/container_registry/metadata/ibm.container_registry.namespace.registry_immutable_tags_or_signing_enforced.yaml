title: Ensure Immutable Tags or Image Signing is Enforced in IBM Container Registry
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enforcing immutable tags or image signing in IBM Container Registry is
  crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of container images. Immutable
  tags prevent images from being overwritten, ensuring that deployments use the intended
  version of an image. Image signing ensures that only verified and trusted images
  are used, reducing the risk of deploying compromised or unauthorized images, thus
  protecting against supply chain attacks and maintaining compliance with security
  policies.
description: This security rule checks whether namespaces within the IBM Container
  Registry have immutable tags or image signing enforced. By enabling these features,
  organizations can protect against accidental or malicious overwriting of image tags,
  ensuring that the application deployments remain consistent and reliable. Additionally,
  image signing provides a cryptographic assurance of the image's integrity and authenticity,
  which is a key component of a robust security posture. Compliance with this rule
  helps organizations meet industry standards and best practices for container security,
  enhancing overall security monitoring and risk management strategies.
