rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.registry_image_scanning_enabled
title: Ensure Image Scanning is Enabled for Container Registry Namespaces
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling image scanning in container registries is crucial for identifying
  vulnerabilities within container images before they are deployed. This proactive
  measure helps mitigate risks associated with deploying compromised images that could
  lead to security breaches, data leaks, or service disruptions. By ensuring image
  scanning is enabled, organizations can maintain a stronger security posture and
  protect their cloud resources.
description: This rule verifies that image scanning is enabled for namespaces in the
  IBM Cloud Container Registry. Image scanning analyzes container images for known
  vulnerabilities and security issues before deployment, providing an essential layer
  of defense against potential threats. Enforcing this rule ensures compliance with
  security best practices and regulatory requirements, reducing the attack surface
  by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities early in the software development
  lifecycle. By automating image scanning, organizations can efficiently manage security
  risks and improve their overall security posture.
