rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.registry_repo_private_or_access_restricted
title: Ensure Container Registry Repositories Are Private or Access Restricted
severity: low
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensuring that container registry repositories are private or have restricted
  access is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Publicly
  accessible repositories can expose sensitive application code and configurations,
  increasing the risk of exploitation and compromising your organization's security
  posture. Keeping repositories private or access-restricted mitigates these risks
  and helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of your containerized applications.
description: This rule checks whether IBM Cloud Container Registry namespaces are
  configured to ensure repositories are either private or have access restrictions
  in place. By enforcing access restrictions, you control who can view and interact
  with your container images, thereby reducing the attack surface. This practice not
  only bolsters security by preventing unauthorized access but also aids in compliance
  with data protection regulations by ensuring that sensitive data and intellectual
  property are adequately safeguarded.
