rule_id: ibm.container_registry.resource.container_scanning_enabled
title: Enforce Container Scanning for Enhanced Security in IBM Cloud Registry
severity: low
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling container scanning is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities
  and threats in container images before they are deployed in production environments.
  This proactive measure aids in mitigating potential security risks that could lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions, thus preserving the
  integrity and reliability of business operations.
description: This rule verifies that container scanning is enabled within the IBM
  Cloud Container Registry. By ensuring that all container images are scanned for
  vulnerabilities, organizations can detect and address security flaws early in the
  development lifecycle. This practice not only enhances the security posture by preventing
  the deployment of compromised images but also supports compliance with industry
  standards and regulations, such as CIS Benchmarks and NIST guidelines, by maintaining
  a secure container environment.
