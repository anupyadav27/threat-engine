rule_id: ibm.container_registry.namespace.registry_vulnerability_alerts_critical_high_medium_enabled
title: Enable Critical, High, and Medium Vulnerability Alerts in IBM Container Registry
severity: medium
domain: container_and_kubernetes_security
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Enabling vulnerability alerts for critical, high, and medium severity vulnerabilities
  in your container registry ensures that potential security risks are identified
  and addressed promptly. This proactive measure helps prevent exploitation by malicious
  actors, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of applications.
  Non-compliance with this rule may lead to breaches, financial losses, and reputational
  damage.
description: This rule mandates the activation of registry vulnerability alerts for
  critical, high, and medium severity issues within IBM Container Registry namespaces.
  By continuously monitoring and receiving alerts about vulnerabilities, organizations
  can swiftly assess and remediate security threats in containerized applications.
  Enabling these alerts aligns with compliance standards by facilitating regular security
  assessments and maintaining a robust security posture. This practice not only mitigates
  risks but also enhances the overall resilience of containerized environments against
  potential attacks.
