You are given AWS service metadata JSON files (one per service folder). Each service JSON has operations with:
- operation name
- python_method
- required_params / optional_params
- output_fields
- main_output_field
- item_fields

TASK:
For EACH service folder under <ROOT_DIR>/services/*:
1) Generate operation_registry.json with this schema:
{
  "service": "<service>",
  "version": "1.0",
  "kind_rules": { ...prefix rules... },
  "entity_aliases": { "<canonical_entity>": ["alias1","alias2", ...] },
  "overrides": { ...only when needed... },
  "operations": {
    "<OperationName>": {
      "kind": "<read_list|read_get|write_create|write_update|write_delete|write_apply|other>",
      "side_effect": <true/false>,
      "sdk": { "client": "<service>", "method": "<python_method>" },
      "consumes": [ { "entity": "<svc.entity>", "param": "<ParamName>", "required": true, "source": "internal" } ],
      "produces": [ { "entity": "<svc.entity>", "source": "<output|item>", "path": "<jsonpath-like>" } ],
      "notes": ""
    }
  }
}

2) Normalize entity names to snake_case and prefix with "<service>.".
3) IMPORTANT disambiguation rules:
   - If param is "id" and operation name contains "Finding" => entity = "<service>.finding_id"
   - If param is "id" and operation name contains "AccessPreview" => entity = "<service>.access_preview_id"
   - If param is "status" and operation name contains "Finding" => entity = "<service>.finding_status"
   - If output field is "arn" in CreateAnalyzer => entity = "<service>.analyzer_arn" (contextual mapping)
4) Output path rule:
   - For List* outputs, item paths use "main_output_field[].field"
   - For Get* outputs where main_output_field is an OBJECT, item paths use "main_output_field.field" (NOT []).

5) Generate adjacency.json from operation_registry.json:
{
  "service": "<service>",
  "op_consumes": { "<op>": ["<entity>", ...] },
  "op_produces": { "<op>": ["<entity>", ...] },
  "entity_producers": { "<entity>": ["<op>", ...] },
  "entity_consumers": { "<entity>": ["<op>", ...] },
  "external_entities": ["<entity consumed but never produced>", ...]
}

6) Add a validation report at the end (printed or logged):
- count of ops
- count of entities
- list of ambiguous tokens detected (id/status/arn) and how they were resolved
- list of overrides applied
- ensure there is no case where an entity is only produced by an op that also requires it (self-cycle), except when it’s the same identifier echoed back in output.
