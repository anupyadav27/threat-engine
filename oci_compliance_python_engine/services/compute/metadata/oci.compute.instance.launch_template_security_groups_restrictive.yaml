description: Validates that OCI compute instance has launch template security groups
  restrictive configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has launch template security groups restrictive
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
