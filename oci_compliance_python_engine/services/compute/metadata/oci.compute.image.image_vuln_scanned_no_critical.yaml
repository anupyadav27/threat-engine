description: Validates that OCI compute image has image vuln scanned no critical configured
  according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks,
  prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and
  regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute image has image vuln scanned no critical properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
