description: Validates that OCI compute networkacl has allow ingress tcp port 22 configured
  according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks,
  prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and
  regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures OCI compute networkacl has allow ingress tcp port 22 properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
