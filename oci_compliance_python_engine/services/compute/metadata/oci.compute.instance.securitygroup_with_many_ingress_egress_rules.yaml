description: Validates that OCI compute instance has securitygroup with many ingress
  egress rules configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has securitygroup with many ingress egress
  rules properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
