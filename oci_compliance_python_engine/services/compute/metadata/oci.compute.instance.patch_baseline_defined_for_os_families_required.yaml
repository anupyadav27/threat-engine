description: Validates that OCI compute instance has patch baseline defined for os
  families required configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has patch baseline defined for os families
  required properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
