description: Validates that OCI compute instance has instance block project wide ssh
  keys disabled configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has instance block project wide ssh keys disabled
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
