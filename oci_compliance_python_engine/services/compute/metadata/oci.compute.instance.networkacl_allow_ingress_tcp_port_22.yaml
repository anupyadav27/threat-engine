description: Validates that OCI compute instance has networkacl allow ingress tcp
  port 22 configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has networkacl allow ingress tcp port 22 properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
