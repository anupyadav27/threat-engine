description: Validates that OCI compute instance has app env secrets from vault only
  configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security
  risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards
  and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has app env secrets from vault only properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
