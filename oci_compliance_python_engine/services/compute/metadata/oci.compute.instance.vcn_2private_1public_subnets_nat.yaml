description: Validates that OCI compute instance has vcn 2private 1public subnets
  nat configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has vcn 2private 1public subnets nat properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
