description: Validates that OCI compute volume_attachment has ensure unattached disks
  encrypted with cmk configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures OCI compute volume_attachment has ensure unattached disks encrypted
  with cmk properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
