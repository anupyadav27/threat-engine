description: Validates that OCI compute cis_3_1_1_needs_development has cis 3 1 needs
  development configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute cis_3_1_1_needs_development has cis 3 1 needs development
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
