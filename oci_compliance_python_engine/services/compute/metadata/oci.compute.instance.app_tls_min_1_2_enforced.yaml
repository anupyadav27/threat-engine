description: Validates that OCI compute instance has app tls min 1 2 enforced configured
  according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces security risks,
  prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry standards and
  regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has app tls min 1 2 enforced properly configured
  for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
  posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
