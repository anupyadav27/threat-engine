description: Validates that OCI compute instance has securitygroup allow ingress from
  internet to ports configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has securitygroup allow ingress from internet
  to ports properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
