description: Validates that OCI compute instance has securitygroup allow wide open
  public ipv4 configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute instance has securitygroup allow wide open public ipv4
  properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
  a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
