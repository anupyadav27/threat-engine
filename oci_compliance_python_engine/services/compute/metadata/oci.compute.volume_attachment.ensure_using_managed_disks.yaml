description: Validates that OCI compute volume_attachment has ensure using managed
  disks configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration reduces
  security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with industry
  standards and regulations.
domain: compute_and_workload_security
rationale: Ensures OCI compute volume_attachment has ensure using managed disks properly
  configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a
  strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
