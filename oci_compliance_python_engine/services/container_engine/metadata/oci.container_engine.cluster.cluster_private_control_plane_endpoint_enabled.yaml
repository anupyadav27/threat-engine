description: Validates that OCI container_engine cluster has cluster private control
  plane endpoint enabled configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures OCI container_engine cluster has cluster private control plane
  endpoint enabled properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
