description: Validates that OCI data_integration pipeline has data pipeline security
  parameter constraint pattern required configured according to security best practices.
  Proper configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
rationale: Ensures OCI data_integration pipeline has data pipeline security parameter
  constraint pattern required properly configured for security compliance. This control
  is essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
