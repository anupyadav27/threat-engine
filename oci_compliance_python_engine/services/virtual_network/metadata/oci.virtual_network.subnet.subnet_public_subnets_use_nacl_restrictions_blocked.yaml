description: Validates that OCI virtual_network subnet has subnet public subnets use
  nacl restrictions blocked configured according to security best practices. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures
  compliance with industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures OCI virtual_network subnet has subnet public subnets use nacl restrictions
  blocked properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for
  maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
