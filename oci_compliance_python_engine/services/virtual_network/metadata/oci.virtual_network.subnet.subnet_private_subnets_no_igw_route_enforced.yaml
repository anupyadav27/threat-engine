description: Validates that OCI virtual_network subnet has subnet private subnets
  no igw route enforced configured according to security best practices. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures compliance with
  industry standards and regulations.
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
rationale: Ensures OCI virtual_network subnet has subnet private subnets no igw route
  enforced properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
  for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
