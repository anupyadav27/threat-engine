  title: Ensure AliCloud ActionTrail CloudMonitor logging is enabled with 90-day retention
    period
  rationale: Ensures ActionTrail cloudmonitor has logging enabled with 90 day retention
    properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining
    a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
  description: This rule verifies that ActionTrail CloudMonitor logging is configured
    with a minimum 90-day retention period to maintain adequate audit trails for security
    investigations and compliance requirements. Insufficient log retention periods
    can result in loss of critical security event data needed for incident response,
    forensic analysis, and regulatory compliance audits. Organizations may fail to
    meet compliance standards that require extended log retention for security monitoring
    and accountability.

  title: Ensure ActionTrail trails have KMS encryption enabled
  rationale: Ensures ActionTrail kms has encryption enabled properly configured for
    security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
    posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
  description: ActionTrail trails should be configured with KMS encryption to protect
    audit log data at rest. Without encryption, sensitive operational and security
    events stored in trail logs are vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially
    exposing critical infrastructure activities and compromising compliance with data
    protection regulations.

  title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud ActionTrail logging is enabled across all regions
  rationale: Ensures ActionTrail logging has all regions enabled properly configured
    for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
    posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
  description: ActionTrail should be configured to log API calls and events across
    all Alibaba Cloud regions to maintain comprehensive audit coverage. Without multi-region
    logging, security incidents and unauthorized activities in non-monitored regions
    may go undetected, creating blind spots that compromise incident response capabilities.
    This configuration is essential for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining
    complete visibility into cloud resource activities.

  title: Ensure Alibaba Cloud ActionTrail Multi-Region Trail is Enabled
  rationale: Ensures ActionTrail multi has region enabled properly configured for
    security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
    posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
  description: ActionTrail multi-region trails should be enabled to ensure comprehensive
    audit logging across all regions in your Alibaba Cloud account. Without multi-region
    coverage, security events and API calls in non-primary regions may go undetected,
    creating blind spots for threat detection and compliance monitoring. This configuration
    is essential for meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining complete visibility
    into account activity.

  title: Elastic Compute Service Elastic Block Storage snapshots should not be publicly
    accessible
  rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service ebs has public snapshot properly configured
    for security compliance. This control is essential for maintaining a strong security
    posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
  description: This rule identifies ECS EBS snapshots that are configured with public
    access permissions, allowing unauthorized users to view or copy sensitive data.
    Public snapshots pose significant security risks including data exposure, intellectual
    property theft, and potential compliance violations with data protection regulations.
    Organizations should restrict snapshot access to authorized accounts only to maintain
    data confidentiality and meet security compliance requirements.

  title: Elastic Compute Service instances should use least privilege service accounts
  rationale: Ensures Elastic Compute Service instance has least privilege service
    account properly configured for security compliance. This control is essential
    for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting regulatory requirements.
  description: Ensures ECS instances are configured with service accounts that have
    minimal required permissions rather than excessive privileges. Overprivileged
    service accounts increase the attack surface and potential for lateral movement
    in case of compromise. This control helps maintain compliance with security frameworks
    requiring principle of least privilege implementation.
