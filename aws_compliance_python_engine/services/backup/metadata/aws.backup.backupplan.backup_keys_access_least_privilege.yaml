requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'BACKUP backupplan: Backup Keys Access Least Privilege'
scope: backup.backupplan.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures backup backupplan has backup keys access least privilege properly
  configured for security compliance.
severity: high

source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS Backup backupplan implements least privilege access controls,
  granting only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive
  access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates the principle
  of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for backup backupplan:\n\n1. Open BACKUP console\n\
  2. Select the backupplan\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current\
  \ permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n\
  \   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable\
  \ resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n\
  • Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional\
  \ security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n\
  • Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
