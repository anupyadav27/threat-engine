description: Verifies that AWS Backup backupvault has encryption at rest enabled using
  AWS KMS customer managed keys or AWS managed keys. Unencrypted data at rest is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access if physical storage media is compromised, AWS credentials
  are leaked, or insider threats occur.

remediation: "Enable encryption for backup backupvault:\n\n1. Open BACKUP console\n\
  2. Select the backupvault\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n\
  4. Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n\
  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws backup modify-backupvault --backupvault-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\
  \nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n\
  • Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit\
  \ key usage regularly"
