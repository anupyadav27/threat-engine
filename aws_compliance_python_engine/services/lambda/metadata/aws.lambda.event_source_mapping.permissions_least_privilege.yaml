title: 'LAMBDA event source mapping: Permissions Least Privilege'
scope: lambda.event_source_mapping.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures lambda event_source_mapping has permissions least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high

source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS Lambda event source mapping implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum
  permissions necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials
  and violates the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
