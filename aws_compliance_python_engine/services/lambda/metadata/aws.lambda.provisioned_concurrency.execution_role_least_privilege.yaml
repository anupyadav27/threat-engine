requirement: Execution Role Permissions
title: 'LAMBDA provisioned concurrency: Execution Role Least Privilege'
scope: lambda.provisioned_concurrency.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures lambda provisioned_concurrency has execution role least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for AWS Lambda provisioned
  concurrency to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities
  that could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance
  if exploited.

remediation: "Restrict public access for lambda provisioned_concurrency:\n\n1. Open\
  \ LAMBDA console\n2. Select the provisioned_concurrency\n3. Go to Permissions/Access\
  \ Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n  \
  \ - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource\
  \ policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\
  \nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement\
  \ condition keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n\
  • Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
