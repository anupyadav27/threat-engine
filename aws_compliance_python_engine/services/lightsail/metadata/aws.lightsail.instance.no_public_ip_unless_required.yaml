remediation: "Restrict public access for lightsail instance:\n\n1. Open LIGHTSAIL\
  \ console\n2. Select the instance\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review\
  \ current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*)\
  \ principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n\
  6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n\
  • Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional\
  \ security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n\
  • Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
