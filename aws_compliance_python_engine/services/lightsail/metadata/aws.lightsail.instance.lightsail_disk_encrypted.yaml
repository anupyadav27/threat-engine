  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws lightsail modify-instance --instance-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\
  \nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n\
  • Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit\
  \ key usage regularly"
