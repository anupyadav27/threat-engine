remediation: "Restrict public access for sagemaker hyperparameter_tuning_job:\n\n\
  1. Open SAGEMAKER console\n2. Select the hyperparameter_tuning_job\n3. Go to Permissions/Access\
  \ Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n  \
  \ - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource\
  \ policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\
  \nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement\
  \ condition keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n\
  • Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
