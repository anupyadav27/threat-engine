description: Ensures AWS SAGEMAKER notebook instance implements least privilege access
  controls, granting only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality.
  Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and
  violates the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for sagemaker notebook_instance:\n\n1. Open SAGEMAKER\
  \ console\n2. Select the notebook_instance\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n\
  4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard\
  \ (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM\
  \ policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity\
  \ Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition\
  \ keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly\
  \ audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
