remediation: "Configure network security for sagemaker models_vpc_settings_configured:\n\
  \n1. Ensure models_vpc_settings_configured is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security\
  \ groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP\
  \ ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3. Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n\
  4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints\
  \ where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best\
  \ Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound\
  \ internet access\n• Implement defense in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n\
  • Monitor network traffic"
