title: 'SAGEMAKER endpoint configuration: Endpoint In Vpc Configured'
scope: sagemaker.endpoint_configuration.network
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensures sagemaker endpoint_configuration has endpoint in vpc configured
  properly configured for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for AWS SAGEMAKER endpoint
  configuration to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities
  that could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance
  if exploited.

remediation: "Configure network security for sagemaker endpoint_configuration:\n\n\
  1. Ensure endpoint_configuration is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n\
  \   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n\
  \   - Use least privilege\n3. Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n\
  4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints\
  \ where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best\
  \ Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound\
  \ internet access\n• Implement defense in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n\
  • Monitor network traffic"
