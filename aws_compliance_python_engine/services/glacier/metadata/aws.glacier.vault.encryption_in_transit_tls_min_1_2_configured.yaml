  or higher protocols. Unencrypted network traffic is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
  attacks, packet sniffing, and session hijacking, exposing sensitive data during
  transmission.

remediation: "Enable encryption for glacier vault:\n\n1. Open GLACIER console\n2.\
  \ Select the vault\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4. Enable\
  \ encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n   - Customer\
  \ managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws glacier\
  \ modify-vault --vault-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best\
  \ Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n• Enable automatic\
  \ key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit key usage regularly"
