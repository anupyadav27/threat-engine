description: Checks that AWS WORKFLOWS workflow uses AWS KMS customer managed keys
  for encryption, providing enhanced control over key rotation, access policies, and
  audit trails. KMS encryption enables granular access control and comprehensive CloudTrail
  logging of key usage.

remediation: "Enable encryption for workflows workflow:\n\n1. Open WORKFLOWS console\n\
  2. Select the workflow\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4.\
  \ Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n\
  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws workflows modify-workflow --workflow-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\
  \nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n\
  • Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit\
  \ key usage regularly"
