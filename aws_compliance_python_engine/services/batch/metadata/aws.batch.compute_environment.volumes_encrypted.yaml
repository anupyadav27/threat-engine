service: batch
resource: compute_environment
requirement: Volumes Encrypted
title: 'BATCH compute environment: Volumes Encrypted'
scope: batch.compute_environment.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Ensures batch compute_environment has volumes encrypted properly configured
  for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for AWS BATCH compute environment
  to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities that
  could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance if
  exploited.

remediation: "Enable encryption for batch compute_environment:\n\n1. Open BATCH console\n\
  2. Select the compute_environment\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n\
  4. Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n\
  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws batch modify-compute_environment --compute_environment-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id\
  \ <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive\
  \ data\n• Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n\
  • Audit key usage regularly"
