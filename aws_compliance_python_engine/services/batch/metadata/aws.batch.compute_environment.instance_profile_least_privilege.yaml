service: batch
resource: compute_environment
requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'BATCH compute environment: Instance Profile Least Privilege'
scope: batch.compute_environment.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures batch compute_environment has instance profile least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high

source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS BATCH compute environment implements least privilege access
  controls, granting only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality.
  Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and
  violates the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for batch compute_environment:\n\n1. Open BATCH\
  \ console\n2. Select the compute_environment\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n\
  4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard\
  \ (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM\
  \ policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity\
  \ Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition\
  \ keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly\
  \ audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
