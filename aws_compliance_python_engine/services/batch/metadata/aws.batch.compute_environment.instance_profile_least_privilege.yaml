service: batch
resource: compute_environment
requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'BATCH compute environment: Instance Profile Least Privilege'
scope: batch.compute_environment.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures batch compute_environment has instance profile least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high
assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.batch_compute_environment_instance_profile_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS BATCH compute environment implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
