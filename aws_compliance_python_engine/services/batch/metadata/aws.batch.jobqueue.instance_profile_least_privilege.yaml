service: batch
resource: jobqueue
requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'BATCH jobqueue: Instance Profile Least Privilege'
scope: batch.jobqueue.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures batch jobqueue has instance profile least privilege properly configured
  for security compliance.
severity: high
assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.batch_jobqueue_instance_profile_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS BATCH jobqueue implements least privilege access controls,
  granting only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive
  access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates the principle
  of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for batch jobqueue:\n\n1. Open BATCH console\n\
  2. Select the jobqueue\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
