requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'BATCH jobqueue: Instance Profile Least Privilege'
scope: batch.jobqueue.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures batch jobqueue has instance profile least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high
assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.batch_jobqueue_instance_profile_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS BATCH jobqueue implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
