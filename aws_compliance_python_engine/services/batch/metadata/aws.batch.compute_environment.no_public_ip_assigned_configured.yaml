service: batch
resource: compute_environment
requirement: No Public Ip Assigned Configuration
title: 'BATCH compute environment: No Public Ip Assigned Configured'
scope: batch.compute_environment.network
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensures batch compute_environment has no public ip assigned configured
  properly configured for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for AWS BATCH compute environment
  to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities that
  could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance if
  exploited.

remediation: "Restrict public access for batch compute_environment:\n\n1. Open BATCH\
  \ console\n2. Select the compute_environment\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n\
  4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard\
  \ (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM\
  \ policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity\
  \ Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition\
  \ keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly\
  \ audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
