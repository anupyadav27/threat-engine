description: Verifies that AWS ATHENA workgroup has encryption at rest enabled using
  AWS KMS customer managed keys or AWS managed keys. Unencrypted data at rest is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access if physical storage media is compromised, AWS credentials
  are leaked, or insider threats occur.

remediation: "Enable encryption for athena workgroup:\n\n1. Open ATHENA console\n\
  2. Select the workgroup\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n\
  4. Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n\
  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws athena modify-workgroup --workgroup-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\
  \nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n\
  • Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit\
  \ key usage regularly"
