assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.s3_bucket_key_policy_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures Amazon S3 bucket implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions necessary
  for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates the
  principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
