service: glue
resource: database
requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'GLUE database: Policy Least Privilege'
scope: glue.database.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures glue database has policy least privilege properly configured for
  security compliance.
severity: high

description: Ensures AWS GLUE database implements least privilege access controls,
  granting only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive
  access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates the principle
  of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for glue database:\n\n1. Open GLUE console\n\
  2. Select the database\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
