title: 'GLUE classifier: Rbac Least Privilege'
scope: glue.classifier.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures glue classifier has rbac least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high

source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS GLUE classifier implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
