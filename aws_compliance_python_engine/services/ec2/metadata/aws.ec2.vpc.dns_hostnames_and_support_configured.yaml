remediation: "Configure network security for ec2 vpc:\n\n1. Ensure vpc is deployed\
  \ in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary\
  \ ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3. Configure network\
  \ ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring\n\
  5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in\
  \ transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets when\
  \ possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
