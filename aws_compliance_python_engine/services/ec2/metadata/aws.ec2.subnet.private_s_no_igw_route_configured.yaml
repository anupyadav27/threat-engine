requirement: Private S No Igw Route Configuration
title: 'EC2 subnet: Private S No Igw Route Configured'
scope: ec2.subnet.network
domain: network_security_and_connectivity
subcategory: network_access_control
rationale: Ensures ec2 subnet has private s no igw route configured properly configured
  for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for Amazon EC2 subnet to
  mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities that
  could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance if
  exploited.

remediation: "Configure network security for ec2 subnet:\n\n1. Ensure subnet is deployed\
  \ in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary\
  \ ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3. Configure network\
  \ ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring\n\
  5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in\
  \ transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets when\
  \ possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
