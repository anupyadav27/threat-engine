title: 'EC2 spotinstance: Instance Profile Least Privilege'

severity: high
assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.ec2_spotinstance_instance_profile_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures Amazon EC2 spotinstance implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
