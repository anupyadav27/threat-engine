remediation: "Restrict public access for ec2 customergateway:\n\n1. Open EC2 console\n\

  \   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable\
  \ resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n\
  • Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional\
  \ security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n\
  • Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
