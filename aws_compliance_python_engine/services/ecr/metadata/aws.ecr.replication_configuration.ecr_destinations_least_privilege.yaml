title: 'ECR replication configuration: Ecr Destinations Least Privilege'
scope: ecr.replication_configuration.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures ecr replication_configuration has ecr destinations least privilege
  properly configured for security compliance.

description: Ensures AWS ECR replication configuration implements least privilege
  access controls, granting only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality.
  Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and
  violates the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for ecr replication_configuration:\n\n1. Open\
  \ ECR console\n2. Select the replication_configuration\n3. Go to Permissions/Access\
  \ Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n  \
  \ - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource\
  \ policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\
  \nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement\
  \ condition keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n\
  • Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
