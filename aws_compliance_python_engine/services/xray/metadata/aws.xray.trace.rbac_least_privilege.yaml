service: xray
resource: trace
requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: 'XRAY trace: Rbac Least Privilege'
scope: xray.trace.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures xray trace has rbac least privilege properly configured for security
  compliance.
severity: high

source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS XRAY trace implements least privilege access controls, granting
  only the minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive
  access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates the principle
  of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for xray trace:\n\n1. Open XRAY console\n2. Select\
  \ the trace\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
