remediation: "Enable encryption for neptune cluster:\n\n1. Open NEPTUNE console\n\
  2. Select the cluster\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4.\
  \ Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n\
  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws neptune modify-cluster --cluster-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\
  \nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n\
  • Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit\
  \ key usage regularly"
