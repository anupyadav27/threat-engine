description: Verifies that AWS DMS instance blocks public internet access to prevent
  unauthorized exposure. Publicly accessible resources significantly increase attack
  surface, enabling reconnaissance, brute force attacks, and potential data breaches
  from external threat actors.

remediation: "Restrict public access for dms instance:\n\n1. Open DMS console\n2.\
  \ Select the instance\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
