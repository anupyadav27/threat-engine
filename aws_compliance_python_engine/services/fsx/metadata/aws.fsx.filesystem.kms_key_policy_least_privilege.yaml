title: 'FSX filesystem: Kms Key Policy Least Privilege'
scope: fsx.filesystem.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_in_transit
rationale: Ensures fsx filesystem has kms key policy least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high
assertion_id: data_protection.encryption_transit.fsx_filesystem_kms_key_policy_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS FSX filesystem implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
