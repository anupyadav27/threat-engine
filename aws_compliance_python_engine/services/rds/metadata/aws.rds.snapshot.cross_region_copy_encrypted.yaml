  \ managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws rds modify-snapshot\
  \ --snapshot-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n\
  • Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n• Enable automatic key rotation\n\
  • Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit key usage regularly"
