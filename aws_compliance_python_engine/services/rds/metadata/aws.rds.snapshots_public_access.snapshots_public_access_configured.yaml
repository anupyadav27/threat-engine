  increase attack surface, enabling reconnaissance, brute force attacks, and potential
  data breaches from external threat actors.

remediation: "Restrict public access for rds snapshots_public_access:\n\n1. Open RDS\

  4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard\
  \ (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM\
  \ policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity\
  \ Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement condition\
  \ keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly\
  \ audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
