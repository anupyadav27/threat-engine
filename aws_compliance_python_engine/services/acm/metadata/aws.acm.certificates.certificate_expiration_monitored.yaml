remediation: 'Enable monitoring for acm certificates:


  1. Open CloudWatch console

  2. Create alarm for certificates

  3. Configure metrics to monitor

  4. Set alarm thresholds

  5. Configure SNS notifications

  6. Enable detailed monitoring (if available)

  7. Create dashboard for visualization


  Monitoring Best Practices:

  • Monitor security-relevant metrics

  • Set up automated alerting

  • Integrate with SIEM/SOC

  • Regular review of metrics

  • Implement automated remediation'
