remediation: "Configure network security for stepfunctions statemachine:\n\n1. Ensure\
  \ statemachine is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict\
  \ inbound traffic to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least\
  \ privilege\n3. Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow\
  \ Logs for network monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n\
  6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy\
  \ in private subnets when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n\
  • Implement defense in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network\
  \ traffic"
