severity: high
assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.config_deliverychannel_destination_access_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures AWS Config deliverychannel implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
