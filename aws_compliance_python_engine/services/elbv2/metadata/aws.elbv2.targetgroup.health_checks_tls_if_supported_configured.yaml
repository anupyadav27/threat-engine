title: 'ELBV2 targetgroup: Health Checks Tls If Supported Configured'
scope: elbv2.targetgroup.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_in_transit
rationale: Ensures elbv2 targetgroup has health checks tls if supported configured
  properly configured for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for Application Load Balancer
  targetgroup to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities
  that could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance
  if exploited.

remediation: "Configure network security for elbv2 targetgroup:\n\n1. Ensure targetgroup\
  \ is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic\
  \ to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3.\
  \ Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network\
  \ monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL\
  \ for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets\
  \ when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
