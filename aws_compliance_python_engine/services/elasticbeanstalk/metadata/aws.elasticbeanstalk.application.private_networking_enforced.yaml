description: Ensures AWS ELASTICBEANSTALK application is deployed in a private subnet
  without direct internet gateway access, accessible only through controlled network
  paths. Private networking reduces attack surface, implements defense in depth, and
  prevents direct internet-based attacks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for elasticbeanstalk application:\n\n1. Open\
  \ ELASTICBEANSTALK console\n2. Select the application\n3. Go to Permissions/Access\
  \ Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n   - Remove public access grants\n  \
  \ - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement least privilege\n5. Update resource\
  \ policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level access control\n7. Save changes\n\
  \nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles instead of access keys\n• Implement\
  \ condition keys for additional security\n• Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n\
  • Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
