description: Checks high-priority security configuration for AWS ELASTICBEANSTALK
  environment to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities
  that could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance
  if exploited.

remediation: "Configure network security for elasticbeanstalk environment:\n\n1. Ensure\
  \ environment is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound\
  \ traffic to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n\
  3. Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for\
  \ network monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable\
  \ TLS/SSL for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private\
  \ subnets when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement\
  \ defense in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
