remediation: "Enable encryption for kinesisanalytics application:\n\n1. Open KINESISANALYTICS\
  \ console\n2. Select the application\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration >\
  \ Encryption\n4. Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed\
  \ key (default)\n   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\
  \nAWS CLI:\naws kinesisanalytics modify-application --application-id <id> --encrypted\
  \ --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS\
  \ keys for sensitive data\n• Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key\
  \ access policies\n• Audit key usage regularly"
