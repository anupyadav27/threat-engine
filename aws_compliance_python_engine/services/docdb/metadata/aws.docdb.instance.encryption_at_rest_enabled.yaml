remediation: "Enable encryption for docdb instance:\n\n1. Open DOCDB console\n2. Select\
  \ the instance\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4. Enable\
  \ encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n   - Customer\
  \ managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws docdb\
  \ modify-instance --instance-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity\
  \ Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n• Enable\
  \ automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit key usage\
  \ regularly"
