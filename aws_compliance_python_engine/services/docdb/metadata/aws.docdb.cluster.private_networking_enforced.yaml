description: Ensures AWS DOCDB cluster is deployed in a private subnet without direct
  internet gateway access, accessible only through controlled network paths. Private
  networking reduces attack surface, implements defense in depth, and prevents direct
  internet-based attacks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for docdb cluster:\n\n1. Open DOCDB console\n\
  2. Select the cluster\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
