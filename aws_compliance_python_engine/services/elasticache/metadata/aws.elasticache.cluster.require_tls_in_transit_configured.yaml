requirement: TLS in Transit
title: 'ELASTICACHE cluster: Require Tls In Transit Configured'
scope: elasticache.cluster.encryption
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_in_transit
rationale: Ensures elasticache cluster has require tls in transit configured properly
  configured for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for AWS ELASTICACHE cluster
  to mitigate significant security risks. This control addresses vulnerabilities that
  could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or regulatory non-compliance if
  exploited.

remediation: "Configure network security for elasticache cluster:\n\n1. Ensure cluster\
  \ is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic\
  \ to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3.\
  \ Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network\
  \ monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL\
  \ for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets\
  \ when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
