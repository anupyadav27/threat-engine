rule_id: aws.elasticache.cluster.in_transit_encryption_enabled
service: elasticache
resource: cluster
requirement: Encryption in Transit
title: Customer-managed encryption keys are used for databases
scope: elasticache.cluster.data_protection
domain: data_protection_and_privacy
subcategory: encryption_at_rest
rationale: Cryptographic controls protect data at rest and in transit. Proper encryption implementation prevents data breaches
  and ensures confidentiality.

description: Ensures AWS ELASTICACHE cluster enforces encryption in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher protocols. Unencrypted
  network traffic is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, packet sniffing, and session hijacking, exposing sensitive data
  during transmission.
