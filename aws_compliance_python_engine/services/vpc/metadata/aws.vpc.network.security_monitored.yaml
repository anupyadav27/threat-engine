service: vpc
resource: network
requirement: Security Monitoring
title: 'VPC network: Security Monitored'
scope: vpc.network.logging
domain: logging_monitoring_and_alerting
subcategory: security_monitoring
rationale: Ensures vpc network has security monitored properly configured for security
  compliance.

description: Validates that Amazon VPC network has monitoring and alerting configured
  to detect anomalies, performance issues, and security events. Proactive monitoring
  enables early threat detection, reduces mean time to response (MTTR), and supports
  compliance with security monitoring requirements.

remediation: "Configure network security for vpc network:\n\n1. Ensure network is\
  \ deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic\
  \ to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3.\
  \ Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network\
  \ monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL\
  \ for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets\
  \ when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
