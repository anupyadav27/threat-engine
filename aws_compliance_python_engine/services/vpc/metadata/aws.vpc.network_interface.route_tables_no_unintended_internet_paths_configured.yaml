description: Verifies security configuration for Amazon VPC network interface to ensure
  alignment with AWS security best practices and compliance requirements. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, maintains defense in depth, and supports overall security
  posture.

remediation: "Configure network security for vpc network_interface:\n\n1. Ensure network_interface\
  \ is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic\
  \ to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3.\
  \ Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network\
  \ monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL\
  \ for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets\
  \ when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
