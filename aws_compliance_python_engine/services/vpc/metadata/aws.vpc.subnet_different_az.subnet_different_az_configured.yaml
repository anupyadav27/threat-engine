description: Verifies security configuration for Amazon VPC subnet different az to
  ensure alignment with AWS security best practices and compliance requirements. Proper
  configuration reduces security risks, maintains defense in depth, and supports overall
  security posture.

remediation: "Configure network security for vpc subnet_different_az:\n\n1. Ensure\
  \ subnet_different_az is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict\
  \ inbound traffic to necessary ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least\
  \ privilege\n3. Configure network ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow\
  \ Logs for network monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n\
  6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy\
  \ in private subnets when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n\
  • Implement defense in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network\
  \ traffic"
