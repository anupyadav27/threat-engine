title: 'VPC peering routing tables with least privilege: Privilege'
scope: vpc.peering_routing_tables_with_least_privilege.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures vpc peering_routing_tables_with_least_privilege has privilege properly
  configured for security compliance.

description: Checks high-priority security configuration for Amazon VPC peering routing
  tables with least privilege to mitigate significant security risks. This control
  addresses vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure,
  or regulatory non-compliance if exploited.

remediation: "Configure network security for vpc peering_routing_tables_with_least_privilege:\n\
  \n1. Ensure peering_routing_tables_with_least_privilege is deployed in VPC\n2. Configure\
  \ security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary ports\n   - Limit\
  \ source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3. Configure network ACLs for subnet-level\
  \ control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring\n5. Use Private Link/VPC\
  \ Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in transit\n\nNetwork Security\
  \ Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets when possible\n• Use NAT Gateway\
  \ for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense in depth\n• Enable encryption\
  \ in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
