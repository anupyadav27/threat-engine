description: Verifies security configuration for Amazon VPC subnet to ensure alignment
  with AWS security best practices and compliance requirements. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, maintains defense in depth, and supports overall security
  posture.

remediation: "Configure network security for vpc subnet:\n\n1. Ensure subnet is deployed\
  \ in VPC\n2. Configure security groups:\n   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary\
  \ ports\n   - Limit source IP ranges\n   - Use least privilege\n3. Configure network\
  \ ACLs for subnet-level control\n4. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring\n\
  5. Use Private Link/VPC Endpoints where available\n6. Enable TLS/SSL for data in\
  \ transit\n\nNetwork Security Best Practices:\n• Deploy in private subnets when\
  \ possible\n• Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access\n• Implement defense\
  \ in depth\n• Enable encryption in transit\n• Monitor network traffic"
