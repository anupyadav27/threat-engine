  \ log destination:\n   - CloudWatch Logs\n   - S3 bucket (for long-term retention)\n\
  6. Set log level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)\n7. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws vpc update-subnet-logging\
  \ --subnet-id <id> --logging-enabled\n\nBest Practices:\n• Enable all security-relevant\
  \ log types\n• Send logs to centralized logging service\n• Set appropriate retention\
  \ periods\n• Configure log encryption\n• Set up log monitoring and alerting"
