remediation: "Enable encryption for directconnect connection:\n\n1. Open DIRECTCONNECT\
  \ console\n2. Select the connection\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n\
  4. Enable encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n\
  \   - Customer managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws directconnect modify-connection --connection-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id\
  \ <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive\
  \ data\n• Enable automatic key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n\
  • Audit key usage regularly"
