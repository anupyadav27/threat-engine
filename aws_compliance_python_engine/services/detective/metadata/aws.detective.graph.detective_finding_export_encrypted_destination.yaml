remediation: "Enable encryption for detective graph:\n\n1. Open DETECTIVE console\n\
  2. Select the graph\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4. Enable\
  \ encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n   - Customer\
  \ managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws detective\
  \ modify-graph --graph-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best\
  \ Practices:\n• Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n• Enable automatic\
  \ key rotation\n• Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit key usage regularly"
