resource: role
requirement: Least Privilege Access
title: Permission boundaries are enforced for privileged roles
scope: iam.role.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authorization

  unauthorized access and reduce the risk of account compromise.

description: Ensures AWS IAM role implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions necessary
  for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates the
  principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
