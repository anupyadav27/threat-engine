description: Checks that AWS IAM resource requires multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  for access, combining something you know (password) with something you have (token/device).
  MFA significantly reduces account compromise risk from phishing, credential stuffing,
  and password reuse attacks.

remediation: "Restrict public access for iam resource:\n\n1. Open IAM console\n2.\
  \ Select the resource\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
