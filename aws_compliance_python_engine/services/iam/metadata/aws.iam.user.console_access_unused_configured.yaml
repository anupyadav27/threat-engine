remediation: "Restrict public access for iam user:\n\n1. Open IAM console\n2. Select\
  \ the user\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
