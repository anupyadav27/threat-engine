rule_id: aws.iam.user.access_keys_rotated_90_days_or_less_when_present
service: iam
resource: user
requirement: Access Keys Rotated 90 Days Or Less When Present
title: Legacy authentication protocols are disabled
scope: iam.user.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: authentication
rationale: Legacy authentication protocols have known vulnerabilities and weak security.
  Disabling them prevents exploitation of outdated authentication methods.
severity: medium

description: Verifies security configuration for AWS IAM user to ensure alignment
  with AWS security best practices and compliance requirements. Proper configuration
  reduces security risks, maintains defense in depth, and supports overall security
  posture.

remediation: "Restrict public access for iam user:\n\n1. Open IAM console\n2. Select\
  \ the user\n3. Go to Permissions/Access Control\n4. Review current permissions:\n\
  \   - Remove public access grants\n   - Remove wildcard (*) principals\n   - Implement\
  \ least privilege\n5. Update resource policy or IAM policies\n6. Enable resource-level\
  \ access control\n7. Save changes\n\nSecurity Recommendations:\n• Use IAM roles\
  \ instead of access keys\n• Implement condition keys for additional security\n•\
  \ Enable MFA for sensitive operations\n• Regularly audit access permissions\n• Use\
  \ AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails"
