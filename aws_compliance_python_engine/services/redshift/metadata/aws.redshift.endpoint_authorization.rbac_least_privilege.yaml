title: 'REDSHIFT endpoint authorization: Rbac Least Privilege'
scope: redshift.endpoint_authorization.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures redshift endpoint_authorization has rbac least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high

source: expert_generated
description: Ensures Amazon Redshift endpoint authorization implements least privilege access controls, granting only the
  minimum permissions necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised
  credentials and violates the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
