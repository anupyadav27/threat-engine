title: 'REDSHIFT cluster: Admin Access Least Privilege'
scope: redshift.cluster.access_control
domain: identity_and_access_management
subcategory: least_privilege
rationale: Ensures redshift cluster has admin access least privilege properly configured for security compliance.
severity: high
assertion_id: identity_access.least_privilege.redshift_cluster_admin_access_least_privilege
source: expert_generated
description: Ensures Amazon Redshift cluster implements least privilege access controls, granting only the minimum permissions
  necessary for intended functionality. Over-permissive access increases the blast radius of compromised credentials and violates
  the principle of least privilege mandated by security frameworks.
