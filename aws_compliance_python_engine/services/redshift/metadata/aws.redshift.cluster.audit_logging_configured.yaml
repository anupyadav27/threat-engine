remediation: "Enable logging for redshift cluster:\n\n1. Open REDSHIFT console\n2.\
  \ Select the cluster\n3. Go to Logging/Monitoring settings\n4. Enable logging\n\
  5. Configure log destination:\n   - CloudWatch Logs\n   - S3 bucket (for long-term\
  \ retention)\n6. Set log level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)\n7. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\n\
  aws redshift update-cluster-logging --cluster-id <id> --logging-enabled\n\nBest\
  \ Practices:\n• Enable all security-relevant log types\n• Send logs to centralized\
  \ logging service\n• Set appropriate retention periods\n• Configure log encryption\n\
  • Set up log monitoring and alerting"
