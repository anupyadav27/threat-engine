remediation: "Enable encryption for ebs volume:\n\n1. Open EBS console\n2. Select\
  \ the volume\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4. Enable encryption\n\
  5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n   - Customer managed\
  \ key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws ebs modify-volume\
  \ --volume-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n\
  • Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n• Enable automatic key rotation\n\
  • Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit key usage regularly"
