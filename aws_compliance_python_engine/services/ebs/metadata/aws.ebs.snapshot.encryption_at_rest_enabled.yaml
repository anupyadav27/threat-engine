description: Verifies that AWS EBS snapshot has encryption at rest enabled using AWS
  KMS customer managed keys or AWS managed keys. Unencrypted data at rest is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access if physical storage media is compromised, AWS credentials
  are leaked, or insider threats occur.

remediation: "Enable encryption for ebs snapshot:\n\n1. Open EBS console\n2. Select\
  \ the snapshot\n3. Navigate to Properties/Configuration > Encryption\n4. Enable\
  \ encryption\n5. Choose encryption key:\n   - AWS managed key (default)\n   - Customer\
  \ managed key (KMS) for enhanced control\n6. Save changes\n\nAWS CLI:\naws ebs modify-snapshot\
  \ --snapshot-id <id> --encrypted --kms-key-id <key-id>\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n\
  • Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data\n• Enable automatic key rotation\n\
  • Implement proper key access policies\n• Audit key usage regularly"
